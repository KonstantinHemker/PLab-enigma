CHAPTER I
MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
IN THE YEAR I TOOK MY DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF MEDICINE OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON AND PROCEEDED TO NETLEY TO GO THROUGH THE
COURSE PRESCRIBED FOR SURGEONS IN THE ARMY HAVING COMPLETED MY
STUDIES THERE I WAS DULY ATTACHED TO THE FIFTH NORTHUMBERLAND
FUSILIERS AS ASSISTANT SURGEON THE REGIMENT WAS STATIONED IN INDIA
AT THE TIME AND BEFORE I COULD JOIN IT THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR HAD
BROKEN OUT ON LANDING AT BOMBAY I LEARNED THAT MY CORPS HAD
ADVANCED THROUGH THE PASSES AND WAS ALREADY DEEP IN THE ENEMYS
COUNTRY I FOLLOWED HOWEVER WITH MANY OTHER OFFICERS WHO WERE IN
THE SAME SITUATION AS MYSELF AND SUCCEEDED IN REACHING CANDAHAR IN
SAFETY WHERE I FOUND MY REGIMENT AND AT ONCE ENTERED UPON MY NEW
DUTIES
THE CAMPAIGN BROUGHT HONOURS AND PROMOTION TO MANY BUT FOR ME IT HAD
NOTHING BUT MISFORTUNE AND DISASTER I WAS REMOVED FROM MY BRIGADE
AND ATTACHED TO THE BERKSHIRES WITH WHOM I SERVED AT THE FATAL
BATTLE OF MAIWAND THERE I WAS STRUCK ON THE SHOULDER BY A JEZAIL
BULLET WHICH SHATTERED THE BONE AND GRAZED THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY I
SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE MURDEROUS GHAZIS HAD IT NOT
BEEN FOR THE DEVOTION AND COURAGE SHOWN BY MURRAY MY ORDERLY WHO
THREW ME ACROSS A PACKHORSE AND SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING ME SAFELY TO
THE BRITISH LINES
WORN WITH PAIN AND WEAK FROM THE PROLONGED HARDSHIPS WHICH I HAD
UNDERGONE I WAS REMOVED WITH A GREAT TRAIN OF WOUNDED SUFFERERS TO
THE BASE HOSPITAL AT PESHAWAR HERE I RALLIED AND HAD ALREADY
IMPROVED SO FAR AS TO BE ABLE TO WALK ABOUT THE WARDS AND EVEN TO
BASK A LITTLE UPON THE VERANDAH WHEN I WAS STRUCK DOWN BY ENTERIC
FEVER THAT CURSE OF OUR INDIAN POSSESSIONS FOR MONTHS MY LIFE WAS
DESPAIRED OF AND WHEN AT LAST I CAME TO MYSELF AND BECAME
CONVALESCENT I WAS SO WEAK AND EMACIATED THAT A MEDICAL BOARD
DETERMINED THAT NOT A DAY SHOULD BE LOST IN SENDING ME BACK TO
ENGLAND I WAS DISPATCHED ACCORDINGLY IN THE TROOPSHIP ORONTES AND
LANDED A MONTH LATER ON PORTSMOUTH JETTY WITH MY HEALTH
IRRETRIEVABLY RUINED BUT WITH PERMISSION FROM A PATERNAL GOVERNMENT
TO SPEND THE NEXT NINE MONTHS IN ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE IT
I HAD NEITHER KITH NOR KIN IN ENGLAND AND WAS THEREFORE AS FREE AS
AIROR AS FREE AS AN INCOME OF ELEVEN SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE A DAY
WILL PERMIT A MAN TO BE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES I NATURALLY
GRAVITATED TO LONDON THAT GREAT CESSPOOL INTO WHICH ALL THE LOUNGERS
AND IDLERS OF THE EMPIRE ARE IRRESISTIBLY DRAINED THERE I STAYED FOR
SOME TIME AT A PRIVATE HOTEL IN THE STRAND LEADING A COMFORTLESS
MEANINGLESS EXISTENCE AND SPENDING SUCH MONEY AS I HAD CONSIDERABLY
MORE FREELY THAN I OUGHT SO ALARMING DID THE STATE OF MY FINANCES
BECOME THAT I SOON REALIZED THAT I MUST EITHER LEAVE THE METROPOLIS
AND RUSTICATE SOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY OR THAT I MUST MAKE A
COMPLETE ALTERATION IN MY STYLE OF LIVING CHOOSING THE LATTER
ALTERNATIVE I BEGAN BY MAKING UP MY MIND TO LEAVE THE HOTEL AND TO
TAKE UP MY QUARTERS IN SOME LESS PRETENTIOUS AND LESS EXPENSIVE
DOMICILE
ON THE VERY DAY THAT I HAD COME TO THIS CONCLUSION I WAS STANDING AT
THE CRITERION BAR WHEN SOME ONE TAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AND
TURNING ROUND I RECOGNIZED YOUNG STAMFORD WHO HAD BEEN A DRESSER
UNDER ME AT BARTS THE SIGHT OF A FRIENDLY FACE IN THE GREAT
WILDERNESS OF LONDON IS A PLEASANT THING INDEED TO A LONELY MAN IN
OLD DAYS STAMFORD HAD NEVER BEEN A PARTICULAR CRONY OF MINE BUT NOW
I HAILED HIM WITH ENTHUSIASM AND HE IN HIS TURN APPEARED TO BE
DELIGHTED TO SEE ME IN THE EXUBERANCE OF MY JOY I ASKED HIM TO
LUNCH WITH ME AT THE HOLBORN AND WE STARTED OFF TOGETHER IN A
HANSOM
WHATEVER HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WITH YOURSELF WATSON HE ASKED IN
UNDISGUISED WONDER AS WE RATTLED THROUGH THE CROWDED LONDON STREETS
YOU ARE AS THIN AS A LATH AND AS BROWN AS A NUT
I GAVE HIM A SHORT SKETCH OF MY ADVENTURES AND HAD HARDLY CONCLUDED
IT BY THE TIME THAT WE REACHED OUR DESTINATION
POOR DEVIL HE SAID COMMISERATINGLY AFTER HE HAD LISTENED TO MY
MISFORTUNES WHAT ARE YOU UP TO NOW
LOOKING FOR LODGINGS I ANSWERED TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AS
TO WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET COMFORTABLE ROOMS AT A REASONABLE
PRICE
THATS A STRANGE THING REMARKED MY COMPANION YOU ARE THE SECOND
MAN TODAY THAT HAS USED THAT EXPRESSION TO ME
AND WHO WAS THE FIRST I ASKED
A FELLOW WHO IS WORKING AT THE CHEMICAL LABORATORY UP AT THE
HOSPITAL HE WAS BEMOANING HIMSELF THIS MORNING BECAUSE HE COULD NOT
GET SOMEONE TO GO HALVES WITH HIM IN SOME NICE ROOMS WHICH HE HAD
FOUND AND WHICH WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSE
BY JOVE I CRIED IF HE REALLY WANTS SOMEONE TO SHARE THE ROOMS
AND THE EXPENSE I AM THE VERY MAN FOR HIM I SHOULD PREFER HAVING A
PARTNER TO BEING ALONE
YOUNG STAMFORD LOOKED RATHER STRANGELY AT ME OVER HIS WINEGLASS
YOU DONT KNOW SHERLOCK HOLMES YET HE SAID PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT
CARE FOR HIM AS A CONSTANT COMPANION
WHY WHAT IS THERE AGAINST HIM
OH I DIDNT SAY THERE WAS ANYTHING AGAINST HIM HE IS A LITTLE
QUEER IN HIS IDEASAN ENTHUSIAST IN SOME BRANCHES OF SCIENCE AS FAR
AS I KNOW HE IS A DECENT FELLOW ENOUGH
A MEDICAL STUDENT I SUPPOSE SAID I
NOI HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE INTENDS TO GO IN FOR I BELIEVE HE IS
WELL UP IN ANATOMY AND HE IS A FIRSTCLASS CHEMIST BUT AS FAR AS I
KNOW HE HAS NEVER TAKEN OUT ANY SYSTEMATIC MEDICAL CLASSES HIS
STUDIES ARE VERY DESULTORY AND ECCENTRIC BUT HE HAS AMASSED A LOT OF
OUTOFTHE WAY KNOWLEDGE WHICH WOULD ASTONISH HIS PROFESSORS
DID YOU NEVER ASK HIM WHAT HE WAS GOING IN FOR I ASKED
NO HE IS NOT A MAN THAT IT IS EASY TO DRAW OUT THOUGH HE CAN BE
COMMUNICATIVE ENOUGH WHEN THE FANCY SEIZES HIM
I SHOULD LIKE TO MEET HIM I SAID IF I AM TO LODGE WITH ANYONE I
SHOULD PREFER A MAN OF STUDIOUS AND QUIET HABITS I AM NOT STRONG
ENOUGH YET TO STAND MUCH NOISE OR EXCITEMENT I HAD ENOUGH OF BOTH IN
AFGHANISTAN TO LAST ME FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY NATURAL EXISTENCE HOW
COULD I MEET THIS FRIEND OF YOURS
HE IS SURE TO BE AT THE LABORATORY RETURNED MY COMPANION HE
EITHER AVOIDS THE PLACE FOR WEEKS OR ELSE HE WORKS THERE FROM
MORNING TO NIGHT IF YOU LIKE WE SHALL DRIVE ROUND TOGETHER AFTER
LUNCHEON
CERTAINLY I ANSWERED AND THE CONVERSATION DRIFTED AWAY INTO OTHER
CHANNELS
AS WE MADE OUR WAY TO THE HOSPITAL AFTER LEAVING THE HOLBORN
STAMFORD GAVE ME A FEW MORE PARTICULARS ABOUT THE GENTLEMAN WHOM I
PROPOSED TO TAKE AS A FELLOWLODGER
YOU MUSTNT BLAME ME IF YOU DONT GET ON WITH HIM HE SAID I KNOW
NOTHING MORE OF HIM THAN I HAVE LEARNED FROM MEETING HIM OCCASIONALLY
IN THE LABORATORY YOU PROPOSED THIS ARRANGEMENT SO YOU MUST NOT
HOLD ME RESPONSIBLE
IF WE DONT GET ON IT WILL BE EASY TO PART COMPANY I ANSWERED IT
SEEMS TO ME STAMFORD I ADDED LOOKING HARD AT MY COMPANION THAT
YOU HAVE SOME REASON FOR WASHING YOUR HANDS OF THE MATTER IS THIS
FELLOWS TEMPER SO FORMIDABLE OR WHAT IS IT DONT BE MEALYMOUTHED
ABOUT IT
IT IS NOT EASY TO EXPRESS THE INEXPRESSIBLE HE ANSWERED WITH A
LAUGH HOLMES IS A LITTLE TOO SCIENTIFIC FOR MY TASTESIT
APPROACHES TO COLDBLOODEDNESS I COULD IMAGINE HIS GIVING A FRIEND A
LITTLE PINCH OF THE LATEST VEGETABLE ALKALOID NOT OUT OF
MALEVOLENCE YOU UNDERSTAND BUT SIMPLY OUT OF A SPIRIT OF INQUIRY IN
ORDER TO HAVE AN ACCURATE IDEA OF THE EFFECTS TO DO HIM JUSTICE I
THINK THAT HE WOULD TAKE IT HIMSELF WITH THE SAME READINESS HE
APPEARS TO HAVE A PASSION FOR DEFINITE AND EXACT KNOWLEDGE
VERY RIGHT TOO
YES BUT IT MAY BE PUSHED TO EXCESS WHEN IT COMES TO BEATING THE
SUBJECTS IN THE DISSECTINGROOMS WITH A STICK IT IS CERTAINLY TAKING
RATHER A BIZARRE SHAPE
BEATING THE SUBJECTS
YES TO VERIFY HOW FAR BRUISES MAY BE PRODUCED AFTER DEATH I SAW
HIM AT IT WITH MY OWN EYES
AND YET YOU SAY HE IS NOT A MEDICAL STUDENT
NO HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THE OBJECTS OF HIS STUDIES ARE BUT HERE WE
ARE AND YOU MUST FORM YOUR OWN IMPRESSIONS ABOUT HIM AS HE SPOKE
WE TURNED DOWN A NARROW LANE AND PASSED THROUGH A SMALL SIDEDOOR
WHICH OPENED INTO A WING OF THE GREAT HOSPITAL IT WAS FAMILIAR
GROUND TO ME AND I NEEDED NO GUIDING AS WE ASCENDED THE BLEAK STONE
STAIRCASE AND MADE OUR WAY DOWN THE LONG CORRIDOR WITH ITS VISTA OF
WHITEWASHED WALL AND DUNCOLOURED DOORS NEAR THE FURTHER END A LOW
ARCHED PASSAGE BRANCHED AWAY FROM IT AND LED TO THE CHEMICAL
LABORATORY
THIS WAS A LOFTY CHAMBER LINED AND LITTERED WITH COUNTLESS BOTTLES
BROAD LOW TABLES WERE SCATTERED ABOUT WHICH BRISTLED WITH RETORTS
TESTTUBES AND LITTLE BUNSEN LAMPS WITH THEIR BLUE FLICKERING
FLAMES THERE WAS ONLY ONE STUDENT IN THE ROOM WHO WAS BENDING OVER
A DISTANT TABLE ABSORBED IN HIS WORK AT THE SOUND OF OUR STEPS HE
GLANCED ROUND AND SPRANG TO HIS FEET WITH A CRY OF PLEASURE IVE
FOUND IT IVE FOUND IT HE SHOUTED TO MY COMPANION RUNNING TOWARDS
US WITH A TESTTUBE IN HIS HAND I HAVE FOUND A REAGENT WHICH IS
PRECIPITATED BY HOEMOGLOBIN AND BY NOTHING ELSE HAD HE DISCOVERED
A GOLD MINE GREATER DELIGHT COULD NOT HAVE SHONE UPON HIS FEATURES
DR WATSON MR SHERLOCK HOLMES SAID STAMFORD INTRODUCING US
HOW ARE YOU HE SAID CORDIALLY GRIPPING MY HAND WITH A STRENGTH
FOR WHICH I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE GIVEN HIM CREDIT YOU HAVE BEEN IN
AFGHANISTAN I PERCEIVE
HOW ON EARTH DID YOU KNOW THAT I ASKED IN ASTONISHMENT
NEVER MIND SAID HE CHUCKLING TO HIMSELF THE QUESTION NOW IS
ABOUT HOEMOGLOBIN NO DOUBT YOU SEE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS
DISCOVERY OF MINE
IT IS INTERESTING CHEMICALLY NO DOUBT I ANSWERED BUT
PRACTICALLY
WHY MAN IT IS THE MOST PRACTICAL MEDICOLEGAL DISCOVERY FOR YEARS
DONT YOU SEE THAT IT GIVES US AN INFALLIBLE TEST FOR BLOOD STAINS
COME OVER HERE NOW HE SEIZED ME BY THE COATSLEEVE IN HIS
EAGERNESS AND DREW ME OVER TO THE TABLE AT WHICH HE HAD BEEN
WORKING LET US HAVE SOME FRESH BLOOD HE SAID DIGGING A LONG
BODKIN INTO HIS FINGER AND DRAWING OFF THE RESULTING DROP OF BLOOD
IN A CHEMICAL PIPETTE NOW I ADD THIS SMALL QUANTITY OF BLOOD TO A
LITRE OF WATER YOU PERCEIVE THAT THE RESULTING MIXTURE HAS THE
APPEARANCE OF PURE WATER THE PROPORTION OF BLOOD CANNOT BE MORE THAN
ONE IN A MILLION I HAVE NO DOUBT HOWEVER THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO
OBTAIN THE CHARACTERISTIC REACTION AS HE SPOKE HE THREW INTO THE
VESSEL A FEW WHITE CRYSTALS AND THEN ADDED SOME DROPS OF A
TRANSPARENT FLUID IN AN INSTANT THE CONTENTS ASSUMED A DULL MAHOGANY
COLOUR AND A BROWNISH DUST WAS PRECIPITATED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE
GLASS JAR
HA HA HE CRIED CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND LOOKING AS DELIGHTED AS A
CHILD WITH A NEW TOY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT
IT SEEMS TO BE A VERY DELICATE TEST I REMARKED
BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL THE OLD GUIACUM TEST WAS VERY CLUMSY AND
UNCERTAIN SO IS THE MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION FOR BLOOD CORPUSCLES
THE LATTER IS VALUELESS IF THE STAINS ARE A FEW HOURS OLD NOW THIS
APPEARS TO ACT AS WELL WHETHER THE BLOOD IS OLD OR NEW HAD THIS TEST
BEEN INVENTED THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MEN NOW WALKING THE EARTH WHO
WOULD LONG AGO HAVE PAID THE PENALTY OF THEIR CRIMES
INDEED I MURMURED
CRIMINAL CASES ARE CONTINUALLY HINGING UPON THAT ONE POINT A MAN IS
SUSPECTED OF A CRIME MONTHS PERHAPS AFTER IT HAS BEEN COMMITTED HIS
LINEN OR CLOTHES ARE EXAMINED AND BROWNISH STAINS DISCOVERED UPON
THEM ARE THEY BLOOD STAINS OR MUD STAINS OR RUST STAINS OR FRUIT
STAINS OR WHAT ARE THEY THAT IS A QUESTION WHICH HAS PUZZLED MANY
AN EXPERT AND WHY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO RELIABLE TEST NOW WE HAVE
THE SHERLOCK HOLMES TEST AND THERE WILL NO LONGER BE ANY
DIFFICULTY
HIS EYES FAIRLY GLITTERED AS HE SPOKE AND HE PUT HIS HAND OVER HIS
HEART AND BOWED AS IF TO SOME APPLAUDING CROWD CONJURED UP BY HIS
IMAGINATION
YOU ARE TO BE CONGRATULATED I REMARKED CONSIDERABLY SURPRISED AT
HIS ENTHUSIASM
THERE WAS THE CASE OF VON BISCHOFF AT FRANKFORT LAST YEAR HE WOULD
CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN HUNG HAD THIS TEST BEEN IN EXISTENCE THEN THERE
WAS MASON OF BRADFORD AND THE NOTORIOUS MULLER AND LEFEVRE OF
MONTPELLIER AND SAMSON OF NEW ORLEANS I COULD NAME A SCORE OF CASES
IN WHICH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DECISIVE
YOU SEEM TO BE A WALKING CALENDAR OF CRIME SAID STAMFORD WITH A
LAUGH YOU MIGHT START A PAPER ON THOSE LINES CALL IT THE POLICE
NEWS OF THE PAST
VERY INTERESTING READING IT MIGHT BE MADE TOO REMARKED SHERLOCK
HOLMES STICKING A SMALL PIECE OF PLASTER OVER THE PRICK ON HIS
FINGER I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HE CONTINUED TURNING TO ME WITH A
SMILE FOR I DABBLE WITH POISONS A GOOD DEAL HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
AS HE SPOKE AND I NOTICED THAT IT WAS ALL MOTTLED OVER WITH SIMILAR
PIECES OF PLASTER AND DISCOLOURED WITH STRONG ACIDS
WE CAME HERE ON BUSINESS SAID STAMFORD SITTING DOWN ON A HIGH
THREELEGGED STOOL AND PUSHING ANOTHER ONE IN MY DIRECTION WITH HIS
FOOT MY FRIEND HERE WANTS TO TAKE DIGGINGS AND AS YOU WERE
COMPLAINING THAT YOU COULD GET NO ONE TO GO HALVES WITH YOU I
THOUGHT THAT I HAD BETTER BRING YOU TOGETHER
SHERLOCK HOLMES SEEMED DELIGHTED AT THE IDEA OF SHARING HIS ROOMS
WITH ME I HAVE MY EYE ON A SUITE IN BAKER STREET HE SAID WHICH
WOULD SUIT US DOWN TO THE GROUND YOU DONT MIND THE SMELL OF STRONG
TOBACCO I HOPE
I ALWAYS SMOKE SHIPS MYSELF I ANSWERED
THATS GOOD ENOUGH I GENERALLY HAVE CHEMICALS ABOUT AND
OCCASIONALLY DO EXPERIMENTS WOULD THAT ANNOY YOU
BY NO MEANS
LET ME SEEWHAT ARE MY OTHER SHORTCOMINGS I GET IN THE DUMPS AT
TIMES AND DONT OPEN MY MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END YOU MUST NOT THINK I
AM SULKY WHEN I DO THAT JUST LET ME ALONE AND ILL SOON BE RIGHT
WHAT HAVE YOU TO CONFESS NOW ITS JUST AS WELL FOR TWO FELLOWS TO
KNOW THE WORST OF ONE ANOTHER BEFORE THEY BEGIN TO LIVE TOGETHER
I LAUGHED AT THIS CROSSEXAMINATION I KEEP A BULL PUP I SAID
AND I OBJECT TO ROWS BECAUSE MY NERVES ARE SHAKEN AND I GET UP AT
ALL SORTS OF UNGODLY HOURS AND I AM EXTREMELY LAZY I HAVE ANOTHER
SET OF VICES WHEN IM WELL BUT THOSE ARE THE PRINCIPAL ONES AT
PRESENT
DO YOU INCLUDE VIOLINPLAYING IN YOUR CATEGORY OF ROWS HE ASKED
ANXIOUSLY
IT DEPENDS ON THE PLAYER I ANSWERED A WELLPLAYED VIOLIN IS A
TREAT FOR THE GODSA BADLYPLAYED ONE
OH THATS ALL RIGHT HE CRIED WITH A MERRY LAUGH I THINK WE MAY
CONSIDER THE THING AS SETTLEDTHAT IS IF THE ROOMS ARE AGREEABLE TO
YOU
WHEN SHALL WE SEE THEM
CALL FOR ME HERE AT NOON TOMORROW AND WELL GO TOGETHER AND SETTLE
EVERYTHING HE ANSWERED
ALL RIGHTNOON EXACTLY SAID I SHAKING HIS HAND
WE LEFT HIM WORKING AMONG HIS CHEMICALS AND WE WALKED TOGETHER
TOWARDS MY HOTEL
BY THE WAY I ASKED SUDDENLY STOPPING AND TURNING UPON STAMFORD
HOW THE DEUCE DID HE KNOW THAT I HAD COME FROM AFGHANISTAN
MY COMPANION SMILED AN ENIGMATICAL SMILE THATS JUST HIS LITTLE
PECULIARITY HE SAID A GOOD MANY PEOPLE HAVE WANTED TO KNOW HOW HE
FINDS THINGS OUT
OH A MYSTERY IS IT I CRIED RUBBING MY HANDS THIS IS VERY
PIQUANT I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER THE
PROPER STUDY OF MANKIND IS MAN YOU KNOW
YOU MUST STUDY HIM THEN STAMFORD SAID AS HE BADE ME GOODBYE
YOULL FIND HIM A KNOTTY PROBLEM THOUGH ILL WAGER HE LEARNS MORE
ABOUT YOU THAN YOU ABOUT HIM GOODBYE
GOODBYE I ANSWERED AND STROLLED ON TO MY HOTEL CONSIDERABLY
INTERESTED IN MY NEW ACQUAINTANCE
CHAPTER II
THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION
WE MET NEXT DAY AS HE HAD ARRANGED AND INSPECTED THE ROOMS AT NO
B BAKER STREET OF WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN AT OUR MEETING THEY
CONSISTED OF A COUPLE OF COMFORTABLE BEDROOMS AND A SINGLE LARGE
AIRY SITTINGROOM CHEERFULLY FURNISHED AND ILLUMINATED BY TWO BROAD
WINDOWS SO DESIRABLE IN EVERY WAY WERE THE APARTMENTS AND SO
MODERATE DID THE TERMS SEEM WHEN DIVIDED BETWEEN US THAT THE BARGAIN
WAS CONCLUDED UPON THE SPOT AND WE AT ONCE ENTERED INTO POSSESSION
THAT VERY EVENING I MOVED MY THINGS ROUND FROM THE HOTEL AND ON THE
FOLLOWING MORNING SHERLOCK HOLMES FOLLOWED ME WITH SEVERAL BOXES AND
PORTMANTEAUS FOR A DAY OR TWO WE WERE BUSILY EMPLOYED IN UNPACKING
AND LAYING OUT OUR PROPERTY TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE THAT DONE WE
GRADUALLY BEGAN TO SETTLE DOWN AND TO ACCOMMODATE OURSELVES TO OUR
NEW SURROUNDINGS
HOLMES WAS CERTAINLY NOT A DIFFICULT MAN TO LIVE WITH HE WAS QUIET
IN HIS WAYS AND HIS HABITS WERE REGULAR IT WAS RARE FOR HIM TO BE
UP AFTER TEN AT NIGHT AND HE HAD INVARIABLY BREAKFASTED AND GONE OUT
BEFORE I ROSE IN THE MORNING SOMETIMES HE SPENT HIS DAY AT THE
CHEMICAL LABORATORY SOMETIMES IN THE DISSECTINGROOMS AND
OCCASIONALLY IN LONG WALKS WHICH APPEARED TO TAKE HIM INTO THE
LOWEST PORTIONS OF THE CITY NOTHING COULD EXCEED HIS ENERGY WHEN THE
WORKING FIT WAS UPON HIM BUT NOW AND AGAIN A REACTION WOULD SEIZE
HIM AND FOR DAYS ON END HE WOULD LIE UPON THE SOFA IN THE
SITTINGROOM HARDLY UTTERING A WORD OR MOVING A MUSCLE FROM MORNING
TO NIGHT ON THESE OCCASIONS I HAVE NOTICED SUCH A DREAMY VACANT
EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES THAT I MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED HIM OF BEING
ADDICTED TO THE USE OF SOME NARCOTIC HAD NOT THE TEMPERANCE AND
CLEANLINESS OF HIS WHOLE LIFE FORBIDDEN SUCH A NOTION
AS THE WEEKS WENT BY MY INTEREST IN HIM AND MY CURIOSITY AS TO HIS
AIMS IN LIFE GRADUALLY DEEPENED AND INCREASED HIS VERY PERSON AND
APPEARANCE WERE SUCH AS TO STRIKE THE ATTENTION OF THE MOST CASUAL
OBSERVER IN HEIGHT HE WAS RATHER OVER SIX FEET AND SO EXCESSIVELY
LEAN THAT HE SEEMED TO BE CONSIDERABLY TALLER HIS EYES WERE SHARP
AND PIERCING SAVE DURING THOSE INTERVALS OF TORPOR TO WHICH I HAVE
ALLUDED AND HIS THIN HAWKLIKE NOSE GAVE HIS WHOLE EXPRESSION AN
AIR OF ALERTNESS AND DECISION HIS CHIN TOO HAD THE PROMINENCE AND
SQUARENESS WHICH MARK THE MAN OF DETERMINATION HIS HANDS WERE
INVARIABLY BLOTTED WITH INK AND STAINED WITH CHEMICALS YET HE WAS
POSSESSED OF EXTRAORDINARY DELICACY OF TOUCH AS I FREQUENTLY HAD
OCCASION TO OBSERVE WHEN I WATCHED HIM MANIPULATING HIS FRAGILE
PHILOSOPHICAL INSTRUMENTS
THE READER MAY SET ME DOWN AS A HOPELESS BUSYBODY WHEN I CONFESS HOW
MUCH THIS MAN STIMULATED MY CURIOSITY AND HOW OFTEN I ENDEAVOURED TO
BREAK THROUGH THE RETICENCE WHICH HE SHOWED ON ALL THAT CONCERNED
HIMSELF BEFORE PRONOUNCING JUDGMENT HOWEVER BE IT REMEMBERED HOW
OBJECTLESS WAS MY LIFE AND HOW LITTLE THERE WAS TO ENGAGE MY
ATTENTION MY HEALTH FORBADE ME FROM VENTURING OUT UNLESS THE WEATHER
WAS EXCEPTIONALLY GENIAL AND I HAD NO FRIENDS WHO WOULD CALL UPON ME
AND BREAK THE MONOTONY OF MY DAILY EXISTENCE UNDER THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES I EAGERLY HAILED THE LITTLE MYSTERY WHICH HUNG AROUND
MY COMPANION AND SPENT MUCH OF MY TIME IN ENDEAVOURING TO UNRAVEL
IT
HE WAS NOT STUDYING MEDICINE HE HAD HIMSELF IN REPLY TO A QUESTION
CONFIRMED STAMFORDS OPINION UPON THAT POINT NEITHER DID HE APPEAR
TO HAVE PURSUED ANY COURSE OF READING WHICH MIGHT FIT HIM FOR A
DEGREE IN SCIENCE OR ANY OTHER RECOGNIZED PORTAL WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM
AN ENTRANCE INTO THE LEARNED WORLD YET HIS ZEAL FOR CERTAIN STUDIES
WAS REMARKABLE AND WITHIN ECCENTRIC LIMITS HIS KNOWLEDGE WAS SO
EXTRAORDINARILY AMPLE AND MINUTE THAT HIS OBSERVATIONS HAVE FAIRLY
ASTOUNDED ME SURELY NO MAN WOULD WORK SO HARD OR ATTAIN SUCH PRECISE
INFORMATION UNLESS HE HAD SOME DEFINITE END IN VIEW DESULTORY
READERS ARE SELDOM REMARKABLE FOR THE EXACTNESS OF THEIR LEARNING NO
MAN BURDENS HIS MIND WITH SMALL MATTERS UNLESS HE HAS SOME VERY GOOD
REASON FOR DOING SO
HIS IGNORANCE WAS AS REMARKABLE AS HIS KNOWLEDGE OF CONTEMPORARY
LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS HE APPEARED TO KNOW NEXT TO
NOTHING UPON MY QUOTING THOMAS CARLYLE HE INQUIRED IN THE NAIVEST
WAY WHO HE MIGHT BE AND WHAT HE HAD DONE MY SURPRISE REACHED A
CLIMAX HOWEVER WHEN I FOUND INCIDENTALLY THAT HE WAS IGNORANT OF
THE COPERNICAN THEORY AND OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
THAT ANY CIVILIZED HUMAN BEING IN THIS NINETEENTH CENTURY SHOULD NOT
BE AWARE THAT THE EARTH TRAVELLED ROUND THE SUN APPEARED TO BE TO ME
SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY FACT THAT I COULD HARDLY REALIZE IT
YOU APPEAR TO BE ASTONISHED HE SAID SMILING AT MY EXPRESSION OF
SURPRISE NOW THAT I DO KNOW IT I SHALL DO MY BEST TO FORGET IT
TO FORGET IT
YOU SEE HE EXPLAINED I CONSIDER THAT A MANS BRAIN ORIGINALLY IS
LIKE A LITTLE EMPTY ATTIC AND YOU HAVE TO STOCK IT WITH SUCH
FURNITURE AS YOU CHOOSE A FOOL TAKES IN ALL THE LUMBER OF EVERY SORT
THAT HE COMES ACROSS SO THAT THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH MIGHT BE USEFUL TO
HIM GETS CROWDED OUT OR AT BEST IS JUMBLED UP WITH A LOT OF OTHER
THINGS SO THAT HE HAS A DIFFICULTY IN LAYING HIS HANDS UPON IT NOW
THE SKILFUL WORKMAN IS VERY CAREFUL INDEED AS TO WHAT HE TAKES INTO
HIS BRAINATTIC HE WILL HAVE NOTHING BUT THE TOOLS WHICH MAY HELP
HIM IN DOING HIS WORK BUT OF THESE HE HAS A LARGE ASSORTMENT AND
ALL IN THE MOST PERFECT ORDER IT IS A MISTAKE TO THINK THAT THAT
LITTLE ROOM HAS ELASTIC WALLS AND CAN DISTEND TO ANY EXTENT DEPEND
UPON IT THERE COMES A TIME WHEN FOR EVERY ADDITION OF KNOWLEDGE YOU
FORGET SOMETHING THAT YOU KNEW BEFORE IT IS OF THE HIGHEST
IMPORTANCE THEREFORE NOT TO HAVE USELESS FACTS ELBOWING OUT THE
USEFUL ONES
BUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM I PROTESTED
WHAT THE DEUCE IS IT TO ME HE INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY YOU SAY
THAT WE GO ROUND THE SUN IF WE WENT ROUND THE MOON IT WOULD NOT MAKE
A PENNYWORTH OF DIFFERENCE TO ME OR TO MY WORK
I WAS ON THE POINT OF ASKING HIM WHAT THAT WORK MIGHT BE BUT
SOMETHING IN HIS MANNER SHOWED ME THAT THE QUESTION WOULD BE AN
UNWELCOME ONE I PONDERED OVER OUR SHORT CONVERSATION HOWEVER AND
ENDEAVOURED TO DRAW MY DEDUCTIONS FROM IT HE SAID THAT HE WOULD
ACQUIRE NO KNOWLEDGE WHICH DID NOT BEAR UPON HIS OBJECT THEREFORE
ALL THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH HE POSSESSED WAS SUCH AS WOULD BE USEFUL TO
HIM I ENUMERATED IN MY OWN MIND ALL THE VARIOUS POINTS UPON WHICH HE
HAD SHOWN ME THAT HE WAS EXCEPTIONALLY WELLINFORMED I EVEN TOOK A
PENCIL AND JOTTED THEM DOWN I COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE DOCUMENT
WHEN I HAD COMPLETED IT IT RAN IN THIS WAY

SENSATIONAL LITERATUREIMMENSE HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL
OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY
PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL
IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER BOXER AND SWORDSMAN
HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW
WHEN I HAD GOT SO FAR IN MY LIST I THREW IT INTO THE FIRE IN DESPAIR
IF I CAN ONLY FIND WHAT THE FELLOW IS DRIVING AT BY RECONCILING ALL
THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND DISCOVERING A CALLING WHICH NEEDS THEM
ALL I SAID TO MYSELF I MAY AS WELL GIVE UP THE ATTEMPT AT ONCE
I SEE THAT I HAVE ALLUDED ABOVE TO HIS POWERS UPON THE VIOLIN THESE
WERE VERY REMARKABLE BUT AS ECCENTRIC AS ALL HIS OTHER
ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT HE COULD PLAY PIECES AND DIFFICULT PIECES I
KNEW WELL BECAUSE AT MY REQUEST HE HAS PLAYED ME SOME OF
MENDELSSOHNS LIEDER AND OTHER FAVOURITES WHEN LEFT TO HIMSELF
HOWEVER HE WOULD SELDOM PRODUCE ANY MUSIC OR ATTEMPT ANY RECOGNIZED
AIR LEANING BACK IN HIS ARMCHAIR OF AN EVENING HE WOULD CLOSE HIS
EYES AND SCRAPE CARELESSLY AT THE FIDDLE WHICH WAS THROWN ACROSS HIS
KNEE SOMETIMES THE CHORDS WERE SONOROUS AND MELANCHOLY OCCASIONALLY
THEY WERE FANTASTIC AND CHEERFUL CLEARLY THEY REFLECTED THE THOUGHTS
WHICH POSSESSED HIM BUT WHETHER THE MUSIC AIDED THOSE THOUGHTS OR
WHETHER THE PLAYING WAS SIMPLY THE RESULT OF A WHIM OR FANCY WAS MORE
THAN I COULD DETERMINE I MIGHT HAVE REBELLED AGAINST THESE
EXASPERATING SOLOS HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT HE USUALLY TERMINATED THEM BY
PLAYING IN QUICK SUCCESSION A WHOLE SERIES OF MY FAVOURITE AIRS AS A
SLIGHT COMPENSATION FOR THE TRIAL UPON MY PATIENCE
DURING THE FIRST WEEK OR SO WE HAD NO CALLERS AND I HAD BEGUN TO
THINK THAT MY COMPANION WAS AS FRIENDLESS A MAN AS I WAS MYSELF
PRESENTLY HOWEVER I FOUND THAT HE HAD MANY ACQUAINTANCES AND THOSE
IN THE MOST DIFFERENT CLASSES OF SOCIETY THERE WAS ONE LITTLE SALLOW
RATFACED DARKEYED FELLOW WHO WAS INTRODUCED TO ME AS MR LESTRADE
AND WHO CAME THREE OR FOUR TIMES IN A SINGLE WEEK ONE MORNING A
YOUNG GIRL CALLED FASHIONABLY DRESSED AND STAYED FOR HALF AN HOUR
OR MORE THE SAME AFTERNOON BROUGHT A GREYHEADED SEEDY VISITOR
LOOKING LIKE A JEW PEDLAR WHO APPEARED TO ME TO BE MUCH EXCITED AND
WHO WAS CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY A SLIPSHOD ELDERLY WOMAN ON ANOTHER
OCCASION AN OLD WHITEHAIRED GENTLEMAN HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH MY
COMPANION AND ON ANOTHER A RAILWAY PORTER IN HIS VELVETEEN UNIFORM
WHEN ANY OF THESE NONDESCRIPT INDIVIDUALS PUT IN AN APPEARANCE
SHERLOCK HOLMES USED TO BEG FOR THE USE OF THE SITTINGROOM AND I
WOULD RETIRE TO MY BEDROOM HE ALWAYS APOLOGIZED TO ME FOR PUTTING
ME TO THIS INCONVENIENCE I HAVE TO USE THIS ROOM AS A PLACE OF
BUSINESS HE SAID AND THESE PEOPLE ARE MY CLIENTS AGAIN I HAD AN
OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING HIM A POINT BLANK QUESTION AND AGAIN MY
DELICACY PREVENTED ME FROM FORCING ANOTHER MAN TO CONFIDE IN ME I
IMAGINED AT THE TIME THAT HE HAD SOME STRONG REASON FOR NOT ALLUDING
TO IT BUT HE SOON DISPELLED THE IDEA BY COMING ROUND TO THE SUBJECT
OF HIS OWN ACCORD
IT WAS UPON THE TH OF MARCH AS I HAVE GOOD REASON TO REMEMBER THAT
I ROSE SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN USUAL AND FOUND THAT SHERLOCK HOLMES
HAD NOT YET FINISHED HIS BREAKFAST THE LANDLADY HAD BECOME SO
ACCUSTOMED TO MY LATE HABITS THAT MY PLACE HAD NOT BEEN LAID NOR MY
COFFEE PREPARED WITH THE UNREASONABLE PETULANCE OF MANKIND I RANG
THE BELL AND GAVE A CURT INTIMATION THAT I WAS READY THEN I PICKED
UP A MAGAZINE FROM THE TABLE AND ATTEMPTED TO WHILE AWAY THE TIME
WITH IT WHILE MY COMPANION MUNCHED SILENTLY AT HIS TOAST ONE OF THE
ARTICLES HAD A PENCIL MARK AT THE HEADING AND I NATURALLY BEGAN TO
RUN MY EYE THROUGH IT
ITS SOMEWHAT AMBITIOUS TITLE WAS THE BOOK OF LIFE AND IT ATTEMPTED
TO SHOW HOW MUCH AN OBSERVANT MAN MIGHT LEARN BY AN ACCURATE AND
SYSTEMATIC EXAMINATION OF ALL THAT CAME IN HIS WAY IT STRUCK ME AS
BEING A REMARKABLE MIXTURE OF SHREWDNESS AND OF ABSURDITY THE
REASONING WAS CLOSE AND INTENSE BUT THE DEDUCTIONS APPEARED TO ME TO
BE FARFETCHED AND EXAGGERATED THE WRITER CLAIMED BY A MOMENTARY
EXPRESSION A TWITCH OF A MUSCLE OR A GLANCE OF AN EYE TO FATHOM A
MANS INMOST THOUGHTS DECEIT ACCORDING TO HIM WAS AN IMPOSSIBILITY
IN THE CASE OF ONE TRAINED TO OBSERVATION AND ANALYSIS HIS
CONCLUSIONS WERE AS INFALLIBLE AS SO MANY PROPOSITIONS OF EUCLID SO
STARTLING WOULD HIS RESULTS APPEAR TO THE UNINITIATED THAT UNTIL THEY
LEARNED THE PROCESSES BY WHICH HE HAD ARRIVED AT THEM THEY MIGHT WELL
CONSIDER HIM AS A NECROMANCER
FROM A DROP OF WATER SAID THE WRITER A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE
POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD
OF ONE OR THE OTHER SO ALL LIFE IS A GREAT CHAIN THE NATURE OF
WHICH IS KNOWN WHENEVER WE ARE SHOWN A SINGLE LINK OF IT LIKE ALL
OTHER ARTS THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION AND ANALYSIS IS ONE WHICH CAN
ONLY BE ACQUIRED BY LONG AND PATIENT STUDY NOR IS LIFE LONG ENOUGH TO
ALLOW ANY MORTAL TO ATTAIN THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE PERFECTION IN IT
BEFORE TURNING TO THOSE MORAL AND MENTAL ASPECTS OF THE MATTER WHICH
PRESENT THE GREATEST DIFFICULTIES LET THE ENQUIRER BEGIN BY
MASTERING MORE ELEMENTARY PROBLEMS LET HIM ON MEETING A
FELLOWMORTAL LEARN AT A GLANCE TO DISTINGUISH THE HISTORY OF THE
MAN AND THE TRADE OR PROFESSION TO WHICH HE BELONGS PUERILE AS SUCH
AN EXERCISE MAY SEEM IT SHARPENS THE FACULTIES OF OBSERVATION AND
TEACHES ONE WHERE TO LOOK AND WHAT TO LOOK FOR BY A MANS FINGER
NAILS BY HIS COATSLEEVE BY HIS BOOT BY HIS TROUSER KNEES BY THE
CALLOSITIES OF HIS FOREFINGER AND THUMB BY HIS EXPRESSION BY HIS
SHIRT CUFFSBY EACH OF THESE THINGS A MANS CALLING IS PLAINLY
REVEALED THAT ALL UNITED SHOULD FAIL TO ENLIGHTEN THE COMPETENT
ENQUIRER IN ANY CASE IS ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE
WHAT INEFFABLE TWADDLE I CRIED SLAPPING THE MAGAZINE DOWN ON THE
TABLE I NEVER READ SUCH RUBBISH IN MY LIFE
WHAT IS IT ASKED SHERLOCK HOLMES
WHY THIS ARTICLE I SAID POINTING AT IT WITH MY EGG SPOON AS I
SAT DOWN TO MY BREAKFAST I SEE THAT YOU HAVE READ IT SINCE YOU HAVE
MARKED IT I DONT DENY THAT IT IS SMARTLY WRITTEN IT IRRITATES ME
THOUGH IT IS EVIDENTLY THE THEORY OF SOME ARMCHAIR LOUNGER WHO
EVOLVES ALL THESE NEAT LITTLE PARADOXES IN THE SECLUSION OF HIS OWN
STUDY IT IS NOT PRACTICAL I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM CLAPPED DOWN IN
A THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE ON THE UNDERGROUND AND ASKED TO GIVE THE
TRADES OF ALL HIS FELLOWTRAVELLERS I WOULD LAY A THOUSAND TO ONE
AGAINST HIM
YOU WOULD LOSE YOUR MONEY SHERLOCK HOLMES REMARKED CALMLY AS
FOR THE ARTICLE I WROTE IT MYSELF
YOU
YES I HAVE A TURN BOTH FOR OBSERVATION AND FOR DEDUCTION THE
THEORIES WHICH I HAVE EXPRESSED THERE AND WHICH APPEAR TO YOU TO BE
SO CHIMERICAL ARE REALLY EXTREMELY PRACTICALSO PRACTICAL THAT I
DEPEND UPON THEM FOR MY BREAD AND CHEESE
AND HOW I ASKED INVOLUNTARILY
WELL I HAVE A TRADE OF MY OWN I SUPPOSE I AM THE ONLY ONE IN THE
WORLD IM A CONSULTING DETECTIVE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT
IS HERE IN LONDON WE HAVE LOTS OF GOVERNMENT DETECTIVES AND LOTS OF
PRIVATE ONES WHEN THESE FELLOWS ARE AT FAULT THEY COME TO ME AND I
MANAGE TO PUT THEM ON THE RIGHT SCENT THEY LAY ALL THE EVIDENCE
BEFORE ME AND I AM GENERALLY ABLE BY THE HELP OF MY KNOWLEDGE OF
THE HISTORY OF CRIME TO SET THEM STRAIGHT THERE IS A STRONG FAMILY
RESEMBLANCE ABOUT MISDEEDS AND IF YOU HAVE ALL THE DETAILS OF A
THOUSAND AT YOUR FINGER ENDS IT IS ODD IF YOU CANT UNRAVEL THE
THOUSAND AND FIRST LESTRADE IS A WELLKNOWN DETECTIVE HE GOT
HIMSELF INTO A FOG RECENTLY OVER A FORGERY CASE AND THAT WAS WHAT
BROUGHT HIM HERE
AND THESE OTHER PEOPLE
THEY ARE MOSTLY SENT ON BY PRIVATE INQUIRY AGENCIES THEY ARE ALL
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN TROUBLE ABOUT SOMETHING AND WANT A LITTLE
ENLIGHTENING I LISTEN TO THEIR STORY THEY LISTEN TO MY COMMENTS
AND THEN I POCKET MY FEE
BUT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY I SAID THAT WITHOUT LEAVING YOUR ROOM YOU
CAN UNRAVEL SOME KNOT WHICH OTHER MEN CAN MAKE NOTHING OF ALTHOUGH
THEY HAVE SEEN EVERY DETAIL FOR THEMSELVES
QUITE SO I HAVE A KIND OF INTUITION THAT WAY NOW AND AGAIN A CASE
TURNS UP WHICH IS A LITTLE MORE COMPLEX THEN I HAVE TO BUSTLE ABOUT
AND SEE THINGS WITH MY OWN EYES YOU SEE I HAVE A LOT OF SPECIAL
KNOWLEDGE WHICH I APPLY TO THE PROBLEM AND WHICH FACILITATES MATTERS
WONDERFULLY THOSE RULES OF DEDUCTION LAID DOWN IN THAT ARTICLE WHICH
AROUSED YOUR SCORN ARE INVALUABLE TO ME IN PRACTICAL WORK
OBSERVATION WITH ME IS SECOND NATURE YOU APPEARED TO BE SURPRISED
WHEN I TOLD YOU ON OUR FIRST MEETING THAT YOU HAD COME FROM
AFGHANISTAN
YOU WERE TOLD NO DOUBT
NOTHING OF THE SORT I KNEW YOU CAME FROM AFGHANISTAN FROM LONG
HABIT THE TRAIN OF THOUGHTS RAN SO SWIFTLY THROUGH MY MIND THAT I
ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF INTERMEDIATE
STEPS THERE WERE SUCH STEPS HOWEVER THE TRAIN OF REASONING RAN
HERE IS A GENTLEMAN OF A MEDICAL TYPE BUT WITH THE AIR OF A
MILITARY MAN CLEARLY AN ARMY DOCTOR THEN HE HAS JUST COME FROM THE
TROPICS FOR HIS FACE IS DARK AND THAT IS NOT THE NATURAL TINT OF
HIS SKIN FOR HIS WRISTS ARE FAIR HE HAS UNDERGONE HARDSHIP AND
SICKNESS AS HIS HAGGARD FACE SAYS CLEARLY HIS LEFT ARM HAS BEEN
INJURED HE HOLDS IT IN A STIFF AND UNNATURAL MANNER WHERE IN THE
TROPICS COULD AN ENGLISH ARMY DOCTOR HAVE SEEN MUCH HARDSHIP AND GOT
HIS ARM WOUNDED CLEARLY IN AFGHANISTAN THE WHOLE TRAIN OF THOUGHT
DID NOT OCCUPY A SECOND I THEN REMARKED THAT YOU CAME FROM
AFGHANISTAN AND YOU WERE ASTONISHED
IT IS SIMPLE ENOUGH AS YOU EXPLAIN IT I SAID SMILING YOU REMIND
ME OF EDGAR ALLEN POES DUPIN I HAD NO IDEA THAT SUCH INDIVIDUALS
DID EXIST OUTSIDE OF STORIES
SHERLOCK HOLMES ROSE AND LIT HIS PIPE NO DOUBT YOU THINK THAT YOU
ARE COMPLIMENTING ME IN COMPARING ME TO DUPIN HE OBSERVED NOW IN
MY OPINION DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW THAT TRICK OF HIS OF
BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIENDS THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK AFTER A
QUARTER OF AN HOURS SILENCE IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL HE
HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS NO DOUBT BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A
PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARED TO IMAGINE
HAVE YOU READ GABORIAUS WORKS I ASKED DOES LECOQ COME UP TO
YOUR IDEA OF A DETECTIVE
SHERLOCK HOLMES SNIFFED SARDONICALLY LECOQ WAS A MISERABLE
BUNGLER HE SAID IN AN ANGRY VOICE HE HAD ONLY ONE THING TO
RECOMMEND HIM AND THAT WAS HIS ENERGY THAT BOOK MADE ME POSITIVELY
ILL THE QUESTION WAS HOW TO IDENTIFY AN UNKNOWN PRISONER I COULD
HAVE DONE IT IN TWENTYFOUR HOURS LECOQ TOOK SIX MONTHS OR SO IT
MIGHT BE MADE A TEXTBOOK FOR DETECTIVES TO TEACH THEM WHAT TO
AVOID
I FELT RATHER INDIGNANT AT HAVING TWO CHARACTERS WHOM I HAD ADMIRED
TREATED IN THIS CAVALIER STYLE I WALKED OVER TO THE WINDOW AND
STOOD LOOKING OUT INTO THE BUSY STREET THIS FELLOW MAY BE VERY
CLEVER I SAID TO MYSELF BUT HE IS CERTAINLY VERY CONCEITED
THERE ARE NO CRIMES AND NO CRIMINALS IN THESE DAYS HE SAID
QUERULOUSLY WHAT IS THE USE OF HAVING BRAINS IN OUR PROFESSION I
KNOW WELL THAT I HAVE IT IN ME TO MAKE MY NAME FAMOUS NO MAN LIVES
OR HAS EVER LIVED WHO HAS BROUGHT THE SAME AMOUNT OF STUDY AND OF
NATURAL TALENT TO THE DETECTION OF CRIME WHICH I HAVE DONE AND WHAT
IS THE RESULT THERE IS NO CRIME TO DETECT OR AT MOST SOME
BUNGLING VILLANY WITH A MOTIVE SO TRANSPARENT THAT EVEN A SCOTLAND
YARD OFFICIAL CAN SEE THROUGH IT
I WAS STILL ANNOYED AT HIS BUMPTIOUS STYLE OF CONVERSATION I THOUGHT
IT BEST TO CHANGE THE TOPIC
I WONDER WHAT THAT FELLOW IS LOOKING FOR I ASKED POINTING TO A
STALWART PLAINLYDRESSED INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS WALKING SLOWLY DOWN THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET LOOKING ANXIOUSLY AT THE NUMBERS HE HAD A
LARGE BLUE ENVELOPE IN HIS HAND AND WAS EVIDENTLY THE BEARER OF A
MESSAGE
YOU MEAN THE RETIRED SERGEANT OF MARINES SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
BRAG AND BOUNCE THOUGHT I TO MYSELF HE KNOWS THAT I CANNOT
VERIFY HIS GUESS
THE THOUGHT HAD HARDLY PASSED THROUGH MY MIND WHEN THE MAN WHOM WE
WERE WATCHING CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE NUMBER ON OUR DOOR AND RAN RAPIDLY
ACROSS THE ROADWAY WE HEARD A LOUD KNOCK A DEEP VOICE BELOW AND
HEAVY STEPS ASCENDING THE STAIR
FOR MR SHERLOCK HOLMES HE SAID STEPPING INTO THE ROOM AND
HANDING MY FRIEND THE LETTER
HERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING THE CONCEIT OUT OF HIM HE LITTLE
THOUGHT OF THIS WHEN HE MADE THAT RANDOM SHOT MAY I ASK MY LAD I
SAID IN THE BLANDEST VOICE WHAT YOUR TRADE MAY BE
COMMISSIONAIRE SIR HE SAID GRUFFLY UNIFORM AWAY FOR REPAIRS
AND YOU WERE I ASKED WITH A SLIGHTLY MALICIOUS GLANCE AT MY
COMPANION
A SERGEANT SIR ROYAL MARINE LIGHT INFANTRY SIR NO ANSWER RIGHT
SIR
HE CLICKED HIS HEELS TOGETHER RAISED HIS HAND IN A SALUTE AND WAS
GONE
CHAPTER III
THE LAURISTON GARDEN MYSTERY
I CONFESS THAT I WAS CONSIDERABLY STARTLED BY THIS FRESH PROOF OF THE
PRACTICAL NATURE OF MY COMPANIONS THEORIES MY RESPECT FOR HIS
POWERS OF ANALYSIS INCREASED WONDROUSLY THERE STILL REMAINED SOME
LURKING SUSPICION IN MY MIND HOWEVER THAT THE WHOLE THING WAS A
PREARRANGED EPISODE INTENDED TO DAZZLE ME THOUGH WHAT EARTHLY
OBJECT HE COULD HAVE IN TAKING ME IN WAS PAST MY COMPREHENSION WHEN
I LOOKED AT HIM HE HAD FINISHED READING THE NOTE AND HIS EYES HAD
ASSUMED THE VACANT LACKLUSTRE EXPRESSION WHICH SHOWED MENTAL
ABSTRACTION
HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU DEDUCE THAT I ASKED
DEDUCE WHAT SAID HE PETULANTLY
WHY THAT HE WAS A RETIRED SERGEANT OF MARINES
I HAVE NO TIME FOR TRIFLES HE ANSWERED BRUSQUELY THEN WITH A
SMILE EXCUSE MY RUDENESS YOU BROKE THE THREAD OF MY THOUGHTS BUT
PERHAPS IT IS AS WELL SO YOU ACTUALLY WERE NOT ABLE TO SEE THAT THAT
MAN WAS A SERGEANT OF MARINES
NO INDEED
IT WAS EASIER TO KNOW IT THAN TO EXPLAIN WHY I KNEW IT IF YOU WERE
ASKED TO PROVE THAT TWO AND TWO MADE FOUR YOU MIGHT FIND SOME
DIFFICULTY AND YET YOU ARE QUITE SURE OF THE FACT EVEN ACROSS THE
STREET I COULD SEE A GREAT BLUE ANCHOR TATTOOED ON THE BACK OF THE
FELLOWS HAND THAT SMACKED OF THE SEA HE HAD A MILITARY CARRIAGE
HOWEVER AND REGULATION SIDE WHISKERS THERE WE HAVE THE MARINE HE
WAS A MAN WITH SOME AMOUNT OF SELFIMPORTANCE AND A CERTAIN AIR OF
COMMAND YOU MUST HAVE OBSERVED THE WAY IN WHICH HE HELD HIS HEAD AND
SWUNG HIS CANE A STEADY RESPECTABLE MIDDLEAGED MAN TOO ON THE
FACE OF HIMALL FACTS WHICH LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAD BEEN A
SERGEANT
WONDERFUL I EJACULATED
COMMONPLACE SAID HOLMES THOUGH I THOUGHT FROM HIS EXPRESSION THAT
HE WAS PLEASED AT MY EVIDENT SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION I SAID JUST
NOW THAT THERE WERE NO CRIMINALS IT APPEARS THAT I AM WRONGLOOK AT
THIS HE THREW ME OVER THE NOTE WHICH THE COMMISSIONAIRE HAD
BROUGHT
WHY I CRIED AS I CAST MY EYE OVER IT THIS IS TERRIBLE
IT DOES SEEM TO BE A LITTLE OUT OF THE COMMON HE REMARKED CALMLY
WOULD YOU MIND READING IT TO ME ALOUD
THIS IS THE LETTER WHICH I READ TO HIM
MY DEAR MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
THERE HAS BEEN A BAD BUSINESS DURING THE NIGHT AT LAURISTON
GARDENS OFF THE BRIXTON ROAD OUR MAN ON THE BEAT SAW A LIGHT THERE
ABOUT TWO IN THE MORNING AND AS THE HOUSE WAS AN EMPTY ONE
SUSPECTED THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS HE FOUND THE DOOR OPEN AND IN
THE FRONT ROOM WHICH IS BARE OF FURNITURE DISCOVERED THE BODY OF A
GENTLEMAN WELL DRESSED AND HAVING CARDS IN HIS POCKET BEARING THE
NAME OF ENOCH J DREBBER CLEVELAND OHIO USA THERE HAD BEEN NO
ROBBERY NOR IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE AS TO HOW THE MAN MET HIS DEATH
THERE ARE MARKS OF BLOOD IN THE ROOM BUT THERE IS NO WOUND UPON HIS
PERSON WE ARE AT A LOSS AS TO HOW HE CAME INTO THE EMPTY HOUSE
INDEED THE WHOLE AFFAIR IS A PUZZLER IF YOU CAN COME ROUND TO THE
HOUSE ANY TIME BEFORE TWELVE YOU WILL FIND ME THERE I HAVE LEFT
EVERYTHING IN STATU QUO UNTIL I HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO
COME I SHALL GIVE YOU FULLER DETAILS AND WOULD ESTEEM IT A GREAT
KINDNESS IF YOU WOULD FAVOUR ME WITH YOUR OPINION
YOURS FAITHFULLY
TOBIAS GREGSON
GREGSON IS THE SMARTEST OF THE SCOTLAND YARDERS MY FRIEND
REMARKED HE AND LESTRADE ARE THE PICK OF A BAD LOT THEY ARE BOTH
QUICK AND ENERGETIC BUT CONVENTIONALSHOCKINGLY SO THEY HAVE THEIR
KNIVES INTO ONE ANOTHER TOO THEY ARE AS JEALOUS AS A PAIR OF
PROFESSIONAL BEAUTIES THERE WILL BE SOME FUN OVER THIS CASE IF THEY
ARE BOTH PUT UPON THE SCENT
I WAS AMAZED AT THE CALM WAY IN WHICH HE RIPPLED ON SURELY THERE IS
NOT A MOMENT TO BE LOST I CRIED SHALL I GO AND ORDER YOU A CAB
IM NOT SURE ABOUT WHETHER I SHALL GO I AM THE MOST INCURABLY LAZY
DEVIL THAT EVER STOOD IN SHOE LEATHERTHAT IS WHEN THE FIT IS ON
ME FOR I CAN BE SPRY ENOUGH AT TIMES
WHY IT IS JUST SUCH A CHANCE AS YOU HAVE BEEN LONGING FOR
MY DEAR FELLOW WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME SUPPOSING I UNRAVEL THE
WHOLE MATTER YOU MAY BE SURE THAT GREGSON LESTRADE AND CO WILL
POCKET ALL THE CREDIT THAT COMES OF BEING AN UNOFFICIAL PERSONAGE
BUT HE BEGS YOU TO HELP HIM
YES HE KNOWS THAT I AM HIS SUPERIOR AND ACKNOWLEDGES IT TO ME BUT
HE WOULD CUT HIS TONGUE OUT BEFORE HE WOULD OWN IT TO ANY THIRD
PERSON HOWEVER WE MAY AS WELL GO AND HAVE A LOOK I SHALL WORK IT
OUT ON MY OWN HOOK I MAY HAVE A LAUGH AT THEM IF I HAVE NOTHING
ELSE COME ON
HE HUSTLED ON HIS OVERCOAT AND BUSTLED ABOUT IN A WAY THAT SHOWED
THAT AN ENERGETIC FIT HAD SUPERSEDED THE APATHETIC ONE
GET YOUR HAT HE SAID
YOU WISH ME TO COME
YES IF YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO A MINUTE LATER WE WERE BOTH
IN A HANSOM DRIVING FURIOUSLY FOR THE BRIXTON ROAD
IT WAS A FOGGY CLOUDY MORNING AND A DUNCOLOURED VEIL HUNG OVER THE
HOUSETOPS LOOKING LIKE THE REFLECTION OF THE MUDCOLOURED STREETS
BENEATH MY COMPANION WAS IN THE BEST OF SPIRITS AND PRATTLED AWAY
ABOUT CREMONA FIDDLES AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STRADIVARIUS AND
AN AMATI AS FOR MYSELF I WAS SILENT FOR THE DULL WEATHER AND THE
MELANCHOLY BUSINESS UPON WHICH WE WERE ENGAGED DEPRESSED MY SPIRITS
YOU DONT SEEM TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO THE MATTER IN HAND I SAID
AT LAST INTERRUPTING HOLMES MUSICAL DISQUISITION
NO DATA YET HE ANSWERED IT IS A CAPITAL MISTAKE TO THEORIZE
BEFORE YOU HAVE ALL THE EVIDENCE IT BIASES THE JUDGMENT
YOU WILL HAVE YOUR DATA SOON I REMARKED POINTING WITH MY FINGER
THIS IS THE BRIXTON ROAD AND THAT IS THE HOUSE IF I AM NOT VERY
MUCH MISTAKEN
SO IT IS STOP DRIVER STOP WE WERE STILL A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO
FROM IT BUT HE INSISTED UPON OUR ALIGHTING AND WE FINISHED OUR
JOURNEY UPON FOOT
NUMBER LAURISTON GARDENS WORE AN ILLOMENED AND MINATORY LOOK IT
WAS ONE OF FOUR WHICH STOOD BACK SOME LITTLE WAY FROM THE STREET TWO
BEING OCCUPIED AND TWO EMPTY THE LATTER LOOKED OUT WITH THREE TIERS
OF VACANT MELANCHOLY WINDOWS WHICH WERE BLANK AND DREARY SAVE THAT
HERE AND THERE A TO LET CARD HAD DEVELOPED LIKE A CATARACT UPON THE
BLEARED PANES A SMALL GARDEN SPRINKLED OVER WITH A SCATTERED
ERUPTION OF SICKLY PLANTS SEPARATED EACH OF THESE HOUSES FROM THE
STREET AND WAS TRAVERSED BY A NARROW PATHWAY YELLOWISH IN COLOUR
AND CONSISTING APPARENTLY OF A MIXTURE OF CLAY AND OF GRAVEL THE
WHOLE PLACE WAS VERY SLOPPY FROM THE RAIN WHICH HAD FALLEN THROUGH
THE NIGHT THE GARDEN WAS BOUNDED BY A THREEFOOT BRICK WALL WITH A
FRINGE OF WOOD RAILS UPON THE TOP AND AGAINST THIS WALL WAS LEANING
A STALWART POLICE CONSTABLE SURROUNDED BY A SMALL KNOT OF LOAFERS
WHO CRANED THEIR NECKS AND STRAINED THEIR EYES IN THE VAIN HOPE OF
CATCHING SOME GLIMPSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS WITHIN
I HAD IMAGINED THAT SHERLOCK HOLMES WOULD AT ONCE HAVE HURRIED INTO
THE HOUSE AND PLUNGED INTO A STUDY OF THE MYSTERY NOTHING APPEARED
TO BE FURTHER FROM HIS INTENTION WITH AN AIR OF NONCHALANCE WHICH
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES SEEMED TO ME TO BORDER UPON AFFECTATION HE
LOUNGED UP AND DOWN THE PAVEMENT AND GAZED VACANTLY AT THE GROUND
THE SKY THE OPPOSITE HOUSES AND THE LINE OF RAILINGS HAVING
FINISHED HIS SCRUTINY HE PROCEEDED SLOWLY DOWN THE PATH OR RATHER
DOWN THE FRINGE OF GRASS WHICH FLANKED THE PATH KEEPING HIS EYES
RIVETED UPON THE GROUND TWICE HE STOPPED AND ONCE I SAW HIM SMILE
AND HEARD HIM UTTER AN EXCLAMATION OF SATISFACTION THERE WERE MANY
MARKS OF FOOTSTEPS UPON THE WET CLAYEY SOIL BUT SINCE THE POLICE HAD
BEEN COMING AND GOING OVER IT I WAS UNABLE TO SEE HOW MY COMPANION
COULD HOPE TO LEARN ANYTHING FROM IT STILL I HAD HAD SUCH
EXTRAORDINARY EVIDENCE OF THE QUICKNESS OF HIS PERCEPTIVE FACULTIES
THAT I HAD NO DOUBT THAT HE COULD SEE A GREAT DEAL WHICH WAS HIDDEN
FROM ME
AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE WE WERE MET BY A TALL WHITEFACED
FLAXENHAIRED MAN WITH A NOTEBOOK IN HIS HAND WHO RUSHED FORWARD
AND WRUNG MY COMPANIONS HAND WITH EFFUSION IT IS INDEED KIND OF
YOU TO COME HE SAID I HAVE HAD EVERYTHING LEFT UNTOUCHED
EXCEPT THAT MY FRIEND ANSWERED POINTING AT THE PATHWAY IF A
HERD OF BUFFALOES HAD PASSED ALONG THERE COULD NOT BE A GREATER MESS
NO DOUBT HOWEVER YOU HAD DRAWN YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS GREGSON
BEFORE YOU PERMITTED THIS
I HAVE HAD SO MUCH TO DO INSIDE THE HOUSE THE DETECTIVE SAID
EVASIVELY MY COLLEAGUE MR LESTRADE IS HERE I HAD RELIED UPON
HIM TO LOOK AFTER THIS
HOLMES GLANCED AT ME AND RAISED HIS EYEBROWS SARDONICALLY WITH TWO
SUCH MEN AS YOURSELF AND LESTRADE UPON THE GROUND THERE WILL NOT BE
MUCH FOR A THIRD PARTY TO FIND OUT HE SAID
GREGSON RUBBED HIS HANDS IN A SELFSATISFIED WAY I THINK WE HAVE
DONE ALL THAT CAN BE DONE HE ANSWERED ITS A QUEER CASE THOUGH
AND I KNEW YOUR TASTE FOR SUCH THINGS
YOU DID NOT COME HERE IN A CAB ASKED SHERLOCK HOLMES
NO SIR
NOR LESTRADE
NO SIR
THEN LET US GO AND LOOK AT THE ROOM WITH WHICH INCONSEQUENT REMARK
HE STRODE ON INTO THE HOUSE FOLLOWED BY GREGSON WHOSE FEATURES
EXPRESSED HIS ASTONISHMENT
A SHORT PASSAGE BARE PLANKED AND DUSTY LED TO THE KITCHEN AND
OFFICES TWO DOORS OPENED OUT OF IT TO THE LEFT AND TO THE RIGHT ONE
OF THESE HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN CLOSED FOR MANY WEEKS THE OTHER BELONGED
TO THE DININGROOM WHICH WAS THE APARTMENT IN WHICH THE MYSTERIOUS
AFFAIR HAD OCCURRED HOLMES WALKED IN AND I FOLLOWED HIM WITH THAT
SUBDUED FEELING AT MY HEART WHICH THE PRESENCE OF DEATH INSPIRES
IT WAS A LARGE SQUARE ROOM LOOKING ALL THE LARGER FROM THE ABSENCE
OF ALL FURNITURE A VULGAR FLARING PAPER ADORNED THE WALLS BUT IT
WAS BLOTCHED IN PLACES WITH MILDEW AND HERE AND THERE GREAT STRIPS
HAD BECOME DETACHED AND HUNG DOWN EXPOSING THE YELLOW PLASTER
BENEATH OPPOSITE THE DOOR WAS A SHOWY FIREPLACE SURMOUNTED BY A
MANTELPIECE OF IMITATION WHITE MARBLE ON ONE CORNER OF THIS WAS
STUCK THE STUMP OF A RED WAX CANDLE THE SOLITARY WINDOW WAS SO DIRTY
THAT THE LIGHT WAS HAZY AND UNCERTAIN GIVING A DULL GREY TINGE TO
EVERYTHING WHICH WAS INTENSIFIED BY THE THICK LAYER OF DUST WHICH
COATED THE WHOLE APARTMENT
ALL THESE DETAILS I OBSERVED AFTERWARDS AT PRESENT MY ATTENTION WAS
CENTRED UPON THE SINGLE GRIM MOTIONLESS FIGURE WHICH LAY STRETCHED
UPON THE BOARDS WITH VACANT SIGHTLESS EYES STARING UP AT THE
DISCOLOURED CEILING IT WAS THAT OF A MAN ABOUT FORTYTHREE OR
FORTYFOUR YEARS OF AGE MIDDLESIZED BROAD SHOULDERED WITH CRISP
CURLING BLACK HAIR AND A SHORT STUBBLY BEARD HE WAS DRESSED IN A
HEAVY BROADCLOTH FROCK COAT AND WAISTCOAT WITH LIGHTCOLOURED
TROUSERS AND IMMACULATE COLLAR AND CUFFS A TOP HAT WELL BRUSHED
AND TRIM WAS PLACED UPON THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM HIS HANDS WERE
CLENCHED AND HIS ARMS THROWN ABROAD WHILE HIS LOWER LIMBS WERE
INTERLOCKED AS THOUGH HIS DEATH STRUGGLE HAD BEEN A GRIEVOUS ONE ON
HIS RIGID FACE THERE STOOD AN EXPRESSION OF HORROR AND AS IT SEEMED
TO ME OF HATRED SUCH AS I HAVE NEVER SEEN UPON HUMAN FEATURES THIS
MALIGNANT AND TERRIBLE CONTORTION COMBINED WITH THE LOW FOREHEAD
BLUNT NOSE AND PROGNATHOUS JAW GAVE THE DEAD MAN A SINGULARLY
SIMIOUS AND APELIKE APPEARANCE WHICH WAS INCREASED BY HIS WRITHING
UNNATURAL POSTURE I HAVE SEEN DEATH IN MANY FORMS BUT NEVER HAS IT
APPEARED TO ME IN A MORE FEARSOME ASPECT THAN IN THAT DARK GRIMY
APARTMENT WHICH LOOKED OUT UPON ONE OF THE MAIN ARTERIES OF SUBURBAN
LONDON
LESTRADE LEAN AND FERRETLIKE AS EVER WAS STANDING BY THE DOORWAY
AND GREETED MY COMPANION AND MYSELF
THIS CASE WILL MAKE A STIR SIR HE REMARKED IT BEATS ANYTHING I
HAVE SEEN AND I AM NO CHICKEN
THERE IS NO CLUE SAID GREGSON
NONE AT ALL CHIMED IN LESTRADE
SHERLOCK HOLMES APPROACHED THE BODY AND KNEELING DOWN EXAMINED IT
INTENTLY YOU ARE SURE THAT THERE IS NO WOUND HE ASKED POINTING
TO NUMEROUS GOUTS AND SPLASHES OF BLOOD WHICH LAY ALL ROUND
POSITIVE CRIED BOTH DETECTIVES
THEN OF COURSE THIS BLOOD BELONGS TO A SECOND
INDIVIDUALPRESUMABLY THE MURDERER IF MURDER HAS BEEN COMMITTED IT
REMINDS ME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDANT ON THE DEATH OF VAN JANSEN
IN UTRECHT IN THE YEAR DO YOU REMEMBER THE CASE GREGSON
NO SIR
READ IT UPYOU REALLY SHOULD THERE IS NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN
IT HAS ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE
AS HE SPOKE HIS NIMBLE FINGERS WERE FLYING HERE THERE AND
EVERYWHERE FEELING PRESSING UNBUTTONING EXAMINING WHILE HIS EYES
WORE THE SAME FARAWAY EXPRESSION WHICH I HAVE ALREADY REMARKED UPON
SO SWIFTLY WAS THE EXAMINATION MADE THAT ONE WOULD HARDLY HAVE
GUESSED THE MINUTENESS WITH WHICH IT WAS CONDUCTED FINALLY HE
SNIFFED THE DEAD MANS LIPS AND THEN GLANCED AT THE SOLES OF HIS
PATENT LEATHER BOOTS
HE HAS NOT BEEN MOVED AT ALL HE ASKED
NO MORE THAN WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PURPOSES OF OUR EXAMINATION
YOU CAN TAKE HIM TO THE MORTUARY NOW HE SAID THERE IS NOTHING
MORE TO BE LEARNED
GREGSON HAD A STRETCHER AND FOUR MEN AT HAND AT HIS CALL THEY
ENTERED THE ROOM AND THE STRANGER WAS LIFTED AND CARRIED OUT AS
THEY RAISED HIM A RING TINKLED DOWN AND ROLLED ACROSS THE FLOOR
LESTRADE GRABBED IT UP AND STARED AT IT WITH MYSTIFIED EYES
THERES BEEN A WOMAN HERE HE CRIED ITS A WOMANS WEDDINGRING
HE HELD IT OUT AS HE SPOKE UPON THE PALM OF HIS HAND WE ALL
GATHERED ROUND HIM AND GAZED AT IT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT THAT
CIRCLET OF PLAIN GOLD HAD ONCE ADORNED THE FINGER OF A BRIDE
THIS COMPLICATES MATTERS SAID GREGSON HEAVEN KNOWS THEY WERE
COMPLICATED ENOUGH BEFORE
YOURE SURE IT DOESNT SIMPLIFY THEM OBSERVED HOLMES THERES
NOTHING TO BE LEARNED BY STARING AT IT WHAT DID YOU FIND IN HIS
POCKETS
WE HAVE IT ALL HERE SAID GREGSON POINTING TO A LITTER OF OBJECTS
UPON ONE OF THE BOTTOM STEPS OF THE STAIRS A GOLD WATCH NO BY BARRAUD
OF LONDON GOLD ALBERT CHAIN VERY HEAVY AND SOLID GOLD
RING WITH MASONIC DEVICE GOLD PINBULLDOGS HEAD WITH RUBIES AS
EYES RUSSIAN LEATHER CARDCASE WITH CARDS OF ENOCH J DREBBER OF
CLEVELAND CORRESPONDING WITH THE E J D UPON THE LINEN NO PURSE
BUT LOOSE MONEY TO THE EXTENT OF SEVEN POUNDS THIRTEEN POCKET
EDITION OF BOCCACCIOS DECAMERON WITH NAME OF JOSEPH STANGERSON
UPON THE FLYLEAF TWO LETTERSONE ADDRESSED TO E J DREBBER AND
ONE TO JOSEPH STANGERSON
AT WHAT ADDRESS
AMERICAN EXCHANGE STRANDTO BE LEFT TILL CALLED FOR THEY ARE BOTH
FROM THE GUION STEAMSHIP COMPANY AND REFER TO THE SAILING OF THEIR
BOATS FROM LIVERPOOL IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN WAS ABOUT
TO RETURN TO NEW YORK
HAVE YOU MADE ANY INQUIRIES AS TO THIS MAN STANGERSON
I DID IT AT ONCE SIR SAID GREGSON I HAVE HAD ADVERTISEMENTS
SENT TO ALL THE NEWSPAPERS AND ONE OF MY MEN HAS GONE TO THE
AMERICAN EXCHANGE BUT HE HAS NOT RETURNED YET
HAVE YOU SENT TO CLEVELAND
WE TELEGRAPHED THIS MORNING
HOW DID YOU WORD YOUR INQUIRIES
WE SIMPLY DETAILED THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND SAID THAT WE SHOULD BE
GLAD OF ANY INFORMATION WHICH COULD HELP US
YOU DID NOT ASK FOR PARTICULARS ON ANY POINT WHICH APPEARED TO YOU
TO BE CRUCIAL
I ASKED ABOUT STANGERSON
NOTHING ELSE IS THERE NO CIRCUMSTANCE ON WHICH THIS WHOLE CASE
APPEARS TO HINGE WILL YOU NOT TELEGRAPH AGAIN
I HAVE SAID ALL I HAVE TO SAY SAID GREGSON IN AN OFFENDED VOICE
SHERLOCK HOLMES CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF AND APPEARED TO BE ABOUT TO MAKE
SOME REMARK WHEN LESTRADE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE FRONT ROOM WHILE WE
WERE HOLDING THIS CONVERSATION IN THE HALL REAPPEARED UPON THE
SCENE RUBBING HIS HANDS IN A POMPOUS AND SELFSATISFIED MANNER
MR GREGSON HE SAID I HAVE JUST MADE A DISCOVERY OF THE HIGHEST
IMPORTANCE AND ONE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED HAD I NOT MADE A
CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE WALLS
THE LITTLE MANS EYES SPARKLED AS HE SPOKE AND HE WAS EVIDENTLY IN A
STATE OF SUPPRESSED EXULTATION AT HAVING SCORED A POINT AGAINST HIS
COLLEAGUE
COME HERE HE SAID BUSTLING BACK INTO THE ROOM THE ATMOSPHERE OF
WHICH FELT CLEARER SINCE THE REMOVAL OF ITS GHASTLY INMATE NOW
STAND THERE
HE STRUCK A MATCH ON HIS BOOT AND HELD IT UP AGAINST THE WALL
LOOK AT THAT HE SAID TRIUMPHANTLY
I HAVE REMARKED THAT THE PAPER HAD FALLEN AWAY IN PARTS IN THIS
PARTICULAR CORNER OF THE ROOM A LARGE PIECE HAD PEELED OFF LEAVING A
YELLOW SQUARE OF COARSE PLASTERING ACROSS THIS BARE SPACE THERE WAS
SCRAWLED IN BLOODRED LETTERS A SINGLE WORD
RACHE
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT CRIED THE DETECTIVE WITH THE AIR OF A
SHOWMAN EXHIBITING HIS SHOW THIS WAS OVERLOOKED BECAUSE IT WAS IN
THE DARKEST CORNER OF THE ROOM AND NO ONE THOUGHT OF LOOKING THERE
THE MURDERER HAS WRITTEN IT WITH HIS OR HER OWN BLOOD SEE THIS SMEAR
WHERE IT HAS TRICKLED DOWN THE WALL THAT DISPOSES OF THE IDEA OF
SUICIDE ANYHOW WHY WAS THAT CORNER CHOSEN TO WRITE IT ON I WILL
TELL YOU SEE THAT CANDLE ON THE MANTELPIECE IT WAS LIT AT THE TIME
AND IF IT WAS LIT THIS CORNER WOULD BE THE BRIGHTEST INSTEAD OF THE
DARKEST PORTION OF THE WALL
AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN NOW THAT YOU HAVE FOUND IT ASKED GREGSON IN
A DEPRECIATORY VOICE
MEAN WHY IT MEANS THAT THE WRITER WAS GOING TO PUT THE FEMALE NAME
RACHEL BUT WAS DISTURBED BEFORE HE OR SHE HAD TIME TO FINISH YOU
MARK MY WORDS WHEN THIS CASE COMES TO BE CLEARED UP YOU WILL FIND
THAT A WOMAN NAMED RACHEL HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT ITS ALL VERY
WELL FOR YOU TO LAUGH MR SHERLOCK HOLMES YOU MAY BE VERY SMART AND
CLEVER BUT THE OLD HOUND IS THE BEST WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE
I REALLY BEG YOUR PARDON SAID MY COMPANION WHO HAD RUFFLED THE
LITTLE MANS TEMPER BY BURSTING INTO AN EXPLOSION OF LAUGHTER YOU
CERTAINLY HAVE THE CREDIT OF BEING THE FIRST OF US TO FIND THIS OUT
AND AS YOU SAY IT BEARS EVERY MARK OF HAVING BEEN WRITTEN BY THE
OTHER PARTICIPANT IN LAST NIGHTS MYSTERY I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO
EXAMINE THIS ROOM YET BUT WITH YOUR PERMISSION I SHALL DO SO NOW
AS HE SPOKE HE WHIPPED A TAPE MEASURE AND A LARGE ROUND MAGNIFYING
GLASS FROM HIS POCKET WITH THESE TWO IMPLEMENTS HE TROTTED
NOISELESSLY ABOUT THE ROOM SOMETIMES STOPPING OCCASIONALLY
KNEELING AND ONCE LYING FLAT UPON HIS FACE SO ENGROSSED WAS HE WITH
HIS OCCUPATION THAT HE APPEARED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN OUR PRESENCE FOR
HE CHATTERED AWAY TO HIMSELF UNDER HIS BREATH THE WHOLE TIME KEEPING
UP A RUNNING FIRE OF EXCLAMATIONS GROANS WHISTLES AND LITTLE CRIES
SUGGESTIVE OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND OF HOPE AS I WATCHED HIM I WAS
IRRESISTIBLY REMINDED OF A PUREBLOODED WELLTRAINED FOXHOUND AS IT
DASHES BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS THROUGH THE COVERT WHINING IN ITS
EAGERNESS UNTIL IT COMES ACROSS THE LOST SCENT FOR TWENTY MINUTES
OR MORE HE CONTINUED HIS RESEARCHES MEASURING WITH THE MOST EXACT
CARE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MARKS WHICH WERE ENTIRELY INVISIBLE TO ME
AND OCCASIONALLY APPLYING HIS TAPE TO THE WALLS IN AN EQUALLY
INCOMPREHENSIBLE MANNER IN ONE PLACE HE GATHERED UP VERY CAREFULLY A
LITTLE PILE OF GREY DUST FROM THE FLOOR AND PACKED IT AWAY IN AN
ENVELOPE FINALLY HE EXAMINED WITH HIS GLASS THE WORD UPON THE WALL
GOING OVER EVERY LETTER OF IT WITH THE MOST MINUTE EXACTNESS THIS
DONE HE APPEARED TO BE SATISFIED FOR HE REPLACED HIS TAPE AND HIS
GLASS IN HIS POCKET
THEY SAY THAT GENIUS IS AN INFINITE CAPACITY FOR TAKING PAINS HE
REMARKED WITH A SMILE ITS A VERY BAD DEFINITION BUT IT DOES APPLY
TO DETECTIVE WORK
GREGSON AND LESTRADE HAD WATCHED THE MANOEUVRES OF THEIR AMATEUR
COMPANION WITH CONSIDERABLE CURIOSITY AND SOME CONTEMPT THEY
EVIDENTLY FAILED TO APPRECIATE THE FACT WHICH I HAD BEGUN TO
REALIZE THAT SHERLOCK HOLMES SMALLEST ACTIONS WERE ALL DIRECTED
TOWARDS SOME DEFINITE AND PRACTICAL END
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT SIR THEY BOTH ASKED
IT WOULD BE ROBBING YOU OF THE CREDIT OF THE CASE IF I WAS TO
PRESUME TO HELP YOU REMARKED MY FRIEND YOU ARE DOING SO WELL NOW
THAT IT WOULD BE A PITY FOR ANYONE TO INTERFERE THERE WAS A WORLD
OF SARCASM IN HIS VOICE AS HE SPOKE IF YOU WILL LET ME KNOW HOW
YOUR INVESTIGATIONS GO HE CONTINUED I SHALL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU
ANY HELP I CAN IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE
CONSTABLE WHO FOUND THE BODY CAN YOU GIVE ME HIS NAME AND ADDRESS
LESTRADE GLANCED AT HIS NOTEBOOK JOHN RANCE HE SAID HE IS OFF
DUTY NOW YOU WILL FIND HIM AT AUDLEY COURT KENNINGTON PARK
GATE
HOLMES TOOK A NOTE OF THE ADDRESS
COME ALONG DOCTOR HE SAID WE SHALL GO AND LOOK HIM UP ILL
TELL YOU ONE THING WHICH MAY HELP YOU IN THE CASE HE CONTINUED
TURNING TO THE TWO DETECTIVES THERE HAS BEEN MURDER DONE AND THE
MURDERER WAS A MAN HE WAS MORE THAN SIX FEET HIGH WAS IN THE PRIME
OF LIFE HAD SMALL FEET FOR HIS HEIGHT WORE COARSE SQUARETOED
BOOTS AND SMOKED A TRICHINOPOLY CIGAR HE CAME HERE WITH HIS VICTIM
IN A FOURWHEELED CAB WHICH WAS DRAWN BY A HORSE WITH THREE OLD
SHOES AND ONE NEW ONE ON HIS OFF FORE LEG IN ALL PROBABILITY THE
MURDERER HAD A FLORID FACE AND THE FINGERNAILS OF HIS RIGHT HAND
WERE REMARKABLY LONG THESE ARE ONLY A FEW INDICATIONS BUT THEY MAY
ASSIST YOU
LESTRADE AND GREGSON GLANCED AT EACH OTHER WITH AN INCREDULOUS SMILE
IF THIS MAN WAS MURDERED HOW WAS IT DONE ASKED THE FORMER
POISON SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES CURTLY AND STRODE OFF ONE OTHER
THING LESTRADE HE ADDED TURNING ROUND AT THE DOOR RACHE IS
THE GERMAN FOR REVENGE SO DONT LOSE YOUR TIME LOOKING FOR MISS
RACHEL
WITH WHICH PARTHIAN SHOT HE WALKED AWAY LEAVING THE TWO RIVALS
OPENMOUTHED BEHIND HIM CHAPTER IV
WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL
IT WAS ONE OCLOCK WHEN WE LEFT NO LAURISTON GARDENS SHERLOCK
HOLMES LED ME TO THE NEAREST TELEGRAPH OFFICE WHENCE HE DISPATCHED A
LONG TELEGRAM HE THEN HAILED A CAB AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO TAKE
US TO THE ADDRESS GIVEN US BY LESTRADE
THERE IS NOTHING LIKE FIRST HAND EVIDENCE HE REMARKED AS A
MATTER OF FACT MY MIND IS ENTIRELY MADE UP UPON THE CASE BUT STILL
WE MAY AS WELL LEARN ALL THAT IS TO BE LEARNED
YOU AMAZE ME HOLMES SAID I SURELY YOU ARE NOT AS SURE AS YOU
PRETEND TO BE OF ALL THOSE PARTICULARS WHICH YOU GAVE
THERES NO ROOM FOR A MISTAKE HE ANSWERED THE VERY FIRST THING
WHICH I OBSERVED ON ARRIVING THERE WAS THAT A CAB HAD MADE TWO RUTS
WITH ITS WHEELS CLOSE TO THE CURB NOW UP TO LAST NIGHT WE HAVE HAD
NO RAIN FOR A WEEK SO THAT THOSE WHEELS WHICH LEFT SUCH A DEEP
IMPRESSION MUST HAVE BEEN THERE DURING THE NIGHT THERE WERE THE
MARKS OF THE HORSES HOOFS TOO THE OUTLINE OF ONE OF WHICH WAS FAR
MORE CLEARLY CUT THAN THAT OF THE OTHER THREE SHOWING THAT THAT WAS
A NEW SHOE SINCE THE CAB WAS THERE AFTER THE RAIN BEGAN AND WAS NOT
THERE AT ANY TIME DURING THE MORNINGI HAVE GREGSONS WORD FOR
THATIT FOLLOWS THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN THERE DURING THE NIGHT AND
THEREFORE THAT IT BROUGHT THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS TO THE HOUSE
THAT SEEMS SIMPLE ENOUGH SAID I BUT HOW ABOUT THE OTHER MANS
HEIGHT
WHY THE HEIGHT OF A MAN IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN CAN BE TOLD FROM
THE LENGTH OF HIS STRIDE IT IS A SIMPLE CALCULATION ENOUGH THOUGH
THERE IS NO USE MY BORING YOU WITH FIGURES I HAD THIS FELLOWS
STRIDE BOTH ON THE CLAY OUTSIDE AND ON THE DUST WITHIN THEN I HAD A
WAY OF CHECKING MY CALCULATION WHEN A MAN WRITES ON A WALL HIS
INSTINCT LEADS HIM TO WRITE ABOUT THE LEVEL OF HIS OWN EYES NOW THAT
WRITING WAS JUST OVER SIX FEET FROM THE GROUND IT WAS CHILDS PLAY
AND HIS AGE I ASKED
WELL IF A MAN CAN STRIDE FOUR AND AHALF FEET WITHOUT THE SMALLEST
EFFORT HE CANT BE QUITE IN THE SERE AND YELLOW THAT WAS THE
BREADTH OF A PUDDLE ON THE GARDEN WALK WHICH HE HAD EVIDENTLY WALKED
ACROSS PATENTLEATHER BOOTS HAD GONE ROUND AND SQUARETOES HAD
HOPPED OVER THERE IS NO MYSTERY ABOUT IT AT ALL I AM SIMPLY
APPLYING TO ORDINARY LIFE A FEW OF THOSE PRECEPTS OF OBSERVATION AND
DEDUCTION WHICH I ADVOCATED IN THAT ARTICLE IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
THAT PUZZLES YOU
THE FINGER NAILS AND THE TRICHINOPOLY I SUGGESTED
THE WRITING ON THE WALL WAS DONE WITH A MANS FOREFINGER DIPPED IN
BLOOD MY GLASS ALLOWED ME TO OBSERVE THAT THE PLASTER WAS SLIGHTLY
SCRATCHED IN DOING IT WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE CASE IF THE
MANS NAIL HAD BEEN TRIMMED I GATHERED UP SOME SCATTERED ASH FROM
THE FLOOR IT WAS DARK IN COLOUR AND FLAKEYSUCH AN ASH AS IS ONLY
MADE BY A TRICHINOPOLY I HAVE MADE A SPECIAL STUDY OF CIGAR
ASHESIN FACT I HAVE WRITTEN A MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT I
FLATTER MYSELF THAT I CAN DISTINGUISH AT A GLANCE THE ASH OF ANY
KNOWN BRAND EITHER OF CIGAR OR OF TOBACCO IT IS JUST IN SUCH
DETAILS THAT THE SKILLED DETECTIVE DIFFERS FROM THE GREGSON AND
LESTRADE TYPE
AND THE FLORID FACE I ASKED
AH THAT WAS A MORE DARING SHOT THOUGH I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I WAS
RIGHT YOU MUST NOT ASK ME THAT AT THE PRESENT STATE OF THE AFFAIR
I PASSED MY HAND OVER MY BROW MY HEAD IS IN A WHIRL I REMARKED
THE MORE ONE THINKS OF IT THE MORE MYSTERIOUS IT GROWS HOW CAME
THESE TWO MENIF THERE WERE TWO MENINTO AN EMPTY HOUSE WHAT HAS
BECOME OF THE CABMAN WHO DROVE THEM HOW COULD ONE MAN COMPEL ANOTHER
TO TAKE POISON WHERE DID THE BLOOD COME FROM WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF
THE MURDERER SINCE ROBBERY HAD NO PART IN IT HOW CAME THE WOMANS
RING THERE ABOVE ALL WHY SHOULD THE SECOND MAN WRITE UP THE GERMAN
WORD RACHE BEFORE DECAMPING I CONFESS THAT I CANNOT SEE ANY POSSIBLE
WAY OF RECONCILING ALL THESE FACTS
MY COMPANION SMILED APPROVINGLY
YOU SUM UP THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE SITUATION SUCCINCTLY AND WELL
HE SAID THERE IS MUCH THAT IS STILL OBSCURE THOUGH I HAVE QUITE
MADE UP MY MIND ON THE MAIN FACTS AS TO POOR LESTRADES DISCOVERY IT
WAS SIMPLY A BLIND INTENDED TO PUT THE POLICE UPON A WRONG TRACK BY
SUGGESTING SOCIALISM AND SECRET SOCIETIES IT WAS NOT DONE BY A
GERMAN THE A IF YOU NOTICED WAS PRINTED SOMEWHAT AFTER THE GERMAN
FASHION NOW A REAL GERMAN INVARIABLY PRINTS IN THE LATIN CHARACTER
SO THAT WE MAY SAFELY SAY THAT THIS WAS NOT WRITTEN BY ONE BUT BY A
CLUMSY IMITATOR WHO OVERDID HIS PART IT WAS SIMPLY A RUSE TO DIVERT
INQUIRY INTO A WRONG CHANNEL IM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU MUCH MORE OF
THE CASE DOCTOR YOU KNOW A CONJUROR GETS NO CREDIT WHEN ONCE HE HAS
EXPLAINED HIS TRICK AND IF I SHOW YOU TOO MUCH OF MY METHOD OF
WORKING YOU WILL COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I AM A VERY ORDINARY
INDIVIDUAL AFTER ALL
I SHALL NEVER DO THAT I ANSWERED YOU HAVE BROUGHT DETECTION AS
NEAR AN EXACT SCIENCE AS IT EVER WILL BE BROUGHT IN THIS WORLD
MY COMPANION FLUSHED UP WITH PLEASURE AT MY WORDS AND THE EARNEST
WAY IN WHICH I UTTERED THEM I HAD ALREADY OBSERVED THAT HE WAS AS
SENSITIVE TO FLATTERY ON THE SCORE OF HIS ART AS ANY GIRL COULD BE OF
HER BEAUTY
ILL TELL YOU ONE OTHER THING HE SAID PATENTLEATHERS AND
SQUARETOES CAME IN THE SAME CAB AND THEY WALKED DOWN THE PATHWAY
TOGETHER AS FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLEARMINARM IN ALL PROBABILITY
WHEN THEY GOT INSIDE THEY WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOMOR RATHER
PATENTLEATHERS STOOD STILL WHILE SQUARETOES WALKED UP AND DOWN I
COULD READ ALL THAT IN THE DUST AND I COULD READ THAT AS HE WALKED
HE GREW MORE AND MORE EXCITED THAT IS SHOWN BY THE INCREASED LENGTH
OF HIS STRIDES HE WAS TALKING ALL THE WHILE AND WORKING HIMSELF UP
NO DOUBT INTO A FURY THEN THE TRAGEDY OCCURRED IVE TOLD YOU ALL I
KNOW MYSELF NOW FOR THE REST IS MERE SURMISE AND CONJECTURE WE HAVE
A GOOD WORKING BASIS HOWEVER ON WHICH TO START WE MUST HURRY UP
FOR I WANT TO GO TO HALLES CONCERT TO HEAR NORMAN NERUDA THIS
AFTERNOON
THIS CONVERSATION HAD OCCURRED WHILE OUR CAB HAD BEEN THREADING ITS
WAY THROUGH A LONG SUCCESSION OF DINGY STREETS AND DREARY BYWAYS IN
THE DINGIEST AND DREARIEST OF THEM OUR DRIVER SUDDENLY CAME TO A
STAND THATS AUDLEY COURT IN THERE HE SAID POINTING TO A NARROW
SLIT IN THE LINE OF DEADCOLOURED BRICK YOULL FIND ME HERE WHEN
YOU COME BACK
AUDLEY COURT WAS NOT AN ATTRACTIVE LOCALITY THE NARROW PASSAGE LED
US INTO A QUADRANGLE PAVED WITH FLAGS AND LINED BY SORDID DWELLINGS
WE PICKED OUR WAY AMONG GROUPS OF DIRTY CHILDREN AND THROUGH LINES
OF DISCOLOURED LINEN UNTIL WE CAME TO NUMBER THE DOOR OF WHICH
WAS DECORATED WITH A SMALL SLIP OF BRASS ON WHICH THE NAME RANCE WAS
ENGRAVED ON ENQUIRY WE FOUND THAT THE CONSTABLE WAS IN BED AND WE
WERE SHOWN INTO A LITTLE FRONT PARLOUR TO AWAIT HIS COMING
HE APPEARED PRESENTLY LOOKING A LITTLE IRRITABLE AT BEING DISTURBED
IN HIS SLUMBERS I MADE MY REPORT AT THE OFFICE HE SAID
HOLMES TOOK A HALFSOVEREIGN FROM HIS POCKET AND PLAYED WITH IT
PENSIVELY WE THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT ALL FROM YOUR
OWN LIPS HE SAID
I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO TELL YOU ANYTHING I CAN THE CONSTABLE
ANSWERED WITH HIS EYES UPON THE LITTLE GOLDEN DISK
JUST LET US HEAR IT ALL IN YOUR OWN WAY AS IT OCCURRED
RANCE SAT DOWN ON THE HORSEHAIR SOFA AND KNITTED HIS BROWS AS THOUGH
DETERMINED NOT TO OMIT ANYTHING IN HIS NARRATIVE
ILL TELL IT YE FROM THE BEGINNING HE SAID MY TIME IS FROM TEN
AT NIGHT TO SIX IN THE MORNING AT ELEVEN THERE WAS A FIGHT AT THE
WHITE HART BUT BAR THAT ALL WAS QUIET ENOUGH ON THE BEAT AT ONE
OCLOCK IT BEGAN TO RAIN AND I MET HARRY MURCHERHIM WHO HAS THE
HOLLAND GROVE BEATAND WE STOOD TOGETHER AT THE CORNER OF HENRIETTA
STREET ATALKIN PRESENTLYMAYBE ABOUT TWO OR A LITTLE AFTERI
THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE A LOOK ROUND AND SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT DOWN THE
BRIXTON ROAD IT WAS PRECIOUS DIRTY AND LONELY NOT A SOUL DID I MEET
ALL THE WAY DOWN THOUGH A CAB OR TWO WENT PAST ME I WAS A STROLLIN
DOWN THINKIN BETWEEN OURSELVES HOW UNCOMMON HANDY A FOUR OF GIN HOT
WOULD BE WHEN SUDDENLY THE GLINT OF A LIGHT CAUGHT MY EYE IN THE
WINDOW OF THAT SAME HOUSE NOW I KNEW THAT THEM TWO HOUSES IN
LAURISTON GARDENS WAS EMPTY ON ACCOUNT OF HIM THAT OWNS THEM WHO
WONT HAVE THE DRAINS SEED TO THOUGH THE VERY LAST TENANT WHAT LIVED
IN ONE OF THEM DIED O TYPHOID FEVER I WAS KNOCKED ALL IN A HEAP
THEREFORE AT SEEING A LIGHT IN THE WINDOW AND I SUSPECTED AS
SOMETHING WAS WRONG WHEN I GOT TO THE DOOR
YOU STOPPED AND THEN WALKED BACK TO THE GARDEN GATE MY COMPANION
INTERRUPTED WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR
RANCE GAVE A VIOLENT JUMP AND STARED AT SHERLOCK HOLMES WITH THE
UTMOST AMAZEMENT UPON HIS FEATURES
WHY THATS TRUE SIR HE SAID THOUGH HOW YOU COME TO KNOW IT
HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS YE SEE WHEN I GOT UP TO THE DOOR IT WAS SO STILL
AND SO LONESOME THAT I THOUGHT ID BE NONE THE WORSE FOR SOME ONE
WITH ME I AINT AFEARED OF ANYTHING ON THIS SIDE O THE GRAVE BUT I
THOUGHT THAT MAYBE IT WAS HIM THAT DIED O THE TYPHOID INSPECTING THE
DRAINS WHAT KILLED HIM THE THOUGHT GAVE ME A KIND O TURN AND I
WALKED BACK TO THE GATE TO SEE IF I COULD SEE MURCHERS LANTERN BUT
THERE WASNT NO SIGN OF HIM NOR OF ANYONE ELSE
THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE STREET
NOT A LIVIN SOUL SIR NOR AS MUCH AS A DOG THEN I PULLED MYSELF
TOGETHER AND WENT BACK AND PUSHED THE DOOR OPEN ALL WAS QUIET
INSIDE SO I WENT INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE LIGHT WAS ABURNIN THERE
WAS A CANDLE FLICKERIN ON THE MANTELPIECEA RED WAX ONEAND BY ITS
LIGHT I SAW
YES I KNOW ALL THAT YOU SAW YOU WALKED ROUND THE ROOM SEVERAL
TIMES AND YOU KNELT DOWN BY THE BODY AND THEN YOU WALKED THROUGH
AND TRIED THE KITCHEN DOOR AND THEN
JOHN RANCE SPRANG TO HIS FEET WITH A FRIGHTENED FACE AND SUSPICION IN
HIS EYES WHERE WAS YOU HID TO SEE ALL THAT HE CRIED IT SEEMS TO
ME THAT YOU KNOWS A DEAL MORE THAN YOU SHOULD
HOLMES LAUGHED AND THREW HIS CARD ACROSS THE TABLE TO THE CONSTABLE
DONT GET ARRESTING ME FOR THE MURDER HE SAID I AM ONE OF THE
HOUNDS AND NOT THE WOLF MR GREGSON OR MR LESTRADE WILL ANSWER FOR
THAT GO ON THOUGH WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT
RANCE RESUMED HIS SEAT WITHOUT HOWEVER LOSING HIS MYSTIFIED
EXPRESSION I WENT BACK TO THE GATE AND SOUNDED MY WHISTLE THAT
BROUGHT MURCHER AND TWO MORE TO THE SPOT
WAS THE STREET EMPTY THEN
WELL IT WAS AS FAR AS ANYBODY THAT COULD BE OF ANY GOOD GOES
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THE CONSTABLES FEATURES BROADENED INTO A GRIN IVE SEEN MANY A
DRUNK CHAP IN MY TIME HE SAID BUT NEVER ANYONE SO CRYIN DRUNK AS
THAT COVE HE WAS AT THE GATE WHEN I CAME OUT ALEANIN UP AGIN THE
RAILINGS AND ASINGIN AT THE PITCH O HIS LUNGS ABOUT COLUMBINES
NEWFANGLED BANNER OR SOME SUCH STUFF HE COULDNT STAND FAR LESS
HELP
WHAT SORT OF A MAN WAS HE ASKED SHERLOCK HOLMES
JOHN RANCE APPEARED TO BE SOMEWHAT IRRITATED AT THIS DIGRESSION HE
WAS AN UNCOMMON DRUNK SORT O MAN HE SAID HED HA FOUND HISSELF
IN THE STATION IF WE HADNT BEEN SO TOOK UP
HIS FACEHIS DRESSDIDNT YOU NOTICE THEM HOLMES BROKE IN
IMPATIENTLY
I SHOULD THINK I DID NOTICE THEM SEEING THAT I HAD TO PROP HIM
UPME AND MURCHER BETWEEN US HE WAS A LONG CHAP WITH A RED FACE
THE LOWER PART MUFFLED ROUND
THAT WILL DO CRIED HOLMES WHAT BECAME OF HIM
WED ENOUGH TO DO WITHOUT LOOKIN AFTER HIM THE POLICEMAN SAID IN
AN AGGRIEVED VOICE ILL WAGER HE FOUND HIS WAY HOME ALL RIGHT
HOW WAS HE DRESSED
A BROWN OVERCOAT
HAD HE A WHIP IN HIS HAND
A WHIPNO
HE MUST HAVE LEFT IT BEHIND MUTTERED MY COMPANION YOU DIDNT
HAPPEN TO SEE OR HEAR A CAB AFTER THAT
NO
THERES A HALFSOVEREIGN FOR YOU MY COMPANION SAID STANDING UP
AND TAKING HIS HAT I AM AFRAID RANCE THAT YOU WILL NEVER RISE IN
THE FORCE THAT HEAD OF YOURS SHOULD BE FOR USE AS WELL AS ORNAMENT
YOU MIGHT HAVE GAINED YOUR SERGEANTS STRIPES LAST NIGHT THE MAN
WHOM YOU HELD IN YOUR HANDS IS THE MAN WHO HOLDS THE CLUE OF THIS
MYSTERY AND WHOM WE ARE SEEKING THERE IS NO USE OF ARGUING ABOUT IT
NOW I TELL YOU THAT IT IS SO COME ALONG DOCTOR
WE STARTED OFF FOR THE CAB TOGETHER LEAVING OUR INFORMANT
INCREDULOUS BUT OBVIOUSLY UNCOMFORTABLE
THE BLUNDERING FOOL HOLMES SAID BITTERLY AS WE DROVE BACK TO OUR
LODGINGS JUST TO THINK OF HIS HAVING SUCH AN INCOMPARABLE BIT OF
GOOD LUCK AND NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT
I AM RATHER IN THE DARK STILL IT IS TRUE THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF
THIS MAN TALLIES WITH YOUR IDEA OF THE SECOND PARTY IN THIS MYSTERY
BUT WHY SHOULD HE COME BACK TO THE HOUSE AFTER LEAVING IT THAT IS
NOT THE WAY OF CRIMINALS
THE RING MAN THE RING THAT WAS WHAT HE CAME BACK FOR IF WE HAVE
NO OTHER WAY OF CATCHING HIM WE CAN ALWAYS BAIT OUR LINE WITH THE
RING I SHALL HAVE HIM DOCTORILL LAY YOU TWO TO ONE THAT I HAVE
HIM I MUST THANK YOU FOR IT ALL I MIGHT NOT HAVE GONE BUT FOR YOU
AND SO HAVE MISSED THE FINEST STUDY I EVER CAME ACROSS A STUDY IN
SCARLET EH WHY SHOULDNT WE USE A LITTLE ART JARGON THERES THE
SCARLET THREAD OF MURDER RUNNING THROUGH THE COLOURLESS SKEIN OF
LIFE AND OUR DUTY IS TO UNRAVEL IT AND ISOLATE IT AND EXPOSE EVERY
INCH OF IT AND NOW FOR LUNCH AND THEN FOR NORMAN NERUDA HER ATTACK
AND HER BOWING ARE SPLENDID WHATS THAT LITTLE THING OF CHOPINS SHE
PLAYS SO MAGNIFICENTLY TRALALALIRALIRALAY
LEANING BACK IN THE CAB THIS AMATEUR BLOODHOUND CAROLLED AWAY LIKE A
LARK WHILE I MEDITATED UPON THE MANYSIDEDNESS OF THE HUMAN MIND
CHAPTER V
OUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR
OUR MORNINGS EXERTIONS HAD BEEN TOO MUCH FOR MY WEAK HEALTH AND I
WAS TIRED OUT IN THE AFTERNOON AFTER HOLMES DEPARTURE FOR THE
CONCERT I LAY DOWN UPON THE SOFA AND ENDEAVOURED TO GET A COUPLE OF
HOURS SLEEP IT WAS A USELESS ATTEMPT MY MIND HAD BEEN TOO MUCH
EXCITED BY ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED AND THE STRANGEST FANCIES AND
SURMISES CROWDED INTO IT EVERY TIME THAT I CLOSED MY EYES I SAW
BEFORE ME THE DISTORTED BABOONLIKE COUNTENANCE OF THE MURDERED MAN
SO SINISTER WAS THE IMPRESSION WHICH THAT FACE HAD PRODUCED UPON ME
THAT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO FEEL ANYTHING BUT GRATITUDE FOR HIM WHO
HAD REMOVED ITS OWNER FROM THE WORLD IF EVER HUMAN FEATURES BESPOKE
VICE OF THE MOST MALIGNANT TYPE THEY WERE CERTAINLY THOSE OF ENOCH
J DREBBER OF CLEVELAND STILL I RECOGNIZED THAT JUSTICE MUST BE
DONE AND THAT THE DEPRAVITY OF THE VICTIM WAS NO CONDONEMENT IN THE
EYES OF THE LAW
THE MORE I THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE EXTRAORDINARY DID MY COMPANIONS
HYPOTHESIS THAT THE MAN HAD BEEN POISONED APPEAR I REMEMBERED HOW
HE HAD SNIFFED HIS LIPS AND HAD NO DOUBT THAT HE HAD DETECTED
SOMETHING WHICH HAD GIVEN RISE TO THE IDEA THEN AGAIN IF NOT
POISON WHAT HAD CAUSED THE MANS DEATH SINCE THERE WAS NEITHER
WOUND NOR MARKS OF STRANGULATION BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WHOSE BLOOD
WAS THAT WHICH LAY SO THICKLY UPON THE FLOOR THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF
A STRUGGLE NOR HAD THE VICTIM ANY WEAPON WITH WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE
WOUNDED AN ANTAGONIST AS LONG AS ALL THESE QUESTIONS WERE UNSOLVED
I FELT THAT SLEEP WOULD BE NO EASY MATTER EITHER FOR HOLMES OR
MYSELF HIS QUIET SELFCONFIDENT MANNER CONVINCED ME THAT HE HAD
ALREADY FORMED A THEORY WHICH EXPLAINED ALL THE FACTS THOUGH WHAT IT
WAS I COULD NOT FOR AN INSTANT CONJECTURE
HE WAS VERY LATE IN RETURNINGSO LATE THAT I KNEW THAT THE CONCERT
COULD NOT HAVE DETAINED HIM ALL THE TIME DINNER WAS ON THE TABLE
BEFORE HE APPEARED
IT WAS MAGNIFICENT HE SAID AS HE TOOK HIS SEAT DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT DARWIN SAYS ABOUT MUSIC HE CLAIMS THAT THE POWER OF PRODUCING
AND APPRECIATING IT EXISTED AMONG THE HUMAN RACE LONG BEFORE THE
POWER OF SPEECH WAS ARRIVED AT PERHAPS THAT IS WHY WE ARE SO SUBTLY
INFLUENCED BY IT THERE ARE VAGUE MEMORIES IN OUR SOULS OF THOSE
MISTY CENTURIES WHEN THE WORLD WAS IN ITS CHILDHOOD
THATS RATHER A BROAD IDEA I REMARKED
ONES IDEAS MUST BE AS BROAD AS NATURE IF THEY ARE TO INTERPRET
NATURE HE ANSWERED WHATS THE MATTER YOURE NOT LOOKING QUITE
YOURSELF THIS BRIXTON ROAD AFFAIR HAS UPSET YOU
TO TELL THE TRUTH IT HAS I SAID I OUGHT TO BE MORE
CASEHARDENED AFTER MY AFGHAN EXPERIENCES I SAW MY OWN COMRADES
HACKED TO PIECES AT MAIWAND WITHOUT LOSING MY NERVE
I CAN UNDERSTAND THERE IS A MYSTERY ABOUT THIS WHICH STIMULATES THE
IMAGINATION WHERE THERE IS NO IMAGINATION THERE IS NO HORROR HAVE
YOU SEEN THE EVENING PAPER
NO
IT GIVES A FAIRLY GOOD ACCOUNT OF THE AFFAIR IT DOES NOT MENTION
THE FACT THAT WHEN THE MAN WAS RAISED UP A WOMANS WEDDING RING FELL
UPON THE FLOOR IT IS JUST AS WELL IT DOES NOT
WHY
LOOK AT THIS ADVERTISEMENT HE ANSWERED I HAD ONE SENT TO EVERY
PAPER THIS MORNING IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE AFFAIR
HE THREW THE PAPER ACROSS TO ME AND I GLANCED AT THE PLACE INDICATED
IT WAS THE FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE FOUND COLUMN IN BRIXTON
ROAD THIS MORNING IT RAN A PLAIN GOLD WEDDING RING FOUND IN THE
ROADWAY BETWEEN THE WHITE HART TAVERN AND HOLLAND GROVE APPLY DR
WATSON B BAKER STREET BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE THIS EVENING
EXCUSE MY USING YOUR NAME HE SAID IF I USED MY OWN SOME OF THESE
DUNDERHEADS WOULD RECOGNIZE IT AND WANT TO MEDDLE IN THE AFFAIR
THAT IS ALL RIGHT I ANSWERED BUT SUPPOSING ANYONE APPLIES I
HAVE NO RING
OH YES YOU HAVE SAID HE HANDING ME ONE THIS WILL DO VERY WELL
IT IS ALMOST A FACSIMILE
AND WHO DO YOU EXPECT WILL ANSWER THIS ADVERTISEMENT
WHY THE MAN IN THE BROWN COATOUR FLORID FRIEND WITH THE SQUARE
TOES IF HE DOES NOT COME HIMSELF HE WILL SEND AN ACCOMPLICE
WOULD HE NOT CONSIDER IT AS TOO DANGEROUS
NOT AT ALL IF MY VIEW OF THE CASE IS CORRECT AND I HAVE EVERY
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS THIS MAN WOULD RATHER RISK ANYTHING
THAN LOSE THE RING ACCORDING TO MY NOTION HE DROPPED IT WHILE
STOOPING OVER DREBBERS BODY AND DID NOT MISS IT AT THE TIME AFTER
LEAVING THE HOUSE HE DISCOVERED HIS LOSS AND HURRIED BACK BUT FOUND
THE POLICE ALREADY IN POSSESSION OWING TO HIS OWN FOLLY IN LEAVING
THE CANDLE BURNING HE HAD TO PRETEND TO BE DRUNK IN ORDER TO ALLAY
THE SUSPICIONS WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN AROUSED BY HIS APPEARANCE AT THE
GATE NOW PUT YOURSELF IN THAT MANS PLACE ON THINKING THE MATTER
OVER IT MUST HAVE OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT HE HAD
LOST THE RING IN THE ROAD AFTER LEAVING THE HOUSE WHAT WOULD HE DO
THEN HE WOULD EAGERLY LOOK OUT FOR THE EVENING PAPERS IN THE HOPE OF
SEEING IT AMONG THE ARTICLES FOUND HIS EYE OF COURSE WOULD LIGHT
UPON THIS HE WOULD BE OVERJOYED WHY SHOULD HE FEAR A TRAP THERE
WOULD BE NO REASON IN HIS EYES WHY THE FINDING OF THE RING SHOULD BE
CONNECTED WITH THE MURDER HE WOULD COME HE WILL COME YOU SHALL SEE
HIM WITHIN AN HOUR
AND THEN I ASKED
OH YOU CAN LEAVE ME TO DEAL WITH HIM THEN HAVE YOU ANY ARMS
I HAVE MY OLD SERVICE REVOLVER AND A FEW CARTRIDGES
YOU HAD BETTER CLEAN IT AND LOAD IT HE WILL BE A DESPERATE MAN AND
THOUGH I SHALL TAKE HIM UNAWARES IT IS AS WELL TO BE READY FOR
ANYTHING
I WENT TO MY BEDROOM AND FOLLOWED HIS ADVICE WHEN I RETURNED WITH
THE PISTOL THE TABLE HAD BEEN CLEARED AND HOLMES WAS ENGAGED IN HIS
FAVOURITE OCCUPATION OF SCRAPING UPON HIS VIOLIN
THE PLOT THICKENS HE SAID AS I ENTERED I HAVE JUST HAD AN
ANSWER TO MY AMERICAN TELEGRAM MY VIEW OF THE CASE IS THE CORRECT
ONE
AND THAT IS I ASKED EAGERLY
MY FIDDLE WOULD BE THE BETTER FOR NEW STRINGS HE REMARKED PUT
YOUR PISTOL IN YOUR POCKET WHEN THE FELLOW COMES SPEAK TO HIM IN AN
ORDINARY WAY LEAVE THE REST TO ME DONT FRIGHTEN HIM BY LOOKING AT
HIM TOO HARD
IT IS EIGHT OCLOCK NOW I SAID GLANCING AT MY WATCH
YES HE WILL PROBABLY BE HERE IN A FEW MINUTES OPEN THE DOOR
SLIGHTLY THAT WILL DO NOW PUT THE KEY ON THE INSIDE THANK YOU
THIS IS A QUEER OLD BOOK I PICKED UP AT A STALL YESTERDAYDE JURE
INTER GENTESPUBLISHED IN LATIN AT LIEGE IN THE LOWLANDS IN CHARLES
HEAD WAS STILL FIRM ON HIS SHOULDERS WHEN THIS LITTLE
BROWNBACKED VOLUME WAS STRUCK OFF
WHO IS THE PRINTER
PHILIPPE DE CROY WHOEVER HE MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE FLYLEAF IN VERY
FADED INK IS WRITTEN EX LIBRIS GULIOLMI WHYTE I WONDER WHO
WILLIAM WHYTE WAS SOME PRAGMATICAL SEVENTEENTH CENTURY LAWYER I
SUPPOSE HIS WRITING HAS A LEGAL TWIST ABOUT IT HERE COMES OUR MAN
I THINK
AS HE SPOKE THERE WAS A SHARP RING AT THE BELL SHERLOCK HOLMES ROSE
SOFTLY AND MOVED HIS CHAIR IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DOOR WE HEARD THE
SERVANT PASS ALONG THE HALL AND THE SHARP CLICK OF THE LATCH AS SHE
OPENED IT
DOES DR WATSON LIVE HERE ASKED A CLEAR BUT RATHER HARSH VOICE WE
COULD NOT HEAR THE SERVANTS REPLY BUT THE DOOR CLOSED AND SOME ONE
BEGAN TO ASCEND THE STAIRS THE FOOTFALL WAS AN UNCERTAIN AND
SHUFFLING ONE A LOOK OF SURPRISE PASSED OVER THE FACE OF MY
COMPANION AS HE LISTENED TO IT IT CAME SLOWLY ALONG THE PASSAGE AND
THERE WAS A FEEBLE TAP AT THE DOOR
COME IN I CRIED
AT MY SUMMONS INSTEAD OF THE MAN OF VIOLENCE WHOM WE EXPECTED A
VERY OLD AND WRINKLED WOMAN HOBBLED INTO THE APARTMENT SHE APPEARED
TO BE DAZZLED BY THE SUDDEN BLAZE OF LIGHT AND AFTER DROPPING A
CURTSEY SHE STOOD BLINKING AT US WITH HER BLEARED EYES AND FUMBLING
IN HER POCKET WITH NERVOUS SHAKY FINGERS I GLANCED AT MY COMPANION
AND HIS FACE HAD ASSUMED SUCH A DISCONSOLATE EXPRESSION THAT IT WAS
ALL I COULD DO TO KEEP MY COUNTENANCE
THE OLD CRONE DREW OUT AN EVENING PAPER AND POINTED AT OUR
ADVERTISEMENT ITS THIS AS HAS BROUGHT ME GOOD GENTLEMEN SHE
SAID DROPPING ANOTHER CURTSEY A GOLD WEDDING RING IN THE BRIXTON
ROAD IT BELONGS TO MY GIRL SALLY AS WAS MARRIED ONLY THIS TIME
TWELVEMONTH WHICH HER HUSBAND IS STEWARD ABOARD A UNION BOAT AND
WHAT HED SAY IF HE COMES OME AND FOUND HER WITHOUT HER RING IS MORE
THAN I CAN THINK HE BEING SHORT ENOUGH AT THE BEST O TIMES BUT
MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN HE HAS THE DRINK IF IT PLEASE YOU SHE WENT TO
THE CIRCUS LAST NIGHT ALONG WITH
IS THAT HER RING I ASKED
THE LORD BE THANKED CRIED THE OLD WOMAN SALLY WILL BE A GLAD
WOMAN THIS NIGHT THATS THE RING
AND WHAT MAY YOUR ADDRESS BE I INQUIRED TAKING UP A PENCIL
DUNCAN STREET HOUNDSDITCH A WEARY WAY FROM HERE
THE BRIXTON ROAD DOES NOT LIE BETWEEN ANY CIRCUS AND HOUNDSDITCH
SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES SHARPLY
THE OLD WOMAN FACED ROUND AND LOOKED KEENLY AT HIM FROM HER LITTLE
REDRIMMED EYES THE GENTLEMAN ASKED ME FOR MY ADDRESS SHE SAID
SALLY LIVES IN LODGINGS AT MAYFIELD PLACE PECKHAM
AND YOUR NAME IS
MY NAME IS SAWYERHERS IS DENNIS WHICH TOM DENNIS MARRIED
HERAND A SMART CLEAN LAD TOO AS LONG AS HES AT SEA AND NO
STEWARD IN THE COMPANY MORE THOUGHT OF BUT WHEN ON SHORE WHAT WITH
THE WOMEN AND WHAT WITH LIQUOR SHOPS
HERE IS YOUR RING MRS SAWYER I INTERRUPTED IN OBEDIENCE TO A
SIGN FROM MY COMPANION IT CLEARLY BELONGS TO YOUR DAUGHTER AND I
AM GLAD TO BE ABLE TO RESTORE IT TO THE RIGHTFUL OWNER
WITH MANY MUMBLED BLESSINGS AND PROTESTATIONS OF GRATITUDE THE OLD
CRONE PACKED IT AWAY IN HER POCKET AND SHUFFLED OFF DOWN THE STAIRS
SHERLOCK HOLMES SPRANG TO HIS FEET THE MOMENT THAT SHE WAS GONE AND
RUSHED INTO HIS ROOM HE RETURNED IN A FEW SECONDS ENVELOPED IN AN
ULSTER AND A CRAVAT ILL FOLLOW HER HE SAID HURRIEDLY SHE MUST
BE AN ACCOMPLICE AND WILL LEAD ME TO HIM WAIT UP FOR ME THE HALL
DOOR HAD HARDLY SLAMMED BEHIND OUR VISITOR BEFORE HOLMES HAD
DESCENDED THE STAIR LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW I COULD SEE HER
WALKING FEEBLY ALONG THE OTHER SIDE WHILE HER PURSUER DOGGED HER
SOME LITTLE DISTANCE BEHIND EITHER HIS WHOLE THEORY IS INCORRECT
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF OR ELSE HE WILL BE LED NOW TO THE HEART OF THE
MYSTERY THERE WAS NO NEED FOR HIM TO ASK ME TO WAIT UP FOR HIM FOR
I FELT THAT SLEEP WAS IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL I HEARD THE RESULT OF HIS
ADVENTURE
IT WAS CLOSE UPON NINE WHEN HE SET OUT I HAD NO IDEA HOW LONG HE
MIGHT BE BUT I SAT STOLIDLY PUFFING AT MY PIPE AND SKIPPING OVER THE
PAGES OF HENRI MURGERS VIE DE BOHME TEN OCLOCK PASSED AND I
HEARD THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE MAID AS THEY PATTERED OFF TO BED ELEVEN
AND THE MORE STATELY TREAD OF THE LANDLADY PASSED MY DOOR BOUND FOR
THE SAME DESTINATION IT WAS CLOSE UPON TWELVE BEFORE I HEARD THE
SHARP SOUND OF HIS LATCHKEY THE INSTANT HE ENTERED I SAW BY HIS
FACE THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL AMUSEMENT AND CHAGRIN SEEMED TO
BE STRUGGLING FOR THE MASTERY UNTIL THE FORMER SUDDENLY CARRIED THE
DAY AND HE BURST INTO A HEARTY LAUGH
I WOULDNT HAVE THE SCOTLAND YARDERS KNOW IT FOR THE WORLD HE
CRIED DROPPING INTO HIS CHAIR I HAVE CHAFFED THEM SO MUCH THAT
THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE LET ME HEAR THE END OF IT I CAN AFFORD TO
LAUGH BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I WILL BE EVEN WITH THEM IN THE LONG RUN
WHAT IS IT THEN I ASKED
OH I DONT MIND TELLING A STORY AGAINST MYSELF THAT CREATURE HAD
GONE A LITTLE WAY WHEN SHE BEGAN TO LIMP AND SHOW EVERY SIGN OF BEING
FOOTSORE PRESENTLY SHE CAME TO A HALT AND HAILED A FOURWHEELER
WHICH WAS PASSING I MANAGED TO BE CLOSE TO HER SO AS TO HEAR THE
ADDRESS BUT I NEED NOT HAVE BEEN SO ANXIOUS FOR SHE SANG IT OUT
LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET DRIVE TO
DUNCAN STREET HOUNDSDITCH SHE CRIED THIS BEGINS TO LOOK
GENUINE I THOUGHT AND HAVING SEEN HER SAFELY INSIDE I PERCHED
MYSELF BEHIND THATS AN ART WHICH EVERY DETECTIVE SHOULD BE AN
EXPERT AT WELL AWAY WE RATTLED AND NEVER DREW REIN UNTIL WE
REACHED THE STREET IN QUESTION I HOPPED OFF BEFORE WE CAME TO THE
DOOR AND STROLLED DOWN THE STREET IN AN EASY LOUNGING WAY I SAW
THE CAB PULL UP THE DRIVER JUMPED DOWN AND I SAW HIM OPEN THE DOOR
AND STAND EXPECTANTLY NOTHING CAME OUT THOUGH WHEN I REACHED HIM HE
WAS GROPING ABOUT FRANTICALLY IN THE EMPTY CAB AND GIVING VENT TO
THE FINEST ASSORTED COLLECTION OF OATHS THAT EVER I LISTENED TO
THERE WAS NO SIGN OR TRACE OF HIS PASSENGER AND I FEAR IT WILL BE
SOME TIME BEFORE HE GETS HIS FARE ON INQUIRING AT NUMBER WE FOUND
THAT THE HOUSE BELONGED TO A RESPECTABLE PAPERHANGER NAMED KESWICK
AND THAT NO ONE OF THE NAME EITHER OF SAWYER OR DENNIS HAD EVER BEEN
HEARD OF THERE
YOU DONT MEAN TO SAY I CRIED IN AMAZEMENT THAT THAT TOTTERING
FEEBLE OLD WOMAN WAS ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE CAB WHILE IT WAS IN
MOTION WITHOUT EITHER YOU OR THE DRIVER SEEING HER
OLD WOMAN BE DAMNED SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES SHARPLY WE WERE THE
OLD WOMEN TO BE SO TAKEN IN IT MUST HAVE BEEN A YOUNG MAN AND AN
ACTIVE ONE TOO BESIDES BEING AN INCOMPARABLE ACTOR THE GETUP WAS
INIMITABLE HE SAW THAT HE WAS FOLLOWED NO DOUBT AND USED THIS
MEANS OF GIVING ME THE SLIP IT SHOWS THAT THE MAN WE ARE AFTER IS
NOT AS LONELY AS I IMAGINED HE WAS BUT HAS FRIENDS WHO ARE READY TO
RISK SOMETHING FOR HIM NOW DOCTOR YOU ARE LOOKING DONEUP TAKE MY
ADVICE AND TURN IN
I WAS CERTAINLY FEELING VERY WEARY SO I OBEYED HIS INJUNCTION I
LEFT HOLMES SEATED IN FRONT OF THE SMOULDERING FIRE AND LONG INTO
THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT I HEARD THE LOW MELANCHOLY WAILINGS OF HIS
VIOLIN AND KNEW THAT HE WAS STILL PONDERING OVER THE STRANGE PROBLEM
WHICH HE HAD SET HIMSELF TO UNRAVEL
CHAPTER VI
TOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO
THE PAPERS NEXT DAY WERE FULL OF THE BRIXTON MYSTERY AS THEY
TERMED IT EACH HAD A LONG ACCOUNT OF THE AFFAIR AND SOME HAD
LEADERS UPON IT IN ADDITION THERE WAS SOME INFORMATION IN THEM WHICH
WAS NEW TO ME I STILL RETAIN IN MY SCRAPBOOK NUMEROUS CLIPPINGS AND
EXTRACTS BEARING UPON THE CASE HERE IS A CONDENSATION OF A FEW OF
THEM
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH REMARKED THAT IN THE HISTORY OF CRIME THERE HAD
SELDOM BEEN A TRAGEDY WHICH PRESENTED STRANGER FEATURES THE GERMAN
NAME OF THE VICTIM THE ABSENCE OF ALL OTHER MOTIVE AND THE SINISTER
INSCRIPTION ON THE WALL ALL POINTED TO ITS PERPETRATION BY POLITICAL
REFUGEES AND REVOLUTIONISTS THE SOCIALISTS HAD MANY BRANCHES IN
AMERICA AND THE DECEASED HAD NO DOUBT INFRINGED THEIR UNWRITTEN
LAWS AND BEEN TRACKED DOWN BY THEM AFTER ALLUDING AIRILY TO THE
VEHMGERICHT AQUA TOFANA CARBONARI THE MARCHIONESS DE BRINVILLIERS
THE DARWINIAN THEORY THE PRINCIPLES OF MALTHUS AND THE RATCLIFF
HIGHWAY MURDERS THE ARTICLE CONCLUDED BY ADMONISHING THE GOVERNMENT
AND ADVOCATING A CLOSER WATCH OVER FOREIGNERS IN ENGLAND
THE STANDARD COMMENTED UPON THE FACT THAT LAWLESS OUTRAGES OF THE
SORT USUALLY OCCURRED UNDER A LIBERAL ADMINISTRATION THEY AROSE FROM
THE UNSETTLING OF THE MINDS OF THE MASSES AND THE CONSEQUENT
WEAKENING OF ALL AUTHORITY THE DECEASED WAS AN AMERICAN GENTLEMAN
WHO HAD BEEN RESIDING FOR SOME WEEKS IN THE METROPOLIS HE HAD STAYED
AT THE BOARDINGHOUSE OF MADAME CHARPENTIER IN TORQUAY TERRACE
CAMBERWELL HE WAS ACCOMPANIED IN HIS TRAVELS BY HIS PRIVATE
SECRETARY MR JOSEPH STANGERSON THE TWO BADE ADIEU TO THEIR
LANDLADY UPON TUESDAY THE TH INST AND DEPARTED TO EUSTON STATION
WITH THE AVOWED INTENTION OF CATCHING THE LIVERPOOL EXPRESS THEY
WERE AFTERWARDS SEEN TOGETHER UPON THE PLATFORM NOTHING MORE IS
KNOWN OF THEM UNTIL MR DREBBERS BODY WAS AS RECORDED DISCOVERED
IN AN EMPTY HOUSE IN THE BRIXTON ROAD MANY MILES FROM EUSTON HOW HE
CAME THERE OR HOW HE MET HIS FATE ARE QUESTIONS WHICH ARE STILL
INVOLVED IN MYSTERY NOTHING IS KNOWN OF THE WHEREABOUTS OF
STANGERSON WE ARE GLAD TO LEARN THAT MR LESTRADE AND MR GREGSON
OF SCOTLAND YARD ARE BOTH ENGAGED UPON THE CASE AND IT IS
CONFIDENTLY ANTICIPATED THAT THESE WELLKNOWN OFFICERS WILL SPEEDILY
THROW LIGHT UPON THE MATTER
THE DAILY NEWS OBSERVED THAT THERE WAS NO DOUBT AS TO THE CRIME BEING
A POLITICAL ONE THE DESPOTISM AND HATRED OF LIBERALISM WHICH
ANIMATED THE CONTINENTAL GOVERNMENTS HAD HAD THE EFFECT OF DRIVING TO
OUR SHORES A NUMBER OF MEN WHO MIGHT HAVE MADE EXCELLENT CITIZENS
WERE THEY NOT SOURED BY THE RECOLLECTION OF ALL THAT THEY HAD
UNDERGONE AMONG THESE MEN THERE WAS A STRINGENT CODE OF HONOUR ANY
INFRINGEMENT OF WHICH WAS PUNISHED BY DEATH EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE
MADE TO FIND THE SECRETARY STANGERSON AND TO ASCERTAIN SOME
PARTICULARS OF THE HABITS OF THE DECEASED A GREAT STEP HAD BEEN
GAINED BY THE DISCOVERY OF THE ADDRESS OF THE HOUSE AT WHICH HE HAD
BOARDEDA RESULT WHICH WAS ENTIRELY DUE TO THE ACUTENESS AND ENERGY
OF MR GREGSON OF SCOTLAND YARD
SHERLOCK HOLMES AND I READ THESE NOTICES OVER TOGETHER AT BREAKFAST
AND THEY APPEARED TO AFFORD HIM CONSIDERABLE AMUSEMENT
I TOLD YOU THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED LESTRADE AND GREGSON WOULD BE
SURE TO SCORE
THAT DEPENDS ON HOW IT TURNS OUT
OH BLESS YOU IT DOESNT MATTER IN THE LEAST IF THE MAN IS CAUGHT
IT WILL BE ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR EXERTIONS IF HE ESCAPES IT WILL BE
IN SPITE OF THEIR EXERTIONS ITS HEADS I WIN AND TAILS YOU LOSE
WHATEVER THEY DO THEY WILL HAVE FOLLOWERS UN SOT TROUVE TOUJOURS
UN PLUS SOT QUI LADMIRE
WHAT ON EARTH IS THIS I CRIED FOR AT THIS MOMENT THERE CAME THE
PATTERING OF MANY STEPS IN THE HALL AND ON THE STAIRS ACCOMPANIED BY
AUDIBLE EXPRESSIONS OF DISGUST UPON THE PART OF OUR LANDLADY
ITS THE BAKER STREET DIVISION OF THE DETECTIVE POLICE FORCE SAID
MY COMPANION GRAVELY AND AS HE SPOKE THERE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM
HALF A DOZEN OF THE DIRTIEST AND MOST RAGGED STREET ARABS THAT EVER I
CLAPPED EYES ON
TENTION CRIED HOLMES IN A SHARP TONE AND THE SIX DIRTY LITTLE
SCOUNDRELS STOOD IN A LINE LIKE SO MANY DISREPUTABLE STATUETTES IN
FUTURE YOU SHALL SEND UP WIGGINS ALONE TO REPORT AND THE REST OF YOU
MUST WAIT IN THE STREET HAVE YOU FOUND IT WIGGINS
NO SIR WE HAINT SAID ONE OF THE YOUTHS
I HARDLY EXPECTED YOU WOULD YOU MUST KEEP ON UNTIL YOU DO HERE ARE
YOUR WAGES HE HANDED EACH OF THEM A SHILLING NOW OFF YOU GO AND
COME BACK WITH A BETTER REPORT NEXT TIME
HE WAVED HIS HAND AND THEY SCAMPERED AWAY DOWNSTAIRS LIKE SO MANY
RATS AND WE HEARD THEIR SHRILL VOICES NEXT MOMENT IN THE STREET
THERES MORE WORK TO BE GOT OUT OF ONE OF THOSE LITTLE BEGGARS THAN
OUT OF A DOZEN OF THE FORCE HOLMES REMARKED THE MERE SIGHT OF AN
OFFICIALLOOKING PERSON SEALS MENS LIPS THESE YOUNGSTERS HOWEVER
GO EVERYWHERE AND HEAR EVERYTHING THEY ARE AS SHARP AS NEEDLES TOO
ALL THEY WANT IS ORGANISATION
IS IT ON THIS BRIXTON CASE THAT YOU ARE EMPLOYING THEM I ASKED
YES THERE IS A POINT WHICH I WISH TO ASCERTAIN IT IS MERELY A
MATTER OF TIME HULLO WE ARE GOING TO HEAR SOME NEWS NOW WITH A
VENGEANCE HERE IS GREGSON COMING DOWN THE ROAD WITH BEATITUDE
WRITTEN UPON EVERY FEATURE OF HIS FACE BOUND FOR US I KNOW YES HE
IS STOPPING THERE HE IS
THERE WAS A VIOLENT PEAL AT THE BELL AND IN A FEW SECONDS THE
FAIRHAIRED DETECTIVE CAME UP THE STAIRS THREE STEPS AT A TIME AND
BURST INTO OUR SITTINGROOM
MY DEAR FELLOW HE CRIED WRINGING HOLMES UNRESPONSIVE HAND
CONGRATULATE ME I HAVE MADE THE WHOLE THING AS CLEAR AS DAY
A SHADE OF ANXIETY SEEMED TO ME TO CROSS MY COMPANIONS EXPRESSIVE
FACE
DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK HE ASKED
THE RIGHT TRACK WHY SIR WE HAVE THE MAN UNDER LOCK AND KEY
AND HIS NAME IS
ARTHUR CHARPENTIER SUBLIEUTENANT IN HER MAJESTYS NAVY CRIED
GREGSON POMPOUSLY RUBBING HIS FAT HANDS AND INFLATING HIS CHEST
SHERLOCK HOLMES GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND RELAXED INTO A SMILE
TAKE A SEAT AND TRY ONE OF THESE CIGARS HE SAID WE ARE ANXIOUS
TO KNOW HOW YOU MANAGED IT WILL YOU HAVE SOME WHISKEY AND WATER
I DONT MIND IF I DO THE DETECTIVE ANSWERED THE TREMENDOUS
EXERTIONS WHICH I HAVE GONE THROUGH DURING THE LAST DAY OR TWO HAVE
WORN ME OUT NOT SO MUCH BODILY EXERTION YOU UNDERSTAND AS THE
STRAIN UPON THE MIND YOU WILL APPRECIATE THAT MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
FOR WE ARE BOTH BRAINWORKERS
YOU DO ME TOO MUCH HONOUR SAID HOLMES GRAVELY LET US HEAR HOW
YOU ARRIVED AT THIS MOST GRATIFYING RESULT
THE DETECTIVE SEATED HIMSELF IN THE ARMCHAIR AND PUFFED
COMPLACENTLY AT HIS CIGAR THEN SUDDENLY HE SLAPPED HIS THIGH IN A
PAROXYSM OF AMUSEMENT
THE FUN OF IT IS HE CRIED THAT THAT FOOL LESTRADE WHO THINKS
HIMSELF SO SMART HAS GONE OFF UPON THE WRONG TRACK ALTOGETHER HE IS
AFTER THE SECRETARY STANGERSON WHO HAD NO MORE TO DO WITH THE CRIME
THAN THE BABE UNBORN I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE HAS CAUGHT HIM BY THIS
TIME
THE IDEA TICKLED GREGSON SO MUCH THAT HE LAUGHED UNTIL HE CHOKED
AND HOW DID YOU GET YOUR CLUE
AH ILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT OF COURSE DOCTOR WATSON THIS IS
STRICTLY BETWEEN OURSELVES THE FIRST DIFFICULTY WHICH WE HAD TO
CONTEND WITH WAS THE FINDING OF THIS AMERICANS ANTECEDENTS SOME
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE WAITED UNTIL THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS WERE ANSWERED OR
UNTIL PARTIES CAME FORWARD AND VOLUNTEERED INFORMATION THAT IS NOT
TOBIAS GREGSONS WAY OF GOING TO WORK YOU REMEMBER THE HAT BESIDE
THE DEAD MAN
YES SAID HOLMES BY JOHN UNDERWOOD AND SONS CAMBERWELL
ROAD
GREGSON LOOKED QUITE CRESTFALLEN
I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU NOTICED THAT HE SAID HAVE YOU BEEN
THERE
NO
HA CRIED GREGSON IN A RELIEVED VOICE YOU SHOULD NEVER NEGLECT A
CHANCE HOWEVER SMALL IT MAY SEEM
TO A GREAT MIND NOTHING IS LITTLE REMARKED HOLMES SENTENTIOUSLY
WELL I WENT TO UNDERWOOD AND ASKED HIM IF HE HAD SOLD A HAT OF
THAT SIZE AND DESCRIPTION HE LOOKED OVER HIS BOOKS AND CAME ON IT
AT ONCE HE HAD SENT THE HAT TO A MR DREBBER RESIDING AT
CHARPENTIERS BOARDING ESTABLISHMENT TORQUAY TERRACE THUS I GOT AT
HIS ADDRESS
SMARTVERY SMART MURMURED SHERLOCK HOLMES
I NEXT CALLED UPON MADAME CHARPENTIER CONTINUED THE DETECTIVE I
FOUND HER VERY PALE AND DISTRESSED HER DAUGHTER WAS IN THE ROOM
TOOAN UNCOMMONLY FINE GIRL SHE IS TOO SHE WAS LOOKING RED ABOUT
THE EYES AND HER LIPS TREMBLED AS I SPOKE TO HER THAT DIDNT ESCAPE
MY NOTICE I BEGAN TO SMELL A RAT YOU KNOW THE FEELING MR SHERLOCK
HOLMES WHEN YOU COME UPON THE RIGHT SCENTA KIND OF THRILL IN YOUR
NERVES HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF YOUR LATE BOARDER
MR ENOCH J DREBBER OF CLEVELAND I ASKED
THE MOTHER NODDED SHE DIDNT SEEM ABLE TO GET OUT A WORD THE
DAUGHTER BURST INTO TEARS I FELT MORE THAN EVER THAT THESE PEOPLE
KNEW SOMETHING OF THE MATTER
AT WHAT OCLOCK DID MR DREBBER LEAVE YOUR HOUSE FOR THE TRAIN I
ASKED
AT EIGHT OCLOCK SHE SAID GULPING IN HER THROAT TO KEEP DOWN HER
AGITATION HIS SECRETARY MR STANGERSON SAID THAT THERE WERE TWO
TRAINSONE AT AND ONE AT HE WAS TO CATCH THE FIRST
AND WAS THAT THE LAST WHICH YOU SAW OF HIM
A TERRIBLE CHANGE CAME OVER THE WOMANS FACE AS I ASKED THE
QUESTION HER FEATURES TURNED PERFECTLY LIVID IT WAS SOME SECONDS
BEFORE SHE COULD GET OUT THE SINGLE WORD YESAND WHEN IT DID COME
IT WAS IN A HUSKY UNNATURAL TONE
THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN THE DAUGHTER SPOKE IN A
CALM CLEAR VOICE
NO GOOD CAN EVER COME OF FALSEHOOD MOTHER SHE SAID LET US BE
FRANK WITH THIS GENTLEMAN WE DID SEE MR DREBBER AGAIN
GOD FORGIVE YOU CRIED MADAME CHARPENTIER THROWING UP HER HANDS
AND SINKING BACK IN HER CHAIR YOU HAVE MURDERED YOUR BROTHER
ARTHUR WOULD RATHER THAT WE SPOKE THE TRUTH THE GIRL ANSWERED
FIRMLY
YOU HAD BEST TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT NOW I SAID HALFCONFIDENCES
ARE WORSE THAN NONE BESIDES YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH WE KNOW OF
IT
ON YOUR HEAD BE IT ALICE CRIED HER MOTHER AND THEN TURNING TO
ME I WILL TELL YOU ALL SIR DO NOT IMAGINE THAT MY AGITATION ON
BEHALF OF MY SON ARISES FROM ANY FEAR LEST HE SHOULD HAVE HAD A HAND
IN THIS TERRIBLE AFFAIR HE IS UTTERLY INNOCENT OF IT MY DREAD IS
HOWEVER THAT IN YOUR EYES AND IN THE EYES OF OTHERS HE MAY APPEAR TO
BE COMPROMISED THAT HOWEVER IS SURELY IMPOSSIBLE HIS HIGH
CHARACTER HIS PROFESSION HIS ANTECEDENTS WOULD ALL FORBID IT
YOUR BEST WAY IS TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF THE FACTS I ANSWERED
DEPEND UPON IT IF YOUR SON IS INNOCENT HE WILL BE NONE THE WORSE
PERHAPS ALICE YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE US TOGETHER SHE SAID AND
HER DAUGHTER WITHDREW NOW SIR SHE CONTINUED I HAD NO INTENTION
OF TELLING YOU ALL THIS BUT SINCE MY POOR DAUGHTER HAS DISCLOSED IT
I HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE HAVING ONCE DECIDED TO SPEAK I WILL TELL YOU
ALL WITHOUT OMITTING ANY PARTICULAR
IT IS YOUR WISEST COURSE SAID I
MR DREBBER HAS BEEN WITH US NEARLY THREE WEEKS HE AND HIS
SECRETARY MR STANGERSON HAD BEEN TRAVELLING ON THE CONTINENT I
NOTICED A COPENHAGEN LABEL UPON EACH OF THEIR TRUNKS SHOWING THAT
THAT HAD BEEN THEIR LAST STOPPING PLACE STANGERSON WAS A QUIET
RESERVED MAN BUT HIS EMPLOYER I AM SORRY TO SAY WAS FAR OTHERWISE
HE WAS COARSE IN HIS HABITS AND BRUTISH IN HIS WAYS THE VERY NIGHT
OF HIS ARRIVAL HE BECAME VERY MUCH THE WORSE FOR DRINK AND INDEED
AFTER TWELVE OCLOCK IN THE DAY HE COULD HARDLY EVER BE SAID TO BE
SOBER HIS MANNERS TOWARDS THE MAIDSERVANTS WERE DISGUSTINGLY FREE
AND FAMILIAR WORST OF ALL HE SPEEDILY ASSUMED THE SAME ATTITUDE
TOWARDS MY DAUGHTER ALICE AND SPOKE TO HER MORE THAN ONCE IN A WAY
WHICH FORTUNATELY SHE IS TOO INNOCENT TO UNDERSTAND ON ONE
OCCASION HE ACTUALLY SEIZED HER IN HIS ARMS AND EMBRACED HERAN
OUTRAGE WHICH CAUSED HIS OWN SECRETARY TO REPROACH HIM FOR HIS
UNMANLY CONDUCT
BUT WHY DID YOU STAND ALL THIS I ASKED I SUPPOSE THAT YOU CAN
GET RID OF YOUR BOARDERS WHEN YOU WISH
MRS CHARPENTIER BLUSHED AT MY PERTINENT QUESTION WOULD TO GOD
THAT I HAD GIVEN HIM NOTICE ON THE VERY DAY THAT HE CAME SHE SAID
BUT IT WAS A SORE TEMPTATION THEY WERE PAYING A POUND A DAY
EACHFOURTEEN POUNDS A WEEK AND THIS IS THE SLACK SEASON I AM A
WIDOW AND MY BOY IN THE NAVY HAS COST ME MUCH I GRUDGED TO LOSE THE
MONEY I ACTED FOR THE BEST THIS LAST WAS TOO MUCH HOWEVER AND I
GAVE HIM NOTICE TO LEAVE ON ACCOUNT OF IT THAT WAS THE REASON OF HIS
GOING
WELL
MY HEART GREW LIGHT WHEN I SAW HIM DRIVE AWAY MY SON IS ON LEAVE
JUST NOW BUT I DID NOT TELL HIM ANYTHING OF ALL THIS FOR HIS TEMPER
IS VIOLENT AND HE IS PASSIONATELY FOND OF HIS SISTER WHEN I CLOSED
THE DOOR BEHIND THEM A LOAD SEEMED TO BE LIFTED FROM MY MIND ALAS
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR THERE WAS A RING AT THE BELL AND I LEARNED THAT
MR DREBBER HAD RETURNED HE WAS MUCH EXCITED AND EVIDENTLY THE
WORSE FOR DRINK HE FORCED HIS WAY INTO THE ROOM WHERE I WAS SITTING
WITH MY DAUGHTER AND MADE SOME INCOHERENT REMARK ABOUT HAVING MISSED
HIS TRAIN HE THEN TURNED TO ALICE AND BEFORE MY VERY FACE PROPOSED
TO HER THAT SHE SHOULD FLY WITH HIM YOU ARE OF AGE HE SAID AND
THERE IS NO LAW TO STOP YOU I HAVE MONEY ENOUGH AND TO SPARE NEVER
MIND THE OLD GIRL HERE BUT COME ALONG WITH ME NOW STRAIGHT AWAY YOU
SHALL LIVE LIKE A PRINCESS POOR ALICE WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT SHE
SHRUNK AWAY FROM HIM BUT HE CAUGHT HER BY THE WRIST AND ENDEAVOURED
TO DRAW HER TOWARDS THE DOOR I SCREAMED AND AT THAT MOMENT MY SON
ARTHUR CAME INTO THE ROOM WHAT HAPPENED THEN I DO NOT KNOW I HEARD
OATHS AND THE CONFUSED SOUNDS OF A SCUFFLE I WAS TOO TERRIFIED TO
RAISE MY HEAD WHEN I DID LOOK UP I SAW ARTHUR STANDING IN THE
DOORWAY LAUGHING WITH A STICK IN HIS HAND I DONT THINK THAT FINE
FELLOW WILL TROUBLE US AGAIN HE SAID I WILL JUST GO AFTER HIM AND
SEE WHAT HE DOES WITH HIMSELF WITH THOSE WORDS HE TOOK HIS HAT AND
STARTED OFF DOWN THE STREET THE NEXT MORNING WE HEARD OF MR
DREBBERS MYSTERIOUS DEATH
THIS STATEMENT CAME FROM MRS CHARPENTIERS LIPS WITH MANY GASPS AND
PAUSES AT TIMES SHE SPOKE SO LOW THAT I COULD HARDLY CATCH THE
WORDS I MADE SHORTHAND NOTES OF ALL THAT SHE SAID HOWEVER SO THAT
THERE SHOULD BE NO POSSIBILITY OF A MISTAKE
ITS QUITE EXCITING SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES WITH A YAWN WHAT
HAPPENED NEXT
WHEN MRS CHARPENTIER PAUSED THE DETECTIVE CONTINUED I SAW THAT
THE WHOLE CASE HUNG UPON ONE POINT FIXING HER WITH MY EYE IN A WAY
WHICH I ALWAYS FOUND EFFECTIVE WITH WOMEN I ASKED HER AT WHAT HOUR
HER SON RETURNED
I DO NOT KNOW SHE ANSWERED
NOT KNOW
NO HE HAS A LATCHKEY AND HE LET HIMSELF IN
AFTER YOU WENT TO BED
YES
WHEN DID YOU GO TO BED
ABOUT ELEVEN
SO YOUR SON WAS GONE AT LEAST TWO HOURS
YES
POSSIBLY FOUR OR FIVE
YES
WHAT WAS HE DOING DURING THAT TIME
I DO NOT KNOW SHE ANSWERED TURNING WHITE TO HER VERY LIPS
OF COURSE AFTER THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE DONE I FOUND OUT
WHERE LIEUTENANT CHARPENTIER WAS TOOK TWO OFFICERS WITH ME AND
ARRESTED HIM WHEN I TOUCHED HIM ON THE SHOULDER AND WARNED HIM TO
COME QUIETLY WITH US HE ANSWERED US AS BOLD AS BRASS I SUPPOSE YOU
ARE ARRESTING ME FOR BEING CONCERNED IN THE DEATH OF THAT SCOUNDREL
DREBBER HE SAID WE HAD SAID NOTHING TO HIM ABOUT IT SO THAT HIS
ALLUDING TO IT HAD A MOST SUSPICIOUS ASPECT
VERY SAID HOLMES
HE STILL CARRIED THE HEAVY STICK WHICH THE MOTHER DESCRIBED HIM AS
HAVING WITH HIM WHEN HE FOLLOWED DREBBER IT WAS A STOUT OAK CUDGEL
WHAT IS YOUR THEORY THEN
WELL MY THEORY IS THAT HE FOLLOWED DREBBER AS FAR AS THE BRIXTON
ROAD WHEN THERE A FRESH ALTERCATION AROSE BETWEEN THEM IN THE
COURSE OF WHICH DREBBER RECEIVED A BLOW FROM THE STICK IN THE PIT OF
THE STOMACH PERHAPS WHICH KILLED HIM WITHOUT LEAVING ANY MARK THE
NIGHT WAS SO WET THAT NO ONE WAS ABOUT SO CHARPENTIER DRAGGED THE
BODY OF HIS VICTIM INTO THE EMPTY HOUSE AS TO THE CANDLE AND THE
BLOOD AND THE WRITING ON THE WALL AND THE RING THEY MAY ALL BE SO
MANY TRICKS TO THROW THE POLICE ON TO THE WRONG SCENT
WELL DONE SAID HOLMES IN AN ENCOURAGING VOICE REALLY GREGSON
YOU ARE GETTING ALONG WE SHALL MAKE SOMETHING OF YOU YET
I FLATTER MYSELF THAT I HAVE MANAGED IT RATHER NEATLY THE
DETECTIVE ANSWERED PROUDLY THE YOUNG MAN VOLUNTEERED A STATEMENT
IN WHICH HE SAID THAT AFTER FOLLOWING DREBBER SOME TIME THE LATTER
PERCEIVED HIM AND TOOK A CAB IN ORDER TO GET AWAY FROM HIM ON HIS
WAY HOME HE MET AN OLD SHIPMATE AND TOOK A LONG WALK WITH HIM ON
BEING ASKED WHERE THIS OLD SHIPMATE LIVED HE WAS UNABLE TO GIVE ANY
SATISFACTORY REPLY I THINK THE WHOLE CASE FITS TOGETHER UNCOMMONLY
WELL WHAT AMUSES ME IS TO THINK OF LESTRADE WHO HAD STARTED OFF
UPON THE WRONG SCENT I AM AFRAID HE WONT MAKE MUCH OFWHY BY
JOVE HERES THE VERY MAN HIMSELF
IT WAS INDEED LESTRADE WHO HAD ASCENDED THE STAIRS WHILE WE WERE
TALKING AND WHO NOW ENTERED THE ROOM THE ASSURANCE AND JAUNTINESS
WHICH GENERALLY MARKED HIS DEMEANOUR AND DRESS WERE HOWEVER
WANTING HIS FACE WAS DISTURBED AND TROUBLED WHILE HIS CLOTHES WERE
DISARRANGED AND UNTIDY HE HAD EVIDENTLY COME WITH THE INTENTION OF
CONSULTING WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR ON PERCEIVING HIS COLLEAGUE HE
APPEARED TO BE EMBARRASSED AND PUT OUT HE STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE
ROOM FUMBLING NERVOUSLY WITH HIS HAT AND UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO THIS
IS A MOST EXTRAORDINARY CASE HE SAID AT LASTA MOST
INCOMPREHENSIBLE AFFAIR
AH YOU FIND IT SO MR LESTRADE CRIED GREGSON TRIUMPHANTLY I
THOUGHT YOU WOULD COME TO THAT CONCLUSION HAVE YOU MANAGED TO FIND
THE SECRETARY MR JOSEPH STANGERSON
THE SECRETARY MR JOSEPH STANGERSON SAID LESTRADE GRAVELY WAS
MURDERED AT HALLIDAYS PRIVATE HOTEL ABOUT SIX OCLOCK THIS MORNING
CHAPTER VII
LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS
THE INTELLIGENCE WITH WHICH LESTRADE GREETED US WAS SO MOMENTOUS AND
SO UNEXPECTED THAT WE WERE ALL THREE FAIRLY DUMBFOUNDED GREGSON
SPRANG OUT OF HIS CHAIR AND UPSET THE REMAINDER OF HIS WHISKEY AND
WATER I STARED IN SILENCE AT SHERLOCK HOLMES WHOSE LIPS WERE
COMPRESSED AND HIS BROWS DRAWN DOWN OVER HIS EYES
STANGERSON TOO HE MUTTERED THE PLOT THICKENS
IT WAS QUITE THICK ENOUGH BEFORE GRUMBLED LESTRADE TAKING A
CHAIR I SEEM TO HAVE DROPPED INTO A SORT OF COUNCIL OF WAR
ARE YOUARE YOU SURE OF THIS PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE STAMMERED
GREGSON
I HAVE JUST COME FROM HIS ROOM SAID LESTRADE I WAS THE FIRST TO
DISCOVER WHAT HAD OCCURRED
WE HAVE BEEN HEARING GREGSONS VIEW OF THE MATTER HOLMES OBSERVED
WOULD YOU MIND LETTING US KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND DONE
I HAVE NO OBJECTION LESTRADE ANSWERED SEATING HIMSELF I FREELY
CONFESS THAT I WAS OF THE OPINION THAT STANGERSON WAS CONCERNED IN
THE DEATH OF DREBBER THIS FRESH DEVELOPMENT HAS SHOWN ME THAT I WAS
COMPLETELY MISTAKEN FULL OF THE ONE IDEA I SET MYSELF TO FIND OUT
WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE SECRETARY THEY HAD BEEN SEEN TOGETHER AT
EUSTON STATION ABOUT HALFPAST EIGHT ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD AT
TWO IN THE MORNING DREBBER HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE BRIXTON ROAD THE
QUESTION WHICH CONFRONTED ME WAS TO FIND OUT HOW STANGERSON HAD BEEN
EMPLOYED BETWEEN AND THE TIME OF THE CRIME AND WHAT HAD BECOME
OF HIM AFTERWARDS I TELEGRAPHED TO LIVERPOOL GIVING A DESCRIPTION
OF THE MAN AND WARNING THEM TO KEEP A WATCH UPON THE AMERICAN BOATS
I THEN SET TO WORK CALLING UPON ALL THE HOTELS AND LODGINGHOUSES IN
THE VICINITY OF EUSTON YOU SEE I ARGUED THAT IF DREBBER AND HIS
COMPANION HAD BECOME SEPARATED THE NATURAL COURSE FOR THE LATTER
WOULD BE TO PUT UP SOMEWHERE IN THE VICINITY FOR THE NIGHT AND THEN
TO HANG ABOUT THE STATION AGAIN NEXT MORNING
THEY WOULD BE LIKELY TO AGREE ON SOME MEETINGPLACE BEFOREHAND
REMARKED HOLMES
SO IT PROVED I SPENT THE WHOLE OF YESTERDAY EVENING IN MAKING
ENQUIRIES ENTIRELY WITHOUT AVAIL THIS MORNING I BEGAN VERY EARLY
AND AT EIGHT OCLOCK I REACHED HALLIDAYS PRIVATE HOTEL IN LITTLE
GEORGE STREET ON MY ENQUIRY AS TO WHETHER A MR STANGERSON WAS
LIVING THERE THEY AT ONCE ANSWERED ME IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
NO DOUBT YOU ARE THE GENTLEMAN WHOM HE WAS EXPECTING THEY SAID
HE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR A GENTLEMAN FOR TWO DAYS
WHERE IS HE NOW I ASKED
HE IS UPSTAIRS IN BED HE WISHED TO BE CALLED AT NINE
I WILL GO UP AND SEE HIM AT ONCE I SAID
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT MY SUDDEN APPEARANCE MIGHT SHAKE HIS NERVES AND
LEAD HIM TO SAY SOMETHING UNGUARDED THE BOOTS VOLUNTEERED TO SHOW ME
THE ROOM IT WAS ON THE SECOND FLOOR AND THERE WAS A SMALL CORRIDOR
LEADING UP TO IT THE BOOTS POINTED OUT THE DOOR TO ME AND WAS ABOUT
TO GO DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN WHEN I SAW SOMETHING THAT MADE ME FEEL
SICKISH IN SPITE OF MY TWENTY YEARS EXPERIENCE FROM UNDER THE DOOR
THERE CURLED A LITTLE RED RIBBON OF BLOOD WHICH HAD MEANDERED ACROSS
THE PASSAGE AND FORMED A LITTLE POOL ALONG THE SKIRTING AT THE OTHER
SIDE I GAVE A CRY WHICH BROUGHT THE BOOTS BACK HE NEARLY FAINTED
WHEN HE SAW IT THE DOOR WAS LOCKED ON THE INSIDE BUT WE PUT OUR
SHOULDERS TO IT AND KNOCKED IT IN THE WINDOW OF THE ROOM WAS OPEN
AND BESIDE THE WINDOW ALL HUDDLED UP LAY THE BODY OF A MAN IN HIS
NIGHTDRESS HE WAS QUITE DEAD AND HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME FOR HIS
LIMBS WERE RIGID AND COLD WHEN WE TURNED HIM OVER THE BOOTS
RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE AS BEING THE SAME GENTLEMAN WHO HAD ENGAGED
THE ROOM UNDER THE NAME OF JOSEPH STANGERSON THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS
A DEEP STAB IN THE LEFT SIDE WHICH MUST HAVE PENETRATED THE HEART
AND NOW COMES THE STRANGEST PART OF THE AFFAIR WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE
WAS ABOVE THE MURDERED MAN
I FELT A CREEPING OF THE FLESH AND A PRESENTIMENT OF COMING HORROR
EVEN BEFORE SHERLOCK HOLMES ANSWERED
THE WORD RACHE WRITTEN IN LETTERS OF BLOOD HE SAID
THAT WAS IT SAID LESTRADE IN AN AWESTRUCK VOICE AND WE WERE ALL
SILENT FOR A WHILE
THERE WAS SOMETHING SO METHODICAL AND SO INCOMPREHENSIBLE ABOUT THE
DEEDS OF THIS UNKNOWN ASSASSIN THAT IT IMPARTED A FRESH GHASTLINESS
TO HIS CRIMES MY NERVES WHICH WERE STEADY ENOUGH ON THE FIELD OF
BATTLE TINGLED AS I THOUGHT OF IT
THE MAN WAS SEEN CONTINUED LESTRADE A MILK BOY PASSING ON HIS
WAY TO THE DAIRY HAPPENED TO WALK DOWN THE LANE WHICH LEADS FROM THE
MEWS AT THE BACK OF THE HOTEL HE NOTICED THAT A LADDER WHICH
USUALLY LAY THERE WAS RAISED AGAINST ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE
SECOND FLOOR WHICH WAS WIDE OPEN AFTER PASSING HE LOOKED BACK AND
SAW A MAN DESCEND THE LADDER HE CAME DOWN SO QUIETLY AND OPENLY THAT
THE BOY IMAGINED HIM TO BE SOME CARPENTER OR JOINER AT WORK IN THE
HOTEL HE TOOK NO PARTICULAR NOTICE OF HIM BEYOND THINKING IN HIS
OWN MIND THAT IT WAS EARLY FOR HIM TO BE AT WORK HE HAS AN
IMPRESSION THAT THE MAN WAS TALL HAD A REDDISH FACE AND WAS DRESSED
IN A LONG BROWNISH COAT HE MUST HAVE STAYED IN THE ROOM SOME LITTLE
TIME AFTER THE MURDER FOR WE FOUND BLOODSTAINED WATER IN THE BASIN
WHERE HE HAD WASHED HIS HANDS AND MARKS ON THE SHEETS WHERE HE HAD
DELIBERATELY WIPED HIS KNIFE
I GLANCED AT HOLMES ON HEARING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE MURDERER WHICH
TALLIED SO EXACTLY WITH HIS OWN THERE WAS HOWEVER NO TRACE OF
EXULTATION OR SATISFACTION UPON HIS FACE
DID YOU FIND NOTHING IN THE ROOM WHICH COULD FURNISH A CLUE TO THE
MURDERER HE ASKED
NOTHING STANGERSON HAD DREBBERS PURSE IN HIS POCKET BUT IT SEEMS
THAT THIS WAS USUAL AS HE DID ALL THE PAYING THERE WAS EIGHTY ODD
POUNDS IN IT BUT NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN WHATEVER THE MOTIVES OF
THESE EXTRAORDINARY CRIMES ROBBERY IS CERTAINLY NOT ONE OF THEM
THERE WERE NO PAPERS OR MEMORANDA IN THE MURDERED MANS POCKET
EXCEPT A SINGLE TELEGRAM DATED FROM CLEVELAND ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND
CONTAINING THE WORDS J H IS IN EUROPE THERE WAS NO NAME
APPENDED TO THIS MESSAGE
AND THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE HOLMES ASKED
NOTHING OF ANY IMPORTANCE THE MANS NOVEL WITH WHICH HE HAD READ
HIMSELF TO SLEEP WAS LYING UPON THE BED AND HIS PIPE WAS ON A CHAIR
BESIDE HIM THERE WAS A GLASS OF WATER ON THE TABLE AND ON THE
WINDOWSILL A SMALL CHIP OINTMENT BOX CONTAINING A COUPLE OF PILLS
SHERLOCK HOLMES SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF DELIGHT
THE LAST LINK HE CRIED EXULTANTLY MY CASE IS COMPLETE
THE TWO DETECTIVES STARED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT
I HAVE NOW IN MY HANDS MY COMPANION SAID CONFIDENTLY ALL THE
THREADS WHICH HAVE FORMED SUCH A TANGLE THERE ARE OF COURSE
DETAILS TO BE FILLED IN BUT I AM AS CERTAIN OF ALL THE MAIN FACTS
FROM THE TIME THAT DREBBER PARTED FROM STANGERSON AT THE STATION UP
TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE BODY OF THE LATTER AS IF I HAD SEEN THEM
WITH MY OWN EYES I WILL GIVE YOU A PROOF OF MY KNOWLEDGE COULD YOU
LAY YOUR HAND UPON THOSE PILLS
I HAVE THEM SAID LESTRADE PRODUCING A SMALL WHITE BOX I TOOK
THEM AND THE PURSE AND THE TELEGRAM INTENDING TO HAVE THEM PUT IN A
PLACE OF SAFETY AT THE POLICE STATION IT WAS THE MEREST CHANCE MY
TAKING THESE PILLS FOR I AM BOUND TO SAY THAT I DO NOT ATTACH ANY
IMPORTANCE TO THEM
GIVE THEM HERE SAID HOLMES NOW DOCTOR TURNING TO ME ARE
THOSE ORDINARY PILLS
THEY CERTAINLY WERE NOT THEY WERE OF A PEARLY GREY COLOUR SMALL
ROUND AND ALMOST TRANSPARENT AGAINST THE LIGHT FROM THEIR
LIGHTNESS AND TRANSPARENCY I SHOULD IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE SOLUBLE IN
WATER I REMARKED
PRECISELY SO ANSWERED HOLMES NOW WOULD YOU MIND GOING DOWN AND
FETCHING THAT POOR LITTLE DEVIL OF A TERRIER WHICH HAS BEEN BAD SO
LONG AND WHICH THE LANDLADY WANTED YOU TO PUT OUT OF ITS PAIN
YESTERDAY
I WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND CARRIED THE DOG UPSTAIR IN MY ARMS ITS
LABOURED BREATHING AND GLAZING EYE SHOWED THAT IT WAS NOT FAR FROM
ITS END INDEED ITS SNOWWHITE MUZZLE PROCLAIMED THAT IT HAD ALREADY
EXCEEDED THE USUAL TERM OF CANINE EXISTENCE I PLACED IT UPON A
CUSHION ON THE RUG
I WILL NOW CUT ONE OF THESE PILLS IN TWO SAID HOLMES AND DRAWING
HIS PENKNIFE HE SUITED THE ACTION TO THE WORD ONE HALF WE RETURN
INTO THE BOX FOR FUTURE PURPOSES THE OTHER HALF I WILL PLACE IN THIS
WINE GLASS IN WHICH IS A TEASPOONFUL OF WATER YOU PERCEIVE THAT OUR
FRIEND THE DOCTOR IS RIGHT AND THAT IT READILY DISSOLVES
THIS MAY BE VERY INTERESTING SAID LESTRADE IN THE INJURED TONE OF
ONE WHO SUSPECTS THAT HE IS BEING LAUGHED AT I CANNOT SEE HOWEVER
WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH THE DEATH OF MR JOSEPH STANGERSON
PATIENCE MY FRIEND PATIENCE YOU WILL FIND IN TIME THAT IT HAS
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH IT I SHALL NOW ADD A LITTLE MILK TO MAKE THE
MIXTURE PALATABLE AND ON PRESENTING IT TO THE DOG WE FIND THAT HE
LAPS IT UP READILY ENOUGH
AS HE SPOKE HE TURNED THE CONTENTS OF THE WINE GLASS INTO A SAUCER
AND PLACED IT IN FRONT OF THE TERRIER WHO SPEEDILY LICKED IT DRY
SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNEST DEMEANOUR HAD SO FAR CONVINCED US THAT WE
ALL SAT IN SILENCE WATCHING THE ANIMAL INTENTLY AND EXPECTING SOME
STARTLING EFFECT NONE SUCH APPEARED HOWEVER THE DOG CONTINUED TO
LIE STRETCHED UPON THE CUSHION BREATHING IN A LABOURED WAY BUT
APPARENTLY NEITHER THE BETTER NOR THE WORSE FOR ITS DRAUGHT
HOLMES HAD TAKEN OUT HIS WATCH AND AS MINUTE FOLLOWED MINUTE WITHOUT
RESULT AN EXPRESSION OF THE UTMOST CHAGRIN AND DISAPPOINTMENT
APPEARED UPON HIS FEATURES HE GNAWED HIS LIP DRUMMED HIS FINGERS
UPON THE TABLE AND SHOWED EVERY OTHER SYMPTOM OF ACUTE IMPATIENCE
SO GREAT WAS HIS EMOTION THAT I FELT SINCERELY SORRY FOR HIM WHILE
THE TWO DETECTIVES SMILED DERISIVELY BY NO MEANS DISPLEASED AT THIS
CHECK WHICH HE HAD MET
IT CANT BE A COINCIDENCE HE CRIED AT LAST SPRINGING FROM HIS
CHAIR AND PACING WILDLY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT
IT SHOULD BE A MERE COINCIDENCE THE VERY PILLS WHICH I SUSPECTED IN
THE CASE OF DREBBER ARE ACTUALLY FOUND AFTER THE DEATH OF STANGERSON
AND YET THEY ARE INERT WHAT CAN IT MEAN SURELY MY WHOLE CHAIN OF
REASONING CANNOT HAVE BEEN FALSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND YET THIS
WRETCHED DOG IS NONE THE WORSE AH I HAVE IT I HAVE IT WITH A
PERFECT SHRIEK OF DELIGHT HE RUSHED TO THE BOX CUT THE OTHER PILL IN
TWO DISSOLVED IT ADDED MILK AND PRESENTED IT TO THE TERRIER THE
UNFORTUNATE CREATURES TONGUE SEEMED HARDLY TO HAVE BEEN MOISTENED IN
IT BEFORE IT GAVE A CONVULSIVE SHIVER IN EVERY LIMB AND LAY AS RIGID
AND LIFELESS AS IF IT HAD BEEN STRUCK BY LIGHTNING
SHERLOCK HOLMES DREW A LONG BREATH AND WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM
HIS FOREHEAD I SHOULD HAVE MORE FAITH HE SAID I OUGHT TO KNOW
BY THIS TIME THAT WHEN A FACT APPEARS TO BE OPPOSED TO A LONG TRAIN
OF DEDUCTIONS IT INVARIABLY PROVES TO BE CAPABLE OF BEARING SOME
OTHER INTERPRETATION OF THE TWO PILLS IN THAT BOX ONE WAS OF THE
MOST DEADLY POISON AND THE OTHER WAS ENTIRELY HARMLESS I OUGHT TO
HAVE KNOWN THAT BEFORE EVER I SAW THE BOX AT ALL
THIS LAST STATEMENT APPEARED TO ME TO BE SO STARTLING THAT I COULD
HARDLY BELIEVE THAT HE WAS IN HIS SOBER SENSES THERE WAS THE DEAD
DOG HOWEVER TO PROVE THAT HIS CONJECTURE HAD BEEN CORRECT IT
SEEMED TO ME THAT THE MISTS IN MY OWN MIND WERE GRADUALLY CLEARING
AWAY AND I BEGAN TO HAVE A DIM VAGUE PERCEPTION OF THE TRUTH
ALL THIS SEEMS STRANGE TO YOU CONTINUED HOLMES BECAUSE YOU
FAILED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE INQUIRY TO GRASP THE IMPORTANCE OF THE
SINGLE REAL CLUE WHICH WAS PRESENTED TO YOU I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE
TO SEIZE UPON THAT AND EVERYTHING WHICH HAS OCCURRED SINCE THEN HAS
SERVED TO CONFIRM MY ORIGINAL SUPPOSITION AND INDEED WAS THE
LOGICAL SEQUENCE OF IT HENCE THINGS WHICH HAVE PERPLEXED YOU AND
MADE THE CASE MORE OBSCURE HAVE SERVED TO ENLIGHTEN ME AND TO
STRENGTHEN MY CONCLUSIONS IT IS A MISTAKE TO CONFOUND STRANGENESS
WITH MYSTERY THE MOST COMMONPLACE CRIME IS OFTEN THE MOST MYSTERIOUS
BECAUSE IT PRESENTS NO NEW OR SPECIAL FEATURES FROM WHICH DEDUCTIONS
MAY BE DRAWN THIS MURDER WOULD HAVE BEEN INFINITELY MORE DIFFICULT
TO UNRAVEL HAD THE BODY OF THE VICTIM BEEN SIMPLY FOUND LYING IN THE
ROADWAY WITHOUT ANY OF THOSE OUTR AND SENSATIONAL ACCOMPANIMENTS
WHICH HAVE RENDERED IT REMARKABLE THESE STRANGE DETAILS FAR FROM
MAKING THE CASE MORE DIFFICULT HAVE REALLY HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING
IT LESS SO
MR GREGSON WHO HAD LISTENED TO THIS ADDRESS WITH CONSIDERABLE
IMPATIENCE COULD CONTAIN HIMSELF NO LONGER LOOK HERE MR SHERLOCK
HOLMES HE SAID WE ARE ALL READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE A
SMART MAN AND THAT YOU HAVE YOUR OWN METHODS OF WORKING WE WANT
SOMETHING MORE THAN MERE THEORY AND PREACHING NOW THOUGH IT IS A
CASE OF TAKING THE MAN I HAVE MADE MY CASE OUT AND IT SEEMS I WAS
WRONG YOUNG CHARPENTIER COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS SECOND
AFFAIR LESTRADE WENT AFTER HIS MAN STANGERSON AND IT APPEARS THAT
HE WAS WRONG TOO YOU HAVE THROWN OUT HINTS HERE AND HINTS THERE
AND SEEM TO KNOW MORE THAN WE DO BUT THE TIME HAS COME WHEN WE FEEL
THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO ASK YOU STRAIGHT HOW MUCH YOU DO KNOW OF THE
BUSINESS CAN YOU NAME THE MAN WHO DID IT
I CANNOT HELP FEELING THAT GREGSON IS RIGHT SIR REMARKED
LESTRADE WE HAVE BOTH TRIED AND WE HAVE BOTH FAILED YOU HAVE
REMARKED MORE THAN ONCE SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOM THAT YOU HAD
ALL THE EVIDENCE WHICH YOU REQUIRE SURELY YOU WILL NOT WITHHOLD IT
ANY LONGER
ANY DELAY IN ARRESTING THE ASSASSIN I OBSERVED MIGHT GIVE HIM
TIME TO PERPETRATE SOME FRESH ATROCITY
THUS PRESSED BY US ALL HOLMES SHOWED SIGNS OF IRRESOLUTION HE
CONTINUED TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WITH HIS HEAD SUNK ON HIS
CHEST AND HIS BROWS DRAWN DOWN AS WAS HIS HABIT WHEN LOST IN
THOUGHT
THERE WILL BE NO MORE MURDERS HE SAID AT LAST STOPPING ABRUPTLY
AND FACING US YOU CAN PUT THAT CONSIDERATION OUT OF THE QUESTION
YOU HAVE ASKED ME IF I KNOW THE NAME OF THE ASSASSIN I DO THE MERE
KNOWING OF HIS NAME IS A SMALL THING HOWEVER COMPARED WITH THE
POWER OF LAYING OUR HANDS UPON HIM THIS I EXPECT VERY SHORTLY TO DO
I HAVE GOOD HOPES OF MANAGING IT THROUGH MY OWN ARRANGEMENTS BUT IT
IS A THING WHICH NEEDS DELICATE HANDLING FOR WE HAVE A SHREWD AND
DESPERATE MAN TO DEAL WITH WHO IS SUPPORTED AS I HAVE HAD OCCASION
TO PROVE BY ANOTHER WHO IS AS CLEVER AS HIMSELF AS LONG AS THIS MAN
HAS NO IDEA THAT ANYONE CAN HAVE A CLUE THERE IS SOME CHANCE OF
SECURING HIM BUT IF HE HAD THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION HE WOULD CHANGE
HIS NAME AND VANISH IN AN INSTANT AMONG THE FOUR MILLION INHABITANTS
OF THIS GREAT CITY WITHOUT MEANING TO HURT EITHER OF YOUR FEELINGS
I AM BOUND TO SAY THAT I CONSIDER THESE MEN TO BE MORE THAN A MATCH
FOR THE OFFICIAL FORCE AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE NOT ASKED YOUR
ASSISTANCE IF I FAIL I SHALL OF COURSE INCUR ALL THE BLAME DUE TO
THIS OMISSION BUT THAT I AM PREPARED FOR AT PRESENT I AM READY TO
PROMISE THAT THE INSTANT THAT I CAN COMMUNICATE WITH YOU WITHOUT
ENDANGERING MY OWN COMBINATIONS I SHALL DO SO
GREGSON AND LESTRADE SEEMED TO BE FAR FROM SATISFIED BY THIS
ASSURANCE OR BY THE DEPRECIATING ALLUSION TO THE DETECTIVE POLICE
THE FORMER HAD FLUSHED UP TO THE ROOTS OF HIS FLAXEN HAIR WHILE THE
OTHERS BEADY EYES GLISTENED WITH CURIOSITY AND RESENTMENT NEITHER
OF THEM HAD TIME TO SPEAK HOWEVER BEFORE THERE WAS A TAP AT THE
DOOR AND THE SPOKESMAN OF THE STREET ARABS YOUNG WIGGINS
INTRODUCED HIS INSIGNIFICANT AND UNSAVOURY PERSON
PLEASE SIR HE SAID TOUCHING HIS FORELOCK I HAVE THE CAB
DOWNSTAIRS
GOOD BOY SAID HOLMES BLANDLY WHY DONT YOU INTRODUCE THIS
PATTERN AT SCOTLAND YARD HE CONTINUED TAKING A PAIR OF STEEL
HANDCUFFS FROM A DRAWER SEE HOW BEAUTIFULLY THE SPRING WORKS THEY
FASTEN IN AN INSTANT
THE OLD PATTERN IS GOOD ENOUGH REMARKED LESTRADE IF WE CAN ONLY
FIND THE MAN TO PUT THEM ON
VERY GOOD VERY GOOD SAID HOLMES SMILING THE CABMAN MAY AS WELL
HELP ME WITH MY BOXES JUST ASK HIM TO STEP UP WIGGINS
I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND MY COMPANION SPEAKING AS THOUGH HE WERE ABOUT
TO SET OUT ON A JOURNEY SINCE HE HAD NOT SAID ANYTHING TO ME ABOUT
IT THERE WAS A SMALL PORTMANTEAU IN THE ROOM AND THIS HE PULLED OUT
AND BEGAN TO STRAP HE WAS BUSILY ENGAGED AT IT WHEN THE CABMAN
ENTERED THE ROOM
JUST GIVE ME A HELP WITH THIS BUCKLE CABMAN HE SAID KNEELING
OVER HIS TASK AND NEVER TURNING HIS HEAD
THE FELLOW CAME FORWARD WITH A SOMEWHAT SULLEN DEFIANT AIR AND PUT
DOWN HIS HANDS TO ASSIST AT THAT INSTANT THERE WAS A SHARP CLICK
THE JANGLING OF METAL AND SHERLOCK HOLMES SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN
GENTLEMEN HE CRIED WITH FLASHING EYES LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO
MR JEFFERSON HOPE THE MURDERER OF ENOCH DREBBER AND OF JOSEPH
STANGERSON
THE WHOLE THING OCCURRED IN A MOMENTSO QUICKLY THAT I HAD NO TIME
TO REALIZE IT I HAVE A VIVID RECOLLECTION OF THAT INSTANT OF
HOLMES TRIUMPHANT EXPRESSION AND THE RING OF HIS VOICE OF THE
CABMANS DAZED SAVAGE FACE AS HE GLARED AT THE GLITTERING
HANDCUFFS WHICH HAD APPEARED AS IF BY MAGIC UPON HIS WRISTS FOR A
SECOND OR TWO WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GROUP OF STATUES THEN WITH AN
INARTICULATE ROAR OF FURY THE PRISONER WRENCHED HIMSELF FREE FROM
HOLMESS GRASP AND HURLED HIMSELF THROUGH THE WINDOW WOODWORK AND
GLASS GAVE WAY BEFORE HIM BUT BEFORE HE GOT QUITE THROUGH GREGSON
LESTRADE AND HOLMES SPRANG UPON HIM LIKE SO MANY STAGHOUNDS HE WAS
DRAGGED BACK INTO THE ROOM AND THEN COMMENCED A TERRIFIC CONFLICT
SO POWERFUL AND SO FIERCE WAS HE THAT THE FOUR OF US WERE SHAKEN OFF
AGAIN AND AGAIN HE APPEARED TO HAVE THE CONVULSIVE STRENGTH OF A MAN
IN AN EPILEPTIC FIT HIS FACE AND HANDS WERE TERRIBLY MANGLED BY HIS
PASSAGE THROUGH THE GLASS BUT LOSS OF BLOOD HAD NO EFFECT IN
DIMINISHING HIS RESISTANCE IT WAS NOT UNTIL LESTRADE SUCCEEDED IN
GETTING HIS HAND INSIDE HIS NECKCLOTH AND HALFSTRANGLING HIM THAT WE
MADE HIM REALIZE THAT HIS STRUGGLES WERE OF NO AVAIL AND EVEN THEN
WE FELT NO SECURITY UNTIL WE HAD PINIONED HIS FEET AS WELL AS HIS
HANDS THAT DONE WE ROSE TO OUR FEET BREATHLESS AND PANTING
WE HAVE HIS CAB SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES IT WILL SERVE TO TAKE HIM
TO SCOTLAND YARD AND NOW GENTLEMEN HE CONTINUED WITH A PLEASANT
SMILE WE HAVE REACHED THE END OF OUR LITTLE MYSTERY YOU ARE VERY
WELCOME TO PUT ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU LIKE TO ME NOW AND THERE IS NO
DANGER THAT I WILL REFUSE TO ANSWER THEM
PART II
THE COUNTRY OF THE SAINTS
CHAPTER I
ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN
IN THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE GREAT NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT THERE
LIES AN ARID AND REPULSIVE DESERT WHICH FOR MANY A LONG YEAR SERVED
AS A BARRIER AGAINST THE ADVANCE OF CIVILISATION FROM THE SIERRA
NEVADA TO NEBRASKA AND FROM THE YELLOWSTONE RIVER IN THE NORTH TO
THE COLORADO UPON THE SOUTH IS A REGION OF DESOLATION AND SILENCE
NOR IS NATURE ALWAYS IN ONE MOOD THROUGHOUT THIS GRIM DISTRICT IT
COMPRISES SNOWCAPPED AND LOFTY MOUNTAINS AND DARK AND GLOOMY
VALLEYS THERE ARE SWIFTFLOWING RIVERS WHICH DASH THROUGH JAGGED
CAONS AND THERE ARE ENORMOUS PLAINS WHICH IN WINTER ARE WHITE WITH
SNOW AND IN SUMMER ARE GREY WITH THE SALINE ALKALI DUST THEY ALL
PRESERVE HOWEVER THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF BARRENNESS
INHOSPITALITY AND MISERY
THERE ARE NO INHABITANTS OF THIS LAND OF DESPAIR A BAND OF PAWNEES
OR OF BLACKFEET MAY OCCASIONALLY TRAVERSE IT IN ORDER TO REACH OTHER
HUNTINGGROUNDS BUT THE HARDIEST OF THE BRAVES ARE GLAD TO LOSE
SIGHT OF THOSE AWESOME PLAINS AND TO FIND THEMSELVES ONCE MORE UPON
THEIR PRAIRIES THE COYOTE SKULKS AMONG THE SCRUB THE BUZZARD FLAPS
HEAVILY THROUGH THE AIR AND THE CLUMSY GRIZZLY BEAR LUMBERS THROUGH
THE DARK RAVINES AND PICKS UP SUCH SUSTENANCE AS IT CAN AMONGST THE
ROCKS THESE ARE THE SOLE DWELLERS IN THE WILDERNESS
IN THE WHOLE WORLD THERE CAN BE NO MORE DREARY VIEW THAN THAT FROM
THE NORTHERN SLOPE OF THE SIERRA BLANCO AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN REACH
STRETCHES THE GREAT FLAT PLAINLAND ALL DUSTED OVER WITH PATCHES OF
ALKALI AND INTERSECTED BY CLUMPS OF THE DWARFISH CHAPARRAL BUSHES
ON THE EXTREME VERGE OF THE HORIZON LIE A LONG CHAIN OF MOUNTAIN
PEAKS WITH THEIR RUGGED SUMMITS FLECKED WITH SNOW IN THIS GREAT
STRETCH OF COUNTRY THERE IS NO SIGN OF LIFE NOR OF ANYTHING
APPERTAINING TO LIFE THERE IS NO BIRD IN THE STEELBLUE HEAVEN NO
MOVEMENT UPON THE DULL GREY EARTHABOVE ALL THERE IS ABSOLUTE
SILENCE LISTEN AS ONE MAY THERE IS NO SHADOW OF A SOUND IN ALL THAT
MIGHTY WILDERNESS NOTHING BUT SILENCECOMPLETE AND HEARTSUBDUING
SILENCE
IT HAS BEEN SAID THERE IS NOTHING APPERTAINING TO LIFE UPON THE BROAD
PLAIN THAT IS HARDLY TRUE LOOKING DOWN FROM THE SIERRA BLANCO ONE
SEES A PATHWAY TRACED OUT ACROSS THE DESERT WHICH WINDS AWAY AND IS
LOST IN THE EXTREME DISTANCE IT IS RUTTED WITH WHEELS AND TRODDEN
DOWN BY THE FEET OF MANY ADVENTURERS HERE AND THERE THERE ARE
SCATTERED WHITE OBJECTS WHICH GLISTEN IN THE SUN AND STAND OUT
AGAINST THE DULL DEPOSIT OF ALKALI APPROACH AND EXAMINE THEM THEY
ARE BONES SOME LARGE AND COARSE OTHERS SMALLER AND MORE DELICATE
THE FORMER HAVE BELONGED TO OXEN AND THE LATTER TO MEN FOR FIFTEEN
HUNDRED MILES ONE MAY TRACE THIS GHASTLY CARAVAN ROUTE BY THESE
SCATTERED REMAINS OF THOSE WHO HAD FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE
LOOKING DOWN ON THIS VERY SCENE THERE STOOD UPON THE FOURTH OF MAY
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTYSEVEN A SOLITARY TRAVELLER HIS
APPEARANCE WAS SUCH THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE VERY GENIUS OR DEMON
OF THE REGION AN OBSERVER WOULD HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO SAY
WHETHER HE WAS NEARER TO FORTY OR TO SIXTY HIS FACE WAS LEAN AND
HAGGARD AND THE BROWN PARCHMENTLIKE SKIN WAS DRAWN TIGHTLY OVER THE
PROJECTING BONES HIS LONG BROWN HAIR AND BEARD WERE ALL FLECKED AND
DASHED WITH WHITE HIS EYES WERE SUNKEN IN HIS HEAD AND BURNED WITH
AN UNNATURAL LUSTRE WHILE THE HAND WHICH GRASPED HIS RIFLE WAS
HARDLY MORE FLESHY THAN THAT OF A SKELETON AS HE STOOD HE LEANED
UPON HIS WEAPON FOR SUPPORT AND YET HIS TALL FIGURE AND THE MASSIVE
FRAMEWORK OF HIS BONES SUGGESTED A WIRY AND VIGOROUS CONSTITUTION
HIS GAUNT FACE HOWEVER AND HIS CLOTHES WHICH HUNG SO BAGGILY OVER
HIS SHRIVELLED LIMBS PROCLAIMED WHAT IT WAS THAT GAVE HIM THAT
SENILE AND DECREPIT APPEARANCE THE MAN WAS DYINGDYING FROM HUNGER
AND FROM THIRST
HE HAD TOILED PAINFULLY DOWN THE RAVINE AND ON TO THIS LITTLE
ELEVATION IN THE VAIN HOPE OF SEEING SOME SIGNS OF WATER NOW THE
GREAT SALT PLAIN STRETCHED BEFORE HIS EYES AND THE DISTANT BELT OF
SAVAGE MOUNTAINS WITHOUT A SIGN ANYWHERE OF PLANT OR TREE WHICH
MIGHT INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF MOISTURE IN ALL THAT BROAD LANDSCAPE
THERE WAS NO GLEAM OF HOPE NORTH AND EAST AND WEST HE LOOKED WITH
WILD QUESTIONING EYES AND THEN HE REALISED THAT HIS WANDERINGS HAD
COME TO AN END AND THAT THERE ON THAT BARREN CRAG HE WAS ABOUT TO
DIE WHY NOT HERE AS WELL AS IN A FEATHER BED TWENTY YEARS HENCE
HE MUTTERED AS HE SEATED HIMSELF IN THE SHELTER OF A BOULDER
BEFORE SITTING DOWN HE HAD DEPOSITED UPON THE GROUND HIS USELESS
RIFLE AND ALSO A LARGE BUNDLE TIED UP IN A GREY SHAWL WHICH HE HAD
CARRIED SLUNG OVER HIS RIGHT SHOULDER IT APPEARED TO BE SOMEWHAT TOO
HEAVY FOR HIS STRENGTH FOR IN LOWERING IT IT CAME DOWN ON THE
GROUND WITH SOME LITTLE VIOLENCE INSTANTLY THERE BROKE FROM THE GREY
PARCEL A LITTLE MOANING CRY AND FROM IT THERE PROTRUDED A SMALL
SCARED FACE WITH VERY BRIGHT BROWN EYES AND TWO LITTLE SPECKLED
DIMPLED FISTS
YOUVE HURT ME SAID A CHILDISH VOICE REPROACHFULLY
HAVE I THOUGH THE MAN ANSWERED PENITENTLY I DIDNT GO FOR TO DO
IT AS HE SPOKE HE UNWRAPPED THE GREY SHAWL AND EXTRICATED A PRETTY
LITTLE GIRL OF ABOUT FIVE YEARS OF AGE WHOSE DAINTY SHOES AND SMART
PINK FROCK WITH ITS LITTLE LINEN APRON ALL BESPOKE A MOTHERS CARE
THE CHILD WAS PALE AND WAN BUT HER HEALTHY ARMS AND LEGS SHOWED THAT
SHE HAD SUFFERED LESS THAN HER COMPANION

CHANCE OF WATER IN THIS DIRECTION SO I HEAVED YOU OVER MY SHOULDER
AND WE TRAMPED IT TOGETHER IT DONT SEEM AS THOUGH WEVE IMPROVED
MATTERS THERES AN ALMIGHTY SMALL CHANCE FOR US NOW
DO YOU MEAN THAT WE ARE GOING TO DIE TOO ASKED THE CHILD CHECKING
HER SOBS AND RAISING HER TEARSTAINED FACE

MEETS US AT THE DOOR OF HEAVEN WITH A BIG PITCHER OF WATER AND A LOT
OF BUCKWHEAT CAKES HOT AND TOASTED ON BOTH SIDES LIKE BOB AND ME
WAS FOND OF HOW LONG WILL IT BE FIRST
I DONT KNOWNOT VERY LONG THE MANS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THE
NORTHERN HORIZON IN THE BLUE VAULT OF THE HEAVEN THERE HAD APPEARED
THREE LITTLE SPECKS WHICH INCREASED IN SIZE EVERY MOMENT SO RAPIDLY
DID THEY APPROACH THEY SPEEDILY RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO THREE LARGE
BROWN BIRDS WHICH CIRCLED OVER THE HEADS OF THE TWO WANDERERS AND
THEN SETTLED UPON SOME ROCKS WHICH OVERLOOKED THEM THEY WERE
BUZZARDS THE VULTURES OF THE WEST WHOSE COMING IS THE FORERUNNER OF
DEATH
COCKS AND HENS CRIED THE LITTLE GIRL GLEEFULLY POINTING AT THEIR
ILLOMENED FORMS AND CLAPPING HER HANDS TO MAKE THEM RISE SAY DID
GOD MAKE THIS COUNTRY
OF COURSE HE DID SAID HER COMPANION RATHER STARTLED BY THIS
UNEXPECTED QUESTION
HE MADE THE COUNTRY DOWN IN ILLINOIS AND HE MADE THE MISSOURI THE
LITTLE GIRL CONTINUED I GUESS SOMEBODY ELSE MADE THE COUNTRY IN
THESE PARTS ITS NOT NEARLY SO WELL DONE THEY FORGOT THE WATER AND
THE TREES
WHAT WOULD YE THINK OF OFFERING UP PRAYER THE MAN ASKED
DIFFIDENTLY
IT AINT NIGHT YET SHE ANSWERED
IT DONT MATTER IT AINT QUITE REGULAR BUT HE WONT MIND THAT YOU
BET YOU SAY OVER THEM ONES THAT YOU USED TO SAY EVERY NIGHT IN THE
WAGGON WHEN WE WAS ON THE PLAINS
WHY DONT YOU SAY SOME YOURSELF THE CHILD ASKED WITH WONDERING
EYES
I DISREMEMBER THEM HE ANSWERED I HAINT SAID NONE SINCE I WAS
HALF THE HEIGHT O THAT GUN I GUESS ITS NEVER TOO LATE YOU SAY
THEM OUT AND ILL STAND BY AND COME IN ON THE CHORUSES
THEN YOULL NEED TO KNEEL DOWN AND ME TOO SHE SAID LAYING THE
SHAWL OUT FOR THAT PURPOSE YOUVE GOT TO PUT YOUR HANDS UP LIKE
THIS IT MAKES YOU FEEL KIND O GOOD
IT WAS A STRANGE SIGHT HAD THERE BEEN ANYTHING BUT THE BUZZARDS TO
SEE IT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE NARROW SHAWL KNELT THE TWO WANDERERS THE
LITTLE PRATTLING CHILD AND THE RECKLESS HARDENED ADVENTURER HER
CHUBBY FACE AND HIS HAGGARD ANGULAR VISAGE WERE BOTH TURNED UP TO
THE CLOUDLESS HEAVEN IN HEARTFELT ENTREATY TO THAT DREAD BEING WITH
WHOM THEY WERE FACE TO FACE WHILE THE TWO VOICESTHE ONE THIN AND
CLEAR THE OTHER DEEP AND HARSHUNITED IN THE ENTREATY FOR MERCY AND
FORGIVENESS THE PRAYER FINISHED THEY RESUMED THEIR SEAT IN THE
SHADOW OF THE BOULDER UNTIL THE CHILD FELL ASLEEP NESTLING UPON THE
BROAD BREAST OF HER PROTECTOR HE WATCHED OVER HER SLUMBER FOR SOME
TIME BUT NATURE PROVED TO BE TOO STRONG FOR HIM FOR THREE DAYS AND
THREE NIGHTS HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF NEITHER REST NOR REPOSE SLOWLY
THE EYELIDS DROOPED OVER THE TIRED EYES AND THE HEAD SUNK LOWER AND
LOWER UPON THE BREAST UNTIL THE MANS GRIZZLED BEARD WAS MIXED WITH
THE GOLD TRESSES OF HIS COMPANION AND BOTH SLEPT THE SAME DEEP AND
DREAMLESS SLUMBER
HAD THE WANDERER REMAINED AWAKE FOR ANOTHER HALF HOUR A STRANGE SIGHT
WOULD HAVE MET HIS EYES FAR AWAY ON THE EXTREME VERGE OF THE ALKALI
PLAIN THERE ROSE UP A LITTLE SPRAY OF DUST VERY SLIGHT AT FIRST AND
HARDLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE MISTS OF THE DISTANCE BUT
GRADUALLY GROWING HIGHER AND BROADER UNTIL IT FORMED A SOLID
WELLDEFINED CLOUD THIS CLOUD CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN SIZE UNTIL IT
BECAME EVIDENT THAT IT COULD ONLY BE RAISED BY A GREAT MULTITUDE OF
MOVING CREATURES IN MORE FERTILE SPOTS THE OBSERVER WOULD HAVE COME
TO THE CONCLUSION THAT ONE OF THOSE GREAT HERDS OF BISONS WHICH GRAZE
UPON THE PRAIRIE LAND WAS APPROACHING HIM THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY
IMPOSSIBLE IN THESE ARID WILDS AS THE WHIRL OF DUST DREW NEARER TO
THE SOLITARY BLUFF UPON WHICH THE TWO CASTAWAYS WERE REPOSING THE
CANVASCOVERED TILTS OF WAGGONS AND THE FIGURES OF ARMED HORSEMEN
BEGAN TO SHOW UP THROUGH THE HAZE AND THE APPARITION REVEALED ITSELF
AS BEING A GREAT CARAVAN UPON ITS JOURNEY FOR THE WEST BUT WHAT A
CARAVAN WHEN THE HEAD OF IT HAD REACHED THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAINS
THE REAR WAS NOT YET VISIBLE ON THE HORIZON RIGHT ACROSS THE
ENORMOUS PLAIN STRETCHED THE STRAGGLING ARRAY WAGGONS AND CARTS MEN
ON HORSEBACK AND MEN ON FOOT INNUMERABLE WOMEN WHO STAGGERED ALONG
UNDER BURDENS AND CHILDREN WHO TODDLED BESIDE THE WAGGONS OR PEEPED
OUT FROM UNDER THE WHITE COVERINGS THIS WAS EVIDENTLY NO ORDINARY
PARTY OF IMMIGRANTS BUT RATHER SOME NOMAD PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN
COMPELLED FROM STRESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES TO SEEK THEMSELVES A NEW
COUNTRY THERE ROSE THROUGH THE CLEAR AIR A CONFUSED CLATTERING AND
RUMBLING FROM THIS GREAT MASS OF HUMANITY WITH THE CREAKING OF
WHEELS AND THE NEIGHING OF HORSES LOUD AS IT WAS IT WAS NOT
SUFFICIENT TO ROUSE THE TWO TIRED WAYFARERS ABOVE THEM
AT THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN THERE RODE A SCORE OR MORE OF GRAVE
IRONFACED MEN CLAD IN SOMBRE HOMESPUN GARMENTS AND ARMED WITH
RIFLES ON REACHING THE BASE OF THE BLUFF THEY HALTED AND HELD A
SHORT COUNCIL AMONG THEMSELVES
THE WELLS ARE TO THE RIGHT MY BROTHERS SAID ONE A HARDLIPPED
CLEANSHAVEN MAN WITH GRIZZLY HAIR
TO THE RIGHT OF THE SIERRA BLANCOSO WE SHALL REACH THE RIO
GRANDE SAID ANOTHER
FEAR NOT FOR WATER CRIED A THIRD HE WHO COULD DRAW IT FROM THE
ROCKS WILL NOT NOW ABANDON HIS OWN CHOSEN PEOPLE
AMEN AMEN RESPONDED THE WHOLE PARTY
THEY WERE ABOUT TO RESUME THEIR JOURNEY WHEN ONE OF THE YOUNGEST AND
KEENESTEYED UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION AND POINTED UP AT THE RUGGED CRAG
ABOVE THEM FROM ITS SUMMIT THERE FLUTTERED A LITTLE WISP OF PINK
SHOWING UP HARD AND BRIGHT AGAINST THE GREY ROCKS BEHIND AT THE
SIGHT THERE WAS A GENERAL REINING UP OF HORSES AND UNSLINGING OF
GUNS WHILE FRESH HORSEMEN CAME GALLOPING UP TO REINFORCE THE
VANGUARD THE WORD REDSKINS WAS ON EVERY LIP
THERE CANT BE ANY NUMBER OF INJUNS HERE SAID THE ELDERLY MAN WHO
APPEARED TO BE IN COMMAND WE HAVE PASSED THE PAWNEES AND THERE ARE
NO OTHER TRIBES UNTIL WE CROSS THE GREAT MOUNTAINS
SHALL I GO FORWARD AND SEE BROTHER STANGERSON ASKED ONE OF THE
BAND
AND I AND I CRIED A DOZEN VOICES
LEAVE YOUR HORSES BELOW AND WE WILL AWAIT YOU HERE THE ELDER
ANSWERED IN A MOMENT THE YOUNG FELLOWS HAD DISMOUNTED FASTENED
THEIR HORSES AND WERE ASCENDING THE PRECIPITOUS SLOPE WHICH LED UP
TO THE OBJECT WHICH HAD EXCITED THEIR CURIOSITY THEY ADVANCED
RAPIDLY AND NOISELESSLY WITH THE CONFIDENCE AND DEXTERITY OF
PRACTISED SCOUTS THE WATCHERS FROM THE PLAIN BELOW COULD SEE THEM
FLIT FROM ROCK TO ROCK UNTIL THEIR FIGURES STOOD OUT AGAINST THE
SKYLINE THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD FIRST GIVEN THE ALARM WAS LEADING
THEM SUDDENLY HIS FOLLOWERS SAW HIM THROW UP HIS HANDS AS THOUGH
OVERCOME WITH ASTONISHMENT AND ON JOINING HIM THEY WERE AFFECTED IN
THE SAME WAY BY THE SIGHT WHICH MET THEIR EYES
ON THE LITTLE PLATEAU WHICH CROWNED THE BARREN HILL THERE STOOD A
SINGLE GIANT BOULDER AND AGAINST THIS BOULDER THERE LAY A TALL MAN
LONGBEARDED AND HARDFEATURED BUT OF AN EXCESSIVE THINNESS HIS
PLACID FACE AND REGULAR BREATHING SHOWED THAT HE WAS FAST ASLEEP
BESIDE HIM LAY A LITTLE CHILD WITH HER ROUND WHITE ARMS ENCIRCLING
HIS BROWN SINEWY NECK AND HER GOLDEN HAIRED HEAD RESTING UPON THE
BREAST OF HIS VELVETEEN TUNIC HER ROSY LIPS WERE PARTED SHOWING THE
REGULAR LINE OF SNOWWHITE TEETH WITHIN AND A PLAYFUL SMILE PLAYED
OVER HER INFANTILE FEATURES HER PLUMP LITTLE WHITE LEGS TERMINATING
IN WHITE SOCKS AND NEAT SHOES WITH SHINING BUCKLES OFFERED A STRANGE
CONTRAST TO THE LONG SHRIVELLED MEMBERS OF HER COMPANION ON THE
LEDGE OF ROCK ABOVE THIS STRANGE COUPLE THERE STOOD THREE SOLEMN
BUZZARDS WHO AT THE SIGHT OF THE NEW COMERS UTTERED RAUCOUS SCREAMS
OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND FLAPPED SULLENLY AWAY
THE CRIES OF THE FOUL BIRDS AWOKE THE TWO SLEEPERS WHO STARED ABOUT
THEM IN BEWILDERMENT THE MAN STAGGERED TO HIS FEET AND LOOKED DOWN
UPON THE PLAIN WHICH HAD BEEN SO DESOLATE WHEN SLEEP HAD OVERTAKEN
HIM AND WHICH WAS NOW TRAVERSED BY THIS ENORMOUS BODY OF MEN AND OF
BEASTS HIS FACE ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF INCREDULITY AS HE GAZED
AND HE PASSED HIS BONEY HAND OVER HIS EYES THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL
DELIRIUM I GUESS HE MUTTERED THE CHILD STOOD BESIDE HIM HOLDING
ON TO THE SKIRT OF HIS COAT AND SAID NOTHING BUT LOOKED ALL ROUND
HER WITH THE WONDERING QUESTIONING GAZE OF CHILDHOOD
THE RESCUING PARTY WERE SPEEDILY ABLE TO CONVINCE THE TWO CASTAWAYS
THAT THEIR APPEARANCE WAS NO DELUSION ONE OF THEM SEIZED THE LITTLE
GIRL AND HOISTED HER UPON HIS SHOULDER WHILE TWO OTHERS SUPPORTED
HER GAUNT COMPANION AND ASSISTED HIM TOWARDS THE WAGGONS
MY NAME IS JOHN FERRIER THE WANDERER EXPLAINED ME AND THAT
LITTLE UN ARE ALL THATS LEFT O TWENTYONE PEOPLE THE REST IS ALL
DEAD O THIRST AND HUNGER AWAY DOWN IN THE SOUTH

THIS DAY ON WHO ARE YOU THOUGH HE CONTINUED GLANCING WITH
CURIOSITY AT HIS STALWART SUNBURNED RESCUERS THERE SEEMS TO BE A
POWERFUL LOT OF YE

PERSECUTED CHILDREN OF GODTHE CHOSEN OF THE ANGEL MERONA
I NEVER HEARD TELL ON HIM SAID THE WANDERER HE APPEARS TO HAVE
CHOSEN A FAIR CROWD OF YE

JOSEPH SMITH AT PALMYRA WE HAVE COME FROM NAUVOO IN THE STATE OF
ILLINOIS WHERE WE HAD FOUNDED OUR TEMPLE WE HAVE COME TO SEEK A
REFUGE FROM THE VIOLENT MAN AND FROM THE GODLESS EVEN THOUGH IT BE
THE HEART OF THE DESERT
THE NAME OF NAUVOO EVIDENTLY RECALLED RECOLLECTIONS TO JOHN FERRIER
I SEE HE SAID YOU ARE THE MORMONS
WE ARE THE MORMONS ANSWERED HIS COMPANIONS WITH ONE VOICE
AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING
WE DO NOT KNOW THE HAND OF GOD IS LEADING US UNDER THE PERSON OF
OUR PROPHET YOU MUST COME BEFORE HIM HE SHALL SAY WHAT IS TO BE
DONE WITH YOU
THEY HAD REACHED THE BASE OF THE HILL BY THIS TIME AND WERE
SURROUNDED BY CROWDS OF THE PILGRIMSPALEFACED MEEKLOOKING WOMEN
STRONG LAUGHING CHILDREN AND ANXIOUS EARNESTEYED MEN MANY WERE THE
CRIES OF ASTONISHMENT AND OF COMMISERATION WHICH AROSE FROM THEM WHEN
THEY PERCEIVED THE YOUTH OF ONE OF THE STRANGERS AND THE DESTITUTION
OF THE OTHER THEIR ESCORT DID NOT HALT HOWEVER BUT PUSHED ON
FOLLOWED BY A GREAT CROWD OF MORMONS UNTIL THEY REACHED A WAGGON
WHICH WAS CONSPICUOUS FOR ITS GREAT SIZE AND FOR THE GAUDINESS AND
SMARTNESS OF ITS APPEARANCE SIX HORSES WERE YOKED TO IT WHEREAS THE
OTHERS WERE FURNISHED WITH TWO OR AT MOST FOUR APIECE BESIDE THE
DRIVER THERE SAT A MAN WHO COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS
OF AGE BUT WHOSE MASSIVE HEAD AND RESOLUTE EXPRESSION MARKED HIM AS
A LEADER HE WAS READING A BROWNBACKED VOLUME BUT AS THE CROWD
APPROACHED HE LAID IT ASIDE AND LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO AN ACCOUNT
OF THE EPISODE THEN HE TURNED TO THE TWO CASTAWAYS
IF WE TAKE YOU WITH US HE SAID IN SOLEMN WORDS IT CAN ONLY BE
AS BELIEVERS IN OUR OWN CREED WE SHALL HAVE NO WOLVES IN OUR FOLD
BETTER FAR THAT YOUR BONES SHOULD BLEACH IN THIS WILDERNESS THAN THAT
YOU SHOULD PROVE TO BE THAT LITTLE SPECK OF DECAY WHICH IN TIME

EMPHASIS THAT THE GRAVE ELDERS COULD NOT RESTRAIN A SMILE THE LEADER

AND THE CHILD LIKEWISE LET IT BE YOUR TASK ALSO TO TEACH HIM OUR
HOLY CREED WE HAVE DELAYED LONG ENOUGH FORWARD ON ON TO ZION
ON ON TO ZION CRIED THE CROWD OF MORMONS AND THE WORDS RIPPLED
DOWN THE LONG CARAVAN PASSING FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH UNTIL THEY DIED
AWAY IN A DULL MURMUR IN THE FAR DISTANCE WITH A CRACKING OF WHIPS
AND A CREAKING OF WHEELS THE GREAT WAGGONS GOT INTO MOTION AND SOON
THE WHOLE CARAVAN WAS WINDING ALONG ONCE MORE THE ELDER TO WHOSE
CARE THE TWO WAIFS HAD BEEN COMMITTED LED THEM TO HIS WAGGON WHERE
A MEAL WAS ALREADY AWAITING THEM
YOU SHALL REMAIN HERE HE SAID IN A FEW DAYS YOU WILL HAVE
RECOVERED FROM YOUR FATIGUES IN THE MEANTIME REMEMBER THAT NOW AND
FOREVER YOU ARE OF OUR RELIGION BRIGHAM YOUNG HAS SAID IT AND HE
HAS SPOKEN WITH THE VOICE OF JOSEPH SMITH WHICH IS THE VOICE OF
GOD
CHAPTER II
THE FLOWER OF UTAH
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO COMMEMORATE THE TRIALS AND PRIVATIONS
ENDURED BY THE IMMIGRANT MORMONS BEFORE THEY CAME TO THEIR FINAL
HAVEN FROM THE SHORES OF THE MISSISSIPPI TO THE WESTERN SLOPES OF
THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS THEY HAD STRUGGLED ON WITH A CONSTANCY ALMOST
UNPARALLELED IN HISTORY THE SAVAGE MAN AND THE SAVAGE BEAST
HUNGER THIRST FATIGUE AND DISEASEEVERY IMPEDIMENT WHICH NATURE
COULD PLACE IN THE WAYHAD ALL BEEN OVERCOME WITH ANGLOSAXON
TENACITY YET THE LONG JOURNEY AND THE ACCUMULATED TERRORS HAD SHAKEN
THE HEARTS OF THE STOUTEST AMONG THEM THERE WAS NOT ONE WHO DID NOT
SINK UPON HIS KNEES IN HEARTFELT PRAYER WHEN THEY SAW THE BROAD
VALLEY OF UTAH BATHED IN THE SUNLIGHT BENEATH THEM AND LEARNED FROM
THE LIPS OF THEIR LEADER THAT THIS WAS THE PROMISED LAND AND THAT
THESE VIRGIN ACRES WERE TO BE THEIRS FOR EVERMORE
YOUNG SPEEDILY PROVED HIMSELF TO BE A SKILFUL ADMINISTRATOR AS WELL
AS A RESOLUTE CHIEF MAPS WERE DRAWN AND CHARTS PREPARED IN WHICH
THE FUTURE CITY WAS SKETCHED OUT ALL AROUND FARMS WERE APPORTIONED
AND ALLOTTED IN PROPORTION TO THE STANDING OF EACH INDIVIDUAL THE
TRADESMAN WAS PUT TO HIS TRADE AND THE ARTISAN TO HIS CALLING IN THE
TOWN STREETS AND SQUARES SPRANG UP AS IF BY MAGIC IN THE COUNTRY
THERE WAS DRAINING AND HEDGING PLANTING AND CLEARING UNTIL THE NEXT
SUMMER SAW THE WHOLE COUNTRY GOLDEN WITH THE WHEAT CROP EVERYTHING
PROSPERED IN THE STRANGE SETTLEMENT ABOVE ALL THE GREAT TEMPLE
WHICH THEY HAD ERECTED IN THE CENTRE OF THE CITY GREW EVER TALLER AND
LARGER FROM THE FIRST BLUSH OF DAWN UNTIL THE CLOSING OF THE
TWILIGHT THE CLATTER OF THE HAMMER AND THE RASP OF THE SAW WAS NEVER
ABSENT FROM THE MONUMENT WHICH THE IMMIGRANTS ERECTED TO HIM WHO HAD
LED THEM SAFE THROUGH MANY DANGERS
THE TWO CASTAWAYS JOHN FERRIER AND THE LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD SHARED
HIS FORTUNES AND HAD BEEN ADOPTED AS HIS DAUGHTER ACCOMPANIED THE
MORMONS TO THE END OF THEIR GREAT PILGRIMAGE LITTLE LUCY FERRIER WAS
BORNE ALONG PLEASANTLY ENOUGH IN ELDER STANGERSONS WAGGON A RETREAT
WHICH SHE SHARED WITH THE MORMONS THREE WIVES AND WITH HIS SON A
HEADSTRONG FORWARD BOY OF TWELVE HAVING RALLIED WITH THE ELASTICITY
OF CHILDHOOD FROM THE SHOCK CAUSED BY HER MOTHERS DEATH SHE SOON
BECAME A PET WITH THE WOMEN AND RECONCILED HERSELF TO THIS NEW LIFE
IN HER MOVING CANVASCOVERED HOME IN THE MEANTIME FERRIER HAVING
RECOVERED FROM HIS PRIVATIONS DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AS A USEFUL
GUIDE AND AN INDEFATIGABLE HUNTER SO RAPIDLY DID HE GAIN THE ESTEEM
OF HIS NEW COMPANIONS THAT WHEN THEY REACHED THE END OF THEIR
WANDERINGS IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THAT HE SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH
AS LARGE AND AS FERTILE A TRACT OF LAND AS ANY OF THE SETTLERS WITH
THE EXCEPTION OF YOUNG HIMSELF AND OF STANGERSON KEMBALL JOHNSTON
AND DREBBER WHO WERE THE FOUR PRINCIPAL ELDERS
ON THE FARM THUS ACQUIRED JOHN FERRIER BUILT HIMSELF A SUBSTANTIAL
LOGHOUSE WHICH RECEIVED SO MANY ADDITIONS IN SUCCEEDING YEARS THAT
IT GREW INTO A ROOMY VILLA HE WAS A MAN OF A PRACTICAL TURN OF MIND
KEEN IN HIS DEALINGS AND SKILFUL WITH HIS HANDS HIS IRON
CONSTITUTION ENABLED HIM TO WORK MORNING AND EVENING AT IMPROVING AND
TILLING HIS LANDS HENCE IT CAME ABOUT THAT HIS FARM AND ALL THAT
BELONGED TO HIM PROSPERED EXCEEDINGLY IN THREE YEARS HE WAS BETTER
OFF THAN HIS NEIGHBOURS IN SIX HE WAS WELLTODO IN NINE HE WAS
RICH AND IN TWELVE THERE WERE NOT HALF A DOZEN MEN IN THE WHOLE OF
SALT LAKE CITY WHO COULD COMPARE WITH HIM FROM THE GREAT INLAND SEA
TO THE DISTANT WAHSATCH MOUNTAINS THERE WAS NO NAME BETTER KNOWN THAN
THAT OF JOHN FERRIER
THERE WAS ONE WAY AND ONLY ONE IN WHICH HE OFFENDED THE
SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF HIS CORELIGIONISTS NO ARGUMENT OR PERSUASION
COULD EVER INDUCE HIM TO SET UP A FEMALE ESTABLISHMENT AFTER THE
MANNER OF HIS COMPANIONS HE NEVER GAVE REASONS FOR THIS PERSISTENT
REFUSAL BUT CONTENTED HIMSELF BY RESOLUTELY AND INFLEXIBLY ADHERING
TO HIS DETERMINATION THERE WERE SOME WHO ACCUSED HIM OF LUKEWARMNESS
IN HIS ADOPTED RELIGION AND OTHERS WHO PUT IT DOWN TO GREED OF
WEALTH AND RELUCTANCE TO INCUR EXPENSE OTHERS AGAIN SPOKE OF SOME
EARLY LOVE AFFAIR AND OF A FAIRHAIRED GIRL WHO HAD PINED AWAY ON
THE SHORES OF THE ATLANTIC WHATEVER THE REASON FERRIER REMAINED
STRICTLY CELIBATE IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT HE CONFORMED TO THE
RELIGION OF THE YOUNG SETTLEMENT AND GAINED THE NAME OF BEING AN
ORTHODOX AND STRAIGHTWALKING MAN
LUCY FERRIER GREW UP WITHIN THE LOGHOUSE AND ASSISTED HER ADOPTED
FATHER IN ALL HIS UNDERTAKINGS THE KEEN AIR OF THE MOUNTAINS AND THE
BALSAMIC ODOUR OF THE PINE TREES TOOK THE PLACE OF NURSE AND MOTHER
TO THE YOUNG GIRL AS YEAR SUCCEEDED TO YEAR SHE GREW TALLER AND
STRONGER HER CHEEK MORE RUDY AND HER STEP MORE ELASTIC MANY A
WAYFARER UPON THE HIGH ROAD WHICH RAN BY FERRIERS FARM FELT
LONGFORGOTTEN THOUGHTS REVIVE IN THEIR MIND AS THEY WATCHED HER
LITHE GIRLISH FIGURE TRIPPING THROUGH THE WHEATFIELDS OR MET HER
MOUNTED UPON HER FATHERS MUSTANG AND MANAGING IT WITH ALL THE EASE
AND GRACE OF A TRUE CHILD OF THE WEST SO THE BUD BLOSSOMED INTO A
FLOWER AND THE YEAR WHICH SAW HER FATHER THE RICHEST OF THE FARMERS
LEFT HER AS FAIR A SPECIMEN OF AMERICAN GIRLHOOD AS COULD BE FOUND IN
THE WHOLE PACIFIC SLOPE
IT WAS NOT THE FATHER HOWEVER WHO FIRST DISCOVERED THAT THE CHILD
HAD DEVELOPED INTO THE WOMAN IT SELDOM IS IN SUCH CASES THAT
MYSTERIOUS CHANGE IS TOO SUBTLE AND TOO GRADUAL TO BE MEASURED BY
DATES LEAST OF ALL DOES THE MAIDEN HERSELF KNOW IT UNTIL THE TONE OF
A VOICE OR THE TOUCH OF A HAND SETS HER HEART THRILLING WITHIN HER
AND SHE LEARNS WITH A MIXTURE OF PRIDE AND OF FEAR THAT A NEW AND A
LARGER NATURE HAS AWOKEN WITHIN HER THERE ARE FEW WHO CANNOT RECALL
THAT DAY AND REMEMBER THE ONE LITTLE INCIDENT WHICH HERALDED THE DAWN
OF A NEW LIFE IN THE CASE OF LUCY FERRIER THE OCCASION WAS SERIOUS
ENOUGH IN ITSELF APART FROM ITS FUTURE INFLUENCE ON HER DESTINY AND
THAT OF MANY BESIDES
IT WAS A WARM JUNE MORNING AND THE LATTER DAY SAINTS WERE AS BUSY AS
THE BEES WHOSE HIVE THEY HAVE CHOSEN FOR THEIR EMBLEM IN THE FIELDS
AND IN THE STREETS ROSE THE SAME HUM OF HUMAN INDUSTRY DOWN THE
DUSTY HIGH ROADS DEFILED LONG STREAMS OF HEAVILYLADEN MULES ALL
HEADING TO THE WEST FOR THE GOLD FEVER HAD BROKEN OUT IN CALIFORNIA
AND THE OVERLAND ROUTE LAY THROUGH THE CITY OF THE ELECT THERE TOO
WERE DROVES OF SHEEP AND BULLOCKS COMING IN FROM THE OUTLYING PASTURE
LANDS AND TRAINS OF TIRED IMMIGRANTS MEN AND HORSES EQUALLY WEARY
OF THEIR INTERMINABLE JOURNEY THROUGH ALL THIS MOTLEY ASSEMBLAGE
THREADING HER WAY WITH THE SKILL OF AN ACCOMPLISHED RIDER THERE
GALLOPED LUCY FERRIER HER FAIR FACE FLUSHED WITH THE EXERCISE AND
HER LONG CHESTNUT HAIR FLOATING OUT BEHIND HER SHE HAD A COMMISSION
FROM HER FATHER IN THE CITY AND WAS DASHING IN AS SHE HAD DONE MANY
A TIME BEFORE WITH ALL THE FEARLESSNESS OF YOUTH THINKING ONLY OF
HER TASK AND HOW IT WAS TO BE PERFORMED THE TRAVELSTAINED
ADVENTURERS GAZED AFTER HER IN ASTONISHMENT AND EVEN THE UNEMOTIONAL
INDIANS JOURNEYING IN WITH THEIR PELTIES RELAXED THEIR ACCUSTOMED
STOICISM AS THEY MARVELLED AT THE BEAUTY OF THE PALEFACED MAIDEN
SHE HAD REACHED THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY WHEN SHE FOUND THE ROAD
BLOCKED BY A GREAT DROVE OF CATTLE DRIVEN BY A HALFDOZEN
WILDLOOKING HERDSMEN FROM THE PLAINS IN HER IMPATIENCE SHE
ENDEAVOURED TO PASS THIS OBSTACLE BY PUSHING HER HORSE INTO WHAT
APPEARED TO BE A GAP SCARCELY HAD SHE GOT FAIRLY INTO IT HOWEVER
BEFORE THE BEASTS CLOSED IN BEHIND HER AND SHE FOUND HERSELF
COMPLETELY IMBEDDED IN THE MOVING STREAM OF FIERCEEYED LONGHORNED
BULLOCKS ACCUSTOMED AS SHE WAS TO DEAL WITH CATTLE SHE WAS NOT
ALARMED AT HER SITUATION BUT TOOK ADVANTAGE OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO
URGE HER HORSE ON IN THE HOPES OF PUSHING HER WAY THROUGH THE
CAVALCADE UNFORTUNATELY THE HORNS OF ONE OF THE CREATURES EITHER BY
ACCIDENT OR DESIGN CAME IN VIOLENT CONTACT WITH THE FLANK OF THE
MUSTANG AND EXCITED IT TO MADNESS IN AN INSTANT IT REARED UP UPON
ITS HIND LEGS WITH A SNORT OF RAGE AND PRANCED AND TOSSED IN A WAY
THAT WOULD HAVE UNSEATED ANY BUT A MOST SKILFUL RIDER THE SITUATION
WAS FULL OF PERIL EVERY PLUNGE OF THE EXCITED HORSE BROUGHT IT
AGAINST THE HORNS AGAIN AND GOADED IT TO FRESH MADNESS IT WAS ALL
THAT THE GIRL COULD DO TO KEEP HERSELF IN THE SADDLE YET A SLIP
WOULD MEAN A TERRIBLE DEATH UNDER THE HOOFS OF THE UNWIELDY AND
TERRIFIED ANIMALS UNACCUSTOMED TO SUDDEN EMERGENCIES HER HEAD BEGAN
TO SWIM AND HER GRIP UPON THE BRIDLE TO RELAX CHOKED BY THE RISING
CLOUD OF DUST AND BY THE STEAM FROM THE STRUGGLING CREATURES SHE
MIGHT HAVE ABANDONED HER EFFORTS IN DESPAIR BUT FOR A KINDLY VOICE
AT HER ELBOW WHICH ASSURED HER OF ASSISTANCE AT THE SAME MOMENT A
SINEWY BROWN HAND CAUGHT THE FRIGHTENED HORSE BY THE CURB AND
FORCING A WAY THROUGH THE DROVE SOON BROUGHT HER TO THE OUTSKIRTS
YOURE NOT HURT I HOPE MISS SAID HER PRESERVER RESPECTFULLY
SHE LOOKED UP AT HIS DARK FIERCE FACE AND LAUGHED SAUCILY IM
AWFUL FRIGHTENED SHE SAID NAIVELY WHOEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THAT PONCHO WOULD HAVE BEEN SO SCARED BY A LOT OF COWS
THANK GOD YOU KEPT YOUR SEAT THE OTHER SAID EARNESTLY HE WAS A
TALL SAVAGELOOKING YOUNG FELLOW MOUNTED ON A POWERFUL ROAN HORSE
AND CLAD IN THE ROUGH DRESS OF A HUNTER WITH A LONG RIFLE SLUNG OVER
HIS SHOULDERS I GUESS YOU ARE THE DAUGHTER OF JOHN FERRIER HE
REMARKED I SAW YOU RIDE DOWN FROM HIS HOUSE WHEN YOU SEE HIM ASK

TRUST ME WITH HIS BUSINESS ANY MORE GOODBYE
GOODBYE HE ANSWERED RAISING HIS BROAD SOMBRERO AND BENDING OVER
HER LITTLE HAND SHE WHEELED HER MUSTANG ROUND GAVE IT A CUT WITH
HER RIDINGWHIP AND DARTED AWAY DOWN THE BROAD ROAD IN A ROLLING
CLOUD OF DUST
YOUNG JEFFERSON HOPE RODE ON WITH HIS COMPANIONS GLOOMY AND
TACITURN HE AND THEY HAD BEEN AMONG THE NEVADA MOUNTAINS PROSPECTING
FOR SILVER AND WERE RETURNING TO SALT LAKE CITY IN THE HOPE OF
RAISING CAPITAL ENOUGH TO WORK SOME LODES WHICH THEY HAD DISCOVERED
HE HAD BEEN AS KEEN AS ANY OF THEM UPON THE BUSINESS UNTIL THIS
SUDDEN INCIDENT HAD DRAWN HIS THOUGHTS INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL THE
SIGHT OF THE FAIR YOUNG GIRL AS FRANK AND WHOLESOME AS THE SIERRA
BREEZES HAD STIRRED HIS VOLCANIC UNTAMED HEART TO ITS VERY DEPTHS
WHEN SHE HAD VANISHED FROM HIS SIGHT HE REALIZED THAT A CRISIS HAD
COME IN HIS LIFE AND THAT NEITHER SILVER SPECULATIONS NOR ANY OTHER
QUESTIONS COULD EVER BE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE TO HIM AS THIS NEW AND
ALLABSORBING ONE THE LOVE WHICH HAD SPRUNG UP IN HIS HEART WAS NOT
THE SUDDEN CHANGEABLE FANCY OF A BOY BUT RATHER THE WILD FIERCE
PASSION OF A MAN OF STRONG WILL AND IMPERIOUS TEMPER HE HAD BEEN
ACCUSTOMED TO SUCCEED IN ALL THAT HE UNDERTOOK HE SWORE IN HIS HEART
THAT HE WOULD NOT FAIL IN THIS IF HUMAN EFFORT AND HUMAN PERSEVERANCE
COULD RENDER HIM SUCCESSFUL
HE CALLED ON JOHN FERRIER THAT NIGHT AND MANY TIMES AGAIN UNTIL HIS
FACE WAS A FAMILIAR ONE AT THE FARMHOUSE JOHN COOPED UP IN THE
VALLEY AND ABSORBED IN HIS WORK HAD HAD LITTLE CHANCE OF LEARNING
THE NEWS OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD DURING THE LAST TWELVE YEARS ALL THIS
JEFFERSON HOPE WAS ABLE TO TELL HIM AND IN A STYLE WHICH INTERESTED
LUCY AS WELL AS HER FATHER HE HAD BEEN A PIONEER IN CALIFORNIA AND
COULD NARRATE MANY A STRANGE TALE OF FORTUNES MADE AND FORTUNES LOST
IN THOSE WILD HALCYON DAYS HE HAD BEEN A SCOUT TOO AND A TRAPPER
A SILVER EXPLORER AND A RANCHMAN WHEREVER STIRRING ADVENTURES WERE
TO BE HAD JEFFERSON HOPE HAD BEEN THERE IN SEARCH OF THEM HE SOON
BECAME A FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD FARMER WHO SPOKE ELOQUENTLY OF HIS
VIRTUES ON SUCH OCCASIONS LUCY WAS SILENT BUT HER BLUSHING CHEEK
AND HER BRIGHT HAPPY EYES SHOWED ONLY TOO CLEARLY THAT HER YOUNG
HEART WAS NO LONGER HER OWN HER HONEST FATHER MAY NOT HAVE OBSERVED
THESE SYMPTOMS BUT THEY WERE ASSUREDLY NOT THROWN AWAY UPON THE MAN
WHO HAD WON HER AFFECTIONS
IT WAS A SUMMER EVENING WHEN HE CAME GALLOPING DOWN THE ROAD AND
PULLED UP AT THE GATE SHE WAS AT THE DOORWAY AND CAME DOWN TO MEET
HIM HE THREW THE BRIDLE OVER THE FENCE AND STRODE UP THE PATHWAY
I AM OFF LUCY HE SAID TAKING HER TWO HANDS IN HIS AND GAZING
TENDERLY DOWN INTO HER FACE I WONT ASK YOU TO COME WITH ME NOW
BUT WILL YOU BE READY TO COME WHEN I AM HERE AGAIN
AND WHEN WILL THAT BE SHE ASKED BLUSHING AND LAUGHING
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AT THE OUTSIDE I WILL COME AND CLAIM YOU THEN
MY DARLING THERES NO ONE WHO CAN STAND BETWEEN US
AND HOW ABOUT FATHER SHE ASKED
HE HAS GIVEN HIS CONSENT PROVIDED WE GET THESE MINES WORKING ALL
RIGHT I HAVE NO FEAR ON THAT HEAD
OH WELL OF COURSE IF YOU AND FATHER HAVE ARRANGED IT ALL THERES

BREAST
THANK GOD HE SAID HOARSELY STOOPING AND KISSING HER IT IS
SETTLED THEN THE LONGER I STAY THE HARDER IT WILL BE TO GO THEY
ARE WAITING FOR ME AT THE CAON GOODBYE MY OWN DARLINGGOODBYE
IN TWO MONTHS YOU SHALL SEE ME
HE TORE HIMSELF FROM HER AS HE SPOKE AND FLINGING HIMSELF UPON HIS
HORSE GALLOPED FURIOUSLY AWAY NEVER EVEN LOOKING ROUND AS THOUGH
AFRAID THAT HIS RESOLUTION MIGHT FAIL HIM IF HE TOOK ONE GLANCE AT
WHAT HE WAS LEAVING SHE STOOD AT THE GATE GAZING AFTER HIM UNTIL HE
VANISHED FROM HER SIGHT THEN SHE WALKED BACK INTO THE HOUSE THE
HAPPIEST GIRL IN ALL UTAH
CHAPTER III
JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET
THREE WEEKS HAD PASSED SINCE JEFFERSON HOPE AND HIS COMRADES HAD
DEPARTED FROM SALT LAKE CITY JOHN FERRIERS HEART WAS SORE WITHIN
HIM WHEN HE THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG MANS RETURN AND OF THE IMPENDING
LOSS OF HIS ADOPTED CHILD YET HER BRIGHT AND HAPPY FACE RECONCILED
HIM TO THE ARRANGEMENT MORE THAN ANY ARGUMENT COULD HAVE DONE HE HAD
ALWAYS DETERMINED DEEP DOWN IN HIS RESOLUTE HEART THAT NOTHING
WOULD EVER INDUCE HIM TO ALLOW HIS DAUGHTER TO WED A MORMON SUCH A
MARRIAGE HE REGARDED AS NO MARRIAGE AT ALL BUT AS A SHAME AND A
DISGRACE WHATEVER HE MIGHT THINK OF THE MORMON DOCTRINES UPON THAT
ONE POINT HE WAS INFLEXIBLE HE HAD TO SEAL HIS MOUTH ON THE SUBJECT
HOWEVER FOR TO EXPRESS AN UNORTHODOX OPINION WAS A DANGEROUS MATTER
IN THOSE DAYS IN THE LAND OF THE SAINTS
YES A DANGEROUS MATTERSO DANGEROUS THAT EVEN THE MOST SAINTLY
DARED ONLY WHISPER THEIR RELIGIOUS OPINIONS WITH BATED BREATH LEST
SOMETHING WHICH FELL FROM THEIR LIPS MIGHT BE MISCONSTRUED AND BRING
DOWN A SWIFT RETRIBUTION UPON THEM THE VICTIMS OF PERSECUTION HAD
NOW TURNED PERSECUTORS ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT AND PERSECUTORS OF THE
MOST TERRIBLE DESCRIPTION NOT THE INQUISITION OF SEVILLE NOR THE
GERMAN VEHMGERICHT NOR THE SECRET SOCIETIES OF ITALY WERE EVER ABLE
TO PUT A MORE FORMIDABLE MACHINERY IN MOTION THAN THAT WHICH CAST A
CLOUD OVER THE STATE OF UTAH
ITS INVISIBILITY AND THE MYSTERY WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO IT MADE THIS
ORGANIZATION DOUBLY TERRIBLE IT APPEARED TO BE OMNISCIENT AND
OMNIPOTENT AND YET WAS NEITHER SEEN NOR HEARD THE MAN WHO HELD OUT
AGAINST THE CHURCH VANISHED AWAY AND NONE KNEW WHITHER HE HAD GONE
OR WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN AWAITED HIM AT
HOME BUT NO FATHER EVER RETURNED TO TELL THEM HOW HE HAD FARED AT
THE HANDS OF HIS SECRET JUDGES A RASH WORD OR A HASTY ACT WAS
FOLLOWED BY ANNIHILATION AND YET NONE KNEW WHAT THE NATURE MIGHT BE
OF THIS TERRIBLE POWER WHICH WAS SUSPENDED OVER THEM NO WONDER THAT
MEN WENT ABOUT IN FEAR AND TREMBLING AND THAT EVEN IN THE HEART OF
THE WILDERNESS THEY DARED NOT WHISPER THE DOUBTS WHICH OPPRESSED
THEM
AT FIRST THIS VAGUE AND TERRIBLE POWER WAS EXERCISED ONLY UPON THE
RECALCITRANTS WHO HAVING EMBRACED THE MORMON FAITH WISHED
AFTERWARDS TO PERVERT OR TO ABANDON IT SOON HOWEVER IT TOOK A
WIDER RANGE THE SUPPLY OF ADULT WOMEN WAS RUNNING SHORT AND
POLYGAMY WITHOUT A FEMALE POPULATION ON WHICH TO DRAW WAS A BARREN
DOCTRINE INDEED STRANGE RUMOURS BEGAN TO BE BANDIED ABOUTRUMOURS
OF MURDERED IMMIGRANTS AND RIFLED CAMPS IN REGIONS WHERE INDIANS HAD
NEVER BEEN SEEN FRESH WOMEN APPEARED IN THE HAREMS OF THE
ELDERSWOMEN WHO PINED AND WEPT AND BORE UPON THEIR FACES THE
TRACES OF AN UNEXTINGUISHABLE HORROR BELATED WANDERERS UPON THE
MOUNTAINS SPOKE OF GANGS OF ARMED MEN MASKED STEALTHY AND
NOISELESS WHO FLITTED BY THEM IN THE DARKNESS THESE TALES AND
RUMOURS TOOK SUBSTANCE AND SHAPE AND WERE CORROBORATED AND
RECORROBORATED UNTIL THEY RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO A DEFINITE NAME
TO THIS DAY IN THE LONELY RANCHES OF THE WEST THE NAME OF THE
DANITE BAND OR THE AVENGING ANGELS IS A SINISTER AND AN ILLOMENED
ONE
FULLER KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORGANIZATION WHICH PRODUCED SUCH TERRIBLE
RESULTS SERVED TO INCREASE RATHER THAN TO LESSEN THE HORROR WHICH IT
INSPIRED IN THE MINDS OF MEN NONE KNEW WHO BELONGED TO THIS RUTHLESS
SOCIETY THE NAMES OF THE PARTICIPATORS IN THE DEEDS OF BLOOD AND
VIOLENCE DONE UNDER THE NAME OF RELIGION WERE KEPT PROFOUNDLY SECRET
THE VERY FRIEND TO WHOM YOU COMMUNICATED YOUR MISGIVINGS AS TO THE
PROPHET AND HIS MISSION MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE WHO WOULD COME FORTH
AT NIGHT WITH FIRE AND SWORD TO EXACT A TERRIBLE REPARATION HENCE
EVERY MAN FEARED HIS NEIGHBOUR AND NONE SPOKE OF THE THINGS WHICH
WERE NEAREST HIS HEART
ONE FINE MORNING JOHN FERRIER WAS ABOUT TO SET OUT TO HIS
WHEATFIELDS WHEN HE HEARD THE CLICK OF THE LATCH AND LOOKING
THROUGH THE WINDOW SAW A STOUT SANDYHAIRED MIDDLEAGED MAN COMING
UP THE PATHWAY HIS HEART LEAPT TO HIS MOUTH FOR THIS WAS NONE OTHER
THAN THE GREAT BRIGHAM YOUNG HIMSELF FULL OF TREPIDATIONFOR HE
KNEW THAT SUCH A VISIT BODED HIM LITTLE GOODFERRIER RAN TO THE DOOR
TO GREET THE MORMON CHIEF THE LATTER HOWEVER RECEIVED HIS
SALUTATIONS COLDLY AND FOLLOWED HIM WITH A STERN FACE INTO THE
SITTINGROOM
BROTHER FERRIER HE SAID TAKING A SEAT AND EYEING THE FARMER
KEENLY FROM UNDER HIS LIGHTCOLOURED EYELASHES THE TRUE BELIEVERS
HAVE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS TO YOU WE PICKED YOU UP WHEN YOU WERE
STARVING IN THE DESERT WE SHARED OUR FOOD WITH YOU LED YOU SAFE TO
THE CHOSEN VALLEY GAVE YOU A GOODLY SHARE OF LAND AND ALLOWED YOU
TO WAX RICH UNDER OUR PROTECTION IS NOT THIS SO
IT IS SO ANSWERED JOHN FERRIER
IN RETURN FOR ALL THIS WE ASKED BUT ONE CONDITION THAT WAS THAT
YOU SHOULD EMBRACE THE TRUE FAITH AND CONFORM IN EVERY WAY TO ITS
USAGES THIS YOU PROMISED TO DO AND THIS IF COMMON REPORT SAYS
TRULY YOU HAVE NEGLECTED
AND HOW HAVE I NEGLECTED IT ASKED FERRIER THROWING OUT HIS HANDS
IN EXPOSTULATION HAVE I NOT GIVEN TO THE COMMON FUND HAVE I NOT
ATTENDED AT THE TEMPLE HAVE I NOT
WHERE ARE YOUR WIVES ASKED YOUNG LOOKING ROUND HIM CALL THEM
IN THAT I MAY GREET THEM
IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE NOT MARRIED FERRIER ANSWERED BUT WOMEN
WERE FEW AND THERE WERE MANY WHO HAD BETTER CLAIMS THAN I I WAS NOT
A LONELY MAN I HAD MY DAUGHTER TO ATTEND TO MY WANTS
IT IS OF THAT DAUGHTER THAT I WOULD SPEAK TO YOU SAID THE LEADER
OF THE MORMONS SHE HAS GROWN TO BE THE FLOWER OF UTAH AND HAS
FOUND FAVOUR IN THE EYES OF MANY WHO ARE HIGH IN THE LAND
JOHN FERRIER GROANED INTERNALLY
THERE ARE STORIES OF HER WHICH I WOULD FAIN DISBELIEVESTORIES THAT
SHE IS SEALED TO SOME GENTILE THIS MUST BE THE GOSSIP OF IDLE
TONGUES WHAT IS THE THIRTEENTH RULE IN THE CODE OF THE SAINTED
JOSEPH SMITH LET EVERY MAIDEN OF THE TRUE FAITH MARRY ONE OF THE
ELECT FOR IF SHE WED A GENTILE SHE COMMITS A GRIEVOUS SIN THIS
BEING SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU WHO PROFESS THE HOLY CREED
SHOULD SUFFER YOUR DAUGHTER TO VIOLATE IT
JOHN FERRIER MADE NO ANSWER BUT HE PLAYED NERVOUSLY WITH HIS
RIDINGWHIP
UPON THIS ONE POINT YOUR WHOLE FAITH SHALL BE TESTEDSO IT HAS BEEN
DECIDED IN THE SACRED COUNCIL OF FOUR THE GIRL IS YOUNG AND WE
WOULD NOT HAVE HER WED GREY HAIRS NEITHER WOULD WE DEPRIVE HER OF
ALL CHOICE WE ELDERS HAVE MANY HEIFERS BUT OUR CHILDREN MUST ALSO
BE PROVIDED STANGERSON HAS A SON AND DREBBER HAS A SON AND EITHER
OF THEM WOULD GLADLY WELCOME YOUR DAUGHTER TO THEIR HOUSE LET HER
CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM THEY ARE YOUNG AND RICH AND OF THE TRUE FAITH
WHAT SAY YOU TO THAT
FERRIER REMAINED SILENT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME WITH HIS BROWS KNITTED
YOU WILL GIVE US TIME HE SAID AT LAST MY DAUGHTER IS VERY
YOUNGSHE IS SCARCE OF AN AGE TO MARRY
SHE SHALL HAVE A MONTH TO CHOOSE SAID YOUNG RISING FROM HIS SEAT
AT THE END OF THAT TIME SHE SHALL GIVE HER ANSWER
HE WAS PASSING THROUGH THE DOOR WHEN HE TURNED WITH FLUSHED FACE
AND FLASHING EYES IT WERE BETTER FOR YOU JOHN FERRIER HE
THUNDERED THAT YOU AND SHE WERE NOW LYING BLANCHED SKELETONS UPON
THE SIERRA BLANCO THAN THAT YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR WEAK WILLS AGAINST
THE ORDERS OF THE HOLY FOUR
WITH A THREATENING GESTURE OF HIS HAND HE TURNED FROM THE DOOR AND
FERRIER HEARD HIS HEAVY STEP SCRUNCHING ALONG THE SHINGLY PATH
HE WAS STILL SITTING WITH HIS ELBOWS UPON HIS KNEES CONSIDERING HOW
HE SHOULD BROACH THE MATTER TO HIS DAUGHTER WHEN A SOFT HAND WAS LAID
UPON HIS AND LOOKING UP HE SAW HER STANDING BESIDE HIM ONE GLANCE
AT HER PALE FRIGHTENED FACE SHOWED HIM THAT SHE HAD HEARD WHAT HAD
PASSED
I COULD NOT HELP IT SHE SAID IN ANSWER TO HIS LOOK HIS VOICE
RANG THROUGH THE HOUSE OH FATHER FATHER WHAT SHALL WE DO
DONT YOU SCARE YOURSELF HE ANSWERED DRAWING HER TO HIM AND
PASSING HIS BROAD ROUGH HAND CARESSINGLY OVER HER CHESTNUT HAIR
WELL FIX IT UP SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER YOU DONT FIND YOUR FANCY KIND
O LESSENING FOR THIS CHAP DO YOU
A SOB AND A SQUEEZE OF HIS HAND WAS HER ONLY ANSWER
NO OF COURSE NOT I SHOULDNT CARE TO HEAR YOU SAY YOU DID HES A
LIKELY LAD AND HES A CHRISTIAN WHICH IS MORE THAN THESE FOLK HERE
IN SPITE O ALL THEIR PRAYING AND PREACHING THERES A PARTY STARTING
FOR NEVADA TOMORROW AND ILL MANAGE TO SEND HIM A MESSAGE LETTING

HELL BE BACK HERE WITH A SPEED THAT WOULD WHIP ELECTROTELEGRAPHS
LUCY LAUGHED THROUGH HER TEARS AT HER FATHERS DESCRIPTION
WHEN HE COMES HE WILL ADVISE US FOR THE BEST BUT IT IS FOR YOU
THAT I AM FRIGHTENED DEAR ONE HEARSONE HEARS SUCH DREADFUL
STORIES ABOUT THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE PROPHET SOMETHING TERRIBLE ALWAYS
HAPPENS TO THEM
BUT WE HAVENT OPPOSED HIM YET HER FATHER ANSWERED IT WILL BE
TIME TO LOOK OUT FOR SQUALLS WHEN WE DO WE HAVE A CLEAR MONTH BEFORE
US AT THE END OF THAT I GUESS WE HAD BEST SHIN OUT OF UTAH

THATS ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT
BUT THE FARM
WE WILL RAISE AS MUCH AS WE CAN IN MONEY AND LET THE REST GO TO
TELL THE TRUTH LUCY IT ISNT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE THOUGHT OF DOING

TO THEIR DARNED PROPHET IM A FREEBORN AMERICAN AND ITS ALL NEW
TO ME GUESS IM TOO OLD TO LEARN IF HE COMES BROWSING ABOUT THIS
FARM HE MIGHT CHANCE TO RUN UP AGAINST A CHARGE OF BUCKSHOT
TRAVELLING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
BUT THEY WONT LET US LEAVE HIS DAUGHTER OBJECTED

MEANTIME DONT YOU FRET YOURSELF MY DEARIE AND DONT GET YOUR EYES
SWELLED UP ELSE HELL BE WALKING INTO ME WHEN HE SEES YOU THERES
NOTHING TO BE AFEARED ABOUT AND THERES NO DANGER AT ALL
JOHN FERRIER UTTERED THESE CONSOLING REMARKS IN A VERY CONFIDENT
TONE BUT SHE COULD NOT HELP OBSERVING THAT HE PAID UNUSUAL CARE TO
THE FASTENING OF THE DOORS THAT NIGHT AND THAT HE CAREFULLY CLEANED
AND LOADED THE RUSTY OLD SHOTGUN WHICH HUNG UPON THE WALL OF HIS
BEDROOM
HEBER C KEMBALL IN ONE OF HIS SERMONS ALLUDES TO HIS HUNDRED
WIVES UNDER THIS ENDEARING EPITHET
CHAPTER IV
A FLIGHT FOR LIFE
ON THE MORNING WHICH FOLLOWED HIS INTERVIEW WITH THE MORMON PROPHET
JOHN FERRIER WENT IN TO SALT LAKE CITY AND HAVING FOUND HIS
ACQUAINTANCE WHO WAS BOUND FOR THE NEVADA MOUNTAINS HE ENTRUSTED
HIM WITH HIS MESSAGE TO JEFFERSON HOPE IN IT HE TOLD THE YOUNG MAN
OF THE IMMINENT DANGER WHICH THREATENED THEM AND HOW NECESSARY IT
WAS THAT HE SHOULD RETURN HAVING DONE THUS HE FELT EASIER IN HIS
MIND AND RETURNED HOME WITH A LIGHTER HEART
AS HE APPROACHED HIS FARM HE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE A HORSE HITCHED TO
EACH OF THE POSTS OF THE GATE STILL MORE SURPRISED WAS HE ON
ENTERING TO FIND TWO YOUNG MEN IN POSSESSION OF HIS SITTINGROOM
ONE WITH A LONG PALE FACE WAS LEANING BACK IN THE ROCKINGCHAIR
WITH HIS FEET COCKED UP UPON THE STOVE THE OTHER A BULLNECKED
YOUTH WITH COARSE BLOATED FEATURES WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE
WINDOW WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKET WHISTLING A POPULAR HYMN BOTH
OF THEM NODDED TO FERRIER AS HE ENTERED AND THE ONE IN THE
ROCKINGCHAIR COMMENCED THE CONVERSATION
MAYBE YOU DONT KNOW US HE SAID THIS HERE IS THE SON OF ELDER
DREBBER AND IM JOSEPH STANGERSON WHO TRAVELLED WITH YOU IN THE
DESERT WHEN THE LORD STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND GATHERED YOU INTO THE
TRUE FOLD
AS HE WILL ALL THE NATIONS IN HIS OWN GOOD TIME SAID THE OTHER IN
A NASAL VOICE HE GRINDETH SLOWLY BUT EXCEEDING SMALL
JOHN FERRIER BOWED COLDLY HE HAD GUESSED WHO HIS VISITORS WERE
WE HAVE COME CONTINUED STANGERSON AT THE ADVICE OF OUR FATHERS
TO SOLICIT THE HAND OF YOUR DAUGHTER FOR WHICHEVER OF US MAY SEEM
GOOD TO YOU AND TO HER AS I HAVE BUT FOUR WIVES AND BROTHER DREBBER
HERE HAS SEVEN IT APPEARS TO ME THAT MY CLAIM IS THE STRONGER ONE
NAY NAY BROTHER STANGERSON CRIED THE OTHER THE QUESTION IS NOT
HOW MANY WIVES WE HAVE BUT HOW MANY WE CAN KEEP MY FATHER HAS NOW
GIVEN OVER HIS MILLS TO ME AND I AM THE RICHER MAN
BUT MY PROSPECTS ARE BETTER SAID THE OTHER WARMLY WHEN THE LORD
REMOVES MY FATHER I SHALL HAVE HIS TANNING YARD AND HIS LEATHER
FACTORY THEN I AM YOUR ELDER AND AM HIGHER IN THE CHURCH
IT WILL BE FOR THE MAIDEN TO DECIDE REJOINED YOUNG DREBBER
SMIRKING AT HIS OWN REFLECTION IN THE GLASS WE WILL LEAVE IT ALL TO
HER DECISION
DURING THIS DIALOGUE JOHN FERRIER HAD STOOD FUMING IN THE DOORWAY
HARDLY ABLE TO KEEP HIS RIDINGWHIP FROM THE BACKS OF HIS TWO
VISITORS
LOOK HERE HE SAID AT LAST STRIDING UP TO THEM WHEN MY DAUGHTER
SUMMONS YOU YOU CAN COME BUT UNTIL THEN I DONT WANT TO SEE YOUR
FACES AGAIN
THE TWO YOUNG MORMONS STARED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT IN THEIR EYES THIS
COMPETITION BETWEEN THEM FOR THE MAIDENS HAND WAS THE HIGHEST OF
HONOURS BOTH TO HER AND HER FATHER
THERE ARE TWO WAYS OUT OF THE ROOM CRIED FERRIER THERE IS THE
DOOR AND THERE IS THE WINDOW WHICH DO YOU CARE TO USE
HIS BROWN FACE LOOKED SO SAVAGE AND HIS GAUNT HANDS SO THREATENING
THAT HIS VISITORS SPRANG TO THEIR FEET AND BEAT A HURRIED RETREAT
THE OLD FARMER FOLLOWED THEM TO THE DOOR
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE SETTLED WHICH IT IS TO BE HE SAID
SARDONICALLY
YOU SHALL SMART FOR THIS STANGERSON CRIED WHITE WITH RAGE YOU
HAVE DEFIED THE PROPHET AND THE COUNCIL OF FOUR YOU SHALL RUE IT TO
THE END OF YOUR DAYS
THE HAND OF THE LORD SHALL BE HEAVY UPON YOU CRIED YOUNG DREBBER
HE WILL ARISE AND SMITE YOU
THEN ILL START THE SMITING EXCLAIMED FERRIER FURIOUSLY AND WOULD
HAVE RUSHED UPSTAIRS FOR HIS GUN HAD NOT LUCY SEIZED HIM BY THE ARM
AND RESTRAINED HIM BEFORE HE COULD ESCAPE FROM HER THE CLATTER OF
HORSES HOOFS TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE BEYOND HIS REACH
THE YOUNG CANTING RASCALS HE EXCLAIMED WIPING THE PERSPIRATION
FROM HIS FOREHEAD I WOULD SOONER SEE YOU IN YOUR GRAVE MY GIRL
THAN THE WIFE OF EITHER OF THEM
AND SO SHOULD I FATHER SHE ANSWERED WITH SPIRIT BUT JEFFERSON
WILL SOON BE HERE
YES IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE HE COMES THE SOONER THE BETTER FOR
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEIR NEXT MOVE MAY BE
IT WAS INDEED HIGH TIME THAT SOMEONE CAPABLE OF GIVING ADVICE AND
HELP SHOULD COME TO THE AID OF THE STURDY OLD FARMER AND HIS ADOPTED
DAUGHTER IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE SETTLEMENT THERE HAD NEVER BEEN
SUCH A CASE OF RANK DISOBEDIENCE TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE ELDERS IF
MINOR ERRORS WERE PUNISHED SO STERNLY WHAT WOULD BE THE FATE OF THIS
ARCH REBEL FERRIER KNEW THAT HIS WEALTH AND POSITION WOULD BE OF NO
AVAIL TO HIM OTHERS AS WELL KNOWN AND AS RICH AS HIMSELF HAD BEEN
SPIRITED AWAY BEFORE NOW AND THEIR GOODS GIVEN OVER TO THE CHURCH
HE WAS A BRAVE MAN BUT HE TREMBLED AT THE VAGUE SHADOWY TERRORS
WHICH HUNG OVER HIM ANY KNOWN DANGER HE COULD FACE WITH A FIRM LIP
BUT THIS SUSPENSE WAS UNNERVING HE CONCEALED HIS FEARS FROM HIS
DAUGHTER HOWEVER AND AFFECTED TO MAKE LIGHT OF THE WHOLE MATTER
THOUGH SHE WITH THE KEEN EYE OF LOVE SAW PLAINLY THAT HE WAS ILL AT
EASE
HE EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD RECEIVE SOME MESSAGE OR REMONSTRANCE FROM
YOUNG AS TO HIS CONDUCT AND HE WAS NOT MISTAKEN THOUGH IT CAME IN
AN UNLOOKEDFOR MANNER UPON RISING NEXT MORNING HE FOUND TO HIS
SURPRISE A SMALL SQUARE OF PAPER PINNED ON TO THE COVERLET OF HIS
BED JUST OVER HIS CHEST ON IT WAS PRINTED IN BOLD STRAGGLING
LETTERS
TWENTYNINE DAYS ARE GIVEN YOU FOR AMENDMENT AND THEN
THE DASH WAS MORE FEARINSPIRING THAN ANY THREAT COULD HAVE BEEN HOW
THIS WARNING CAME INTO HIS ROOM PUZZLED JOHN FERRIER SORELY FOR HIS
SERVANTS SLEPT IN AN OUTHOUSE AND THE DOORS AND WINDOWS HAD ALL BEEN
SECURED HE CRUMPLED THE PAPER UP AND SAID NOTHING TO HIS DAUGHTER
BUT THE INCIDENT STRUCK A CHILL INTO HIS HEART THE TWENTYNINE DAYS
WERE EVIDENTLY THE BALANCE OF THE MONTH WHICH YOUNG HAD PROMISED
WHAT STRENGTH OR COURAGE COULD AVAIL AGAINST AN ENEMY ARMED WITH SUCH
MYSTERIOUS POWERS THE HAND WHICH FASTENED THAT PIN MIGHT HAVE STRUCK
HIM TO THE HEART AND HE COULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN WHO HAD SLAIN HIM
STILL MORE SHAKEN WAS HE NEXT MORNING THEY HAD SAT DOWN TO THEIR
BREAKFAST WHEN LUCY WITH A CRY OF SURPRISE POINTED UPWARDS IN THE
CENTRE OF THE CEILING WAS SCRAWLED WITH A BURNED STICK APPARENTLY
THE NUMBER TO HIS DAUGHTER IT WAS UNINTELLIGIBLE AND HE DID NOT
ENLIGHTEN HER THAT NIGHT HE SAT UP WITH HIS GUN AND KEPT WATCH AND
WARD HE SAW AND HE HEARD NOTHING AND YET IN THE MORNING A GREAT HAD
BEEN PAINTED UPON THE OUTSIDE OF HIS DOOR
THUS DAY FOLLOWED DAY AND AS SURE AS MORNING CAME HE FOUND THAT HIS
UNSEEN ENEMIES HAD KEPT THEIR REGISTER AND HAD MARKED UP IN SOME
CONSPICUOUS POSITION HOW MANY DAYS WERE STILL LEFT TO HIM OUT OF THE
MONTH OF GRACE SOMETIMES THE FATAL NUMBERS APPEARED UPON THE WALLS
SOMETIMES UPON THE FLOORS OCCASIONALLY THEY WERE ON SMALL PLACARDS
STUCK UPON THE GARDEN GATE OR THE RAILINGS WITH ALL HIS VIGILANCE
JOHN FERRIER COULD NOT DISCOVER WHENCE THESE DAILY WARNINGS
PROCEEDED A HORROR WHICH WAS ALMOST SUPERSTITIOUS CAME UPON HIM AT
THE SIGHT OF THEM HE BECAME HAGGARD AND RESTLESS AND HIS EYES HAD
THE TROUBLED LOOK OF SOME HUNTED CREATURE HE HAD BUT ONE HOPE IN
LIFE NOW AND THAT WAS FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG HUNTER FROM
NEVADA
TWENTY HAD CHANGED TO FIFTEEN AND FIFTEEN TO TEN BUT THERE WAS NO
NEWS OF THE ABSENTEE ONE BY ONE THE NUMBERS DWINDLED DOWN AND STILL
THERE CAME NO SIGN OF HIM WHENEVER A HORSEMAN CLATTERED DOWN THE
ROAD OR A DRIVER SHOUTED AT HIS TEAM THE OLD FARMER HURRIED TO THE
GATE THINKING THAT HELP HAD ARRIVED AT LAST AT LAST WHEN HE SAW
FIVE GIVE WAY TO FOUR AND THAT AGAIN TO THREE HE LOST HEART AND
ABANDONED ALL HOPE OF ESCAPE SINGLEHANDED AND WITH HIS LIMITED
KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOUNTAINS WHICH SURROUNDED THE SETTLEMENT HE KNEW
THAT HE WAS POWERLESS THE MOREFREQUENTED ROADS WERE STRICTLY
WATCHED AND GUARDED AND NONE COULD PASS ALONG THEM WITHOUT AN ORDER
FROM THE COUNCIL TURN WHICH WAY HE WOULD THERE APPEARED TO BE NO
AVOIDING THE BLOW WHICH HUNG OVER HIM YET THE OLD MAN NEVER WAVERED
IN HIS RESOLUTION TO PART WITH LIFE ITSELF BEFORE HE CONSENTED TO
WHAT HE REGARDED AS HIS DAUGHTERS DISHONOUR
HE WAS SITTING ALONE ONE EVENING PONDERING DEEPLY OVER HIS TROUBLES
AND SEARCHING VAINLY FOR SOME WAY OUT OF THEM THAT MORNING HAD SHOWN
THE FIGURE UPON THE WALL OF HIS HOUSE AND THE NEXT DAY WOULD BE
THE LAST OF THE ALLOTTED TIME WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN THEN ALL MANNER OF
VAGUE AND TERRIBLE FANCIES FILLED HIS IMAGINATION AND HIS
DAUGHTERWHAT WAS TO BECOME OF HER AFTER HE WAS GONE WAS THERE NO
ESCAPE FROM THE INVISIBLE NETWORK WHICH WAS DRAWN ALL ROUND THEM HE
SANK HIS HEAD UPON THE TABLE AND SOBBED AT THE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN
IMPOTENCE
WHAT WAS THAT IN THE SILENCE HE HEARD A GENTLE SCRATCHING
SOUNDLOW BUT VERY DISTINCT IN THE QUIET OF THE NIGHT IT CAME FROM
THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE FERRIER CREPT INTO THE HALL AND LISTENED
INTENTLY THERE WAS A PAUSE FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN THE LOW
INSIDIOUS SOUND WAS REPEATED SOMEONE WAS EVIDENTLY TAPPING VERY
GENTLY UPON ONE OF THE PANELS OF THE DOOR WAS IT SOME MIDNIGHT
ASSASSIN WHO HAD COME TO CARRY OUT THE MURDEROUS ORDERS OF THE SECRET
TRIBUNAL OR WAS IT SOME AGENT WHO WAS MARKING UP THAT THE LAST DAY
OF GRACE HAD ARRIVED JOHN FERRIER FELT THAT INSTANT DEATH WOULD BE
BETTER THAN THE SUSPENSE WHICH SHOOK HIS NERVES AND CHILLED HIS
HEART SPRINGING FORWARD HE DREW THE BOLT AND THREW THE DOOR OPEN
OUTSIDE ALL WAS CALM AND QUIET THE NIGHT WAS FINE AND THE STARS
WERE TWINKLING BRIGHTLY OVERHEAD THE LITTLE FRONT GARDEN LAY BEFORE
THE FARMERS EYES BOUNDED BY THE FENCE AND GATE BUT NEITHER THERE
NOR ON THE ROAD WAS ANY HUMAN BEING TO BE SEEN WITH A SIGH OF
RELIEF FERRIER LOOKED TO RIGHT AND TO LEFT UNTIL HAPPENING TO
GLANCE STRAIGHT DOWN AT HIS OWN FEET HE SAW TO HIS ASTONISHMENT A MAN
LYING FLAT UPON HIS FACE UPON THE GROUND WITH ARMS AND LEGS ALL
ASPRAWL
SO UNNERVED WAS HE AT THE SIGHT THAT HE LEANED UP AGAINST THE WALL
WITH HIS HAND TO HIS THROAT TO STIFLE HIS INCLINATION TO CALL OUT
HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT THE PROSTRATE FIGURE WAS THAT OF SOME
WOUNDED OR DYING MAN BUT AS HE WATCHED IT HE SAW IT WRITHE ALONG THE
GROUND AND INTO THE HALL WITH THE RAPIDITY AND NOISELESSNESS OF A
SERPENT ONCE WITHIN THE HOUSE THE MAN SPRANG TO HIS FEET CLOSED THE
DOOR AND REVEALED TO THE ASTONISHED FARMER THE FIERCE FACE AND
RESOLUTE EXPRESSION OF JEFFERSON HOPE
GOOD GOD GASPED JOHN FERRIER HOW YOU SCARED ME WHATEVER MADE
YOU COME IN LIKE THAT
GIVE ME FOOD THE OTHER SAID HOARSELY I HAVE HAD NO TIME FOR
BITE OR SUP FOR EIGHTANDFORTY HOURS HE FLUNG HIMSELF UPON THE
COLD MEAT AND BREAD WHICH WERE STILL LYING UPON THE TABLE FROM HIS
HOSTS SUPPER AND DEVOURED IT VORACIOUSLY DOES LUCY BEAR UP WELL
HE ASKED WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HIS HUNGER
YES SHE DOES NOT KNOW THE DANGER HER FATHER ANSWERED
THAT IS WELL THE HOUSE IS WATCHED ON EVERY SIDE THAT IS WHY I
CRAWLED MY WAY UP TO IT THEY MAY BE DARNED SHARP BUT THEYRE NOT
QUITE SHARP ENOUGH TO CATCH A WASHOE HUNTER
JOHN FERRIER FELT A DIFFERENT MAN NOW THAT HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD A
DEVOTED ALLY HE SEIZED THE YOUNG MANS LEATHERY HAND AND WRUNG IT
CORDIALLY YOURE A MAN TO BE PROUD OF HE SAID THERE ARE NOT
MANY WHO WOULD COME TO SHARE OUR DANGER AND OUR TROUBLES
YOUVE HIT IT THERE PARD THE YOUNG HUNTER ANSWERED I HAVE A
RESPECT FOR YOU BUT IF YOU WERE ALONE IN THIS BUSINESS ID THINK
TWICE BEFORE I PUT MY HEAD INTO SUCH A HORNETS NEST ITS LUCY THAT
BRINGS ME HERE AND BEFORE HARM COMES ON HER I GUESS THERE WILL BE
ONE LESS O THE HOPE FAMILY IN UTAH
WHAT ARE WE TO DO
TOMORROW IS YOUR LAST DAY AND UNLESS YOU ACT TONIGHT YOU ARE
LOST I HAVE A MULE AND TWO HORSES WAITING IN THE EAGLE RAVINE HOW
MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GOLD AND FIVE IN NOTES
THAT WILL DO I HAVE AS MUCH MORE TO ADD TO IT WE MUST PUSH FOR
CARSON CITY THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS YOU HAD BEST WAKE LUCY IT IS AS
WELL THAT THE SERVANTS DO NOT SLEEP IN THE HOUSE
WHILE FERRIER WAS ABSENT PREPARING HIS DAUGHTER FOR THE APPROACHING
JOURNEY JEFFERSON HOPE PACKED ALL THE EATABLES THAT HE COULD FIND
INTO A SMALL PARCEL AND FILLED A STONEWARE JAR WITH WATER FOR HE
KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE MOUNTAIN WELLS WERE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
HE HAD HARDLY COMPLETED HIS ARRANGEMENTS BEFORE THE FARMER RETURNED
WITH HIS DAUGHTER ALL DRESSED AND READY FOR A START THE GREETING
BETWEEN THE LOVERS WAS WARM BUT BRIEF FOR MINUTES WERE PRECIOUS
AND THERE WAS MUCH TO BE DONE
WE MUST MAKE OUR START AT ONCE SAID JEFFERSON HOPE SPEAKING IN A
LOW BUT RESOLUTE VOICE LIKE ONE WHO REALIZES THE GREATNESS OF THE
PERIL BUT HAS STEELED HIS HEART TO MEET IT THE FRONT AND BACK
ENTRANCES ARE WATCHED BUT WITH CAUTION WE MAY GET AWAY THROUGH THE
SIDE WINDOW AND ACROSS THE FIELDS ONCE ON THE ROAD WE ARE ONLY TWO
MILES FROM THE RAVINE WHERE THE HORSES ARE WAITING BY DAYBREAK WE
SHOULD BE HALFWAY THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS
WHAT IF WE ARE STOPPED ASKED FERRIER
HOPE SLAPPED THE REVOLVER BUTT WHICH PROTRUDED FROM THE FRONT OF HIS
TUNIC IF THEY ARE TOO MANY FOR US WE SHALL TAKE TWO OR THREE OF
THEM WITH US HE SAID WITH A SINISTER SMILE
THE LIGHTS INSIDE THE HOUSE HAD ALL BEEN EXTINGUISHED AND FROM THE
DARKENED WINDOW FERRIER PEERED OVER THE FIELDS WHICH HAD BEEN HIS
OWN AND WHICH HE WAS NOW ABOUT TO ABANDON FOR EVER HE HAD LONG
NERVED HIMSELF TO THE SACRIFICE HOWEVER AND THE THOUGHT OF THE
HONOUR AND HAPPINESS OF HIS DAUGHTER OUTWEIGHED ANY REGRET AT HIS
RUINED FORTUNES ALL LOOKED SO PEACEFUL AND HAPPY THE RUSTLING TREES
AND THE BROAD SILENT STRETCH OF GRAINLAND THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO
REALIZE THAT THE SPIRIT OF MURDER LURKED THROUGH IT ALL YET THE
WHITE FACE AND SET EXPRESSION OF THE YOUNG HUNTER SHOWED THAT IN HIS
APPROACH TO THE HOUSE HE HAD SEEN ENOUGH TO SATISFY HIM UPON THAT
HEAD
FERRIER CARRIED THE BAG OF GOLD AND NOTES JEFFERSON HOPE HAD THE
SCANTY PROVISIONS AND WATER WHILE LUCY HAD A SMALL BUNDLE CONTAINING
A FEW OF HER MORE VALUED POSSESSIONS OPENING THE WINDOW VERY SLOWLY
AND CAREFULLY THEY WAITED UNTIL A DARK CLOUD HAD SOMEWHAT OBSCURED
THE NIGHT AND THEN ONE BY ONE PASSED THROUGH INTO THE LITTLE GARDEN
WITH BATED BREATH AND CROUCHING FIGURES THEY STUMBLED ACROSS IT AND
GAINED THE SHELTER OF THE HEDGE WHICH THEY SKIRTED UNTIL THEY CAME
TO THE GAP WHICH OPENED INTO THE CORNFIELDS THEY HAD JUST REACHED
THIS POINT WHEN THE YOUNG MAN SEIZED HIS TWO COMPANIONS AND DRAGGED
THEM DOWN INTO THE SHADOW WHERE THEY LAY SILENT AND TREMBLING
IT WAS AS WELL THAT HIS PRAIRIE TRAINING HAD GIVEN JEFFERSON HOPE THE
EARS OF A LYNX HE AND HIS FRIENDS HAD HARDLY CROUCHED DOWN BEFORE
THE MELANCHOLY HOOTING OF A MOUNTAIN OWL WAS HEARD WITHIN A FEW YARDS
OF THEM WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY ANSWERED BY ANOTHER HOOT AT A SMALL
DISTANCE AT THE SAME MOMENT A VAGUE SHADOWY FIGURE EMERGED FROM THE
GAP FOR WHICH THEY HAD BEEN MAKING AND UTTERED THE PLAINTIVE SIGNAL
CRY AGAIN ON WHICH A SECOND MAN APPEARED OUT OF THE OBSCURITY
TOMORROW AT MIDNIGHT SAID THE FIRST WHO APPEARED TO BE IN
AUTHORITY WHEN THE WHIPPOORWILL CALLS THREE TIMES
IT IS WELL RETURNED THE OTHER SHALL I TELL BROTHER DREBBER
PASS IT ON TO HIM AND FROM HIM TO THE OTHERS NINE TO SEVEN
SEVEN TO FIVE REPEATED THE OTHER AND THE TWO FIGURES FLITTED AWAY
IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THEIR CONCLUDING WORDS HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN
SOME FORM OF SIGN AND COUNTERSIGN THE INSTANT THAT THEIR FOOTSTEPS
HAD DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE JEFFERSON HOPE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND
HELPING HIS COMPANIONS THROUGH THE GAP LED THE WAY ACROSS THE FIELDS
AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED SUPPORTING AND HALFCARRYING THE GIRL WHEN
HER STRENGTH APPEARED TO FAIL HER
HURRY ON HURRY ON HE GASPED FROM TIME TO TIME WE ARE THROUGH
THE LINE OF SENTINELS EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON SPEED HURRY ON
ONCE ON THE HIGH ROAD THEY MADE RAPID PROGRESS ONLY ONCE DID THEY
MEET ANYONE AND THEN THEY MANAGED TO SLIP INTO A FIELD AND SO AVOID
RECOGNITION BEFORE REACHING THE TOWN THE HUNTER BRANCHED AWAY INTO A
RUGGED AND NARROW FOOTPATH WHICH LED TO THE MOUNTAINS TWO DARK
JAGGED PEAKS LOOMED ABOVE THEM THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND THE DEFILE
WHICH LED BETWEEN THEM WAS THE EAGLE CAON IN WHICH THE HORSES WERE
AWAITING THEM WITH UNERRING INSTINCT JEFFERSON HOPE PICKED HIS WAY
AMONG THE GREAT BOULDERS AND ALONG THE BED OF A DRIEDUP WATERCOURSE
UNTIL HE CAME TO THE RETIRED CORNER SCREENED WITH ROCKS WHERE THE
FAITHFUL ANIMALS HAD BEEN PICKETED THE GIRL WAS PLACED UPON THE
MULE AND OLD FERRIER UPON ONE OF THE HORSES WITH HIS MONEYBAG
WHILE JEFFERSON HOPE LED THE OTHER ALONG THE PRECIPITOUS AND
DANGEROUS PATH
IT WAS A BEWILDERING ROUTE FOR ANYONE WHO WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO FACE
NATURE IN HER WILDEST MOODS ON THE ONE SIDE A GREAT CRAG TOWERED UP
A THOUSAND FEET OR MORE BLACK STERN AND MENACING WITH LONG
BASALTIC COLUMNS UPON ITS RUGGED SURFACE LIKE THE RIBS OF SOME
PETRIFIED MONSTER ON THE OTHER HAND A WILD CHAOS OF BOULDERS AND
DEBRIS MADE ALL ADVANCE IMPOSSIBLE BETWEEN THE TWO RAN THE IRREGULAR
TRACK SO NARROW IN PLACES THAT THEY HAD TO TRAVEL IN INDIAN FILE
AND SO ROUGH THAT ONLY PRACTISED RIDERS COULD HAVE TRAVERSED IT AT
ALL YET IN SPITE OF ALL DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES THE HEARTS OF THE
FUGITIVES WERE LIGHT WITHIN THEM FOR EVERY STEP INCREASED THE
DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM AND THE TERRIBLE DESPOTISM FROM WHICH THEY WERE
FLYING
THEY SOON HAD A PROOF HOWEVER THAT THEY WERE STILL WITHIN THE
JURISDICTION OF THE SAINTS THEY HAD REACHED THE VERY WILDEST AND
MOST DESOLATE PORTION OF THE PASS WHEN THE GIRL GAVE A STARTLED CRY
AND POINTED UPWARDS ON A ROCK WHICH OVERLOOKED THE TRACK SHOWING
OUT DARK AND PLAIN AGAINST THE SKY THERE STOOD A SOLITARY SENTINEL
HE SAW THEM AS SOON AS THEY PERCEIVED HIM AND HIS MILITARY CHALLENGE
OF WHO GOES THERE RANG THROUGH THE SILENT RAVINE
TRAVELLERS FOR NEVADA SAID JEFFERSON HOPE WITH HIS HAND UPON THE
RIFLE WHICH HUNG BY HIS SADDLE
THEY COULD SEE THE LONELY WATCHER FINGERING HIS GUN AND PEERING DOWN
AT THEM AS IF DISSATISFIED AT THEIR REPLY
BY WHOSE PERMISSION HE ASKED
THE HOLY FOUR ANSWERED FERRIER HIS MORMON EXPERIENCES HAD TAUGHT
HIM THAT THAT WAS THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY TO WHICH HE COULD REFER
NINE FROM SEVEN CRIED THE SENTINEL
SEVEN FROM FIVE RETURNED JEFFERSON HOPE PROMPTLY REMEMBERING THE
COUNTERSIGN WHICH HE HAD HEARD IN THE GARDEN
PASS AND THE LORD GO WITH YOU SAID THE VOICE FROM ABOVE BEYOND
HIS POST THE PATH BROADENED OUT AND THE HORSES WERE ABLE TO BREAK
INTO A TROT LOOKING BACK THEY COULD SEE THE SOLITARY WATCHER
LEANING UPON HIS GUN AND KNEW THAT THEY HAD PASSED THE OUTLYING POST
OF THE CHOSEN PEOPLE AND THAT FREEDOM LAY BEFORE THEM
CHAPTER V
THE AVENGING ANGELS
ALL NIGHT THEIR COURSE LAY THROUGH INTRICATE DEFILES AND OVER
IRREGULAR AND ROCKSTREWN PATHS MORE THAN ONCE THEY LOST THEIR WAY
BUT HOPES INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOUNTAINS ENABLED THEM TO REGAIN
THE TRACK ONCE MORE WHEN MORNING BROKE A SCENE OF MARVELLOUS THOUGH
SAVAGE BEAUTY LAY BEFORE THEM IN EVERY DIRECTION THE GREAT
SNOWCAPPED PEAKS HEMMED THEM IN PEEPING OVER EACH OTHERS SHOULDERS
TO THE FAR HORIZON SO STEEP WERE THE ROCKY BANKS ON EITHER SIDE OF
THEM THAT THE LARCH AND THE PINE SEEMED TO BE SUSPENDED OVER THEIR
HEADS AND TO NEED ONLY A GUST OF WIND TO COME HURTLING DOWN UPON
THEM NOR WAS THE FEAR ENTIRELY AN ILLUSION FOR THE BARREN VALLEY
WAS THICKLY STREWN WITH TREES AND BOULDERS WHICH HAD FALLEN IN A
SIMILAR MANNER EVEN AS THEY PASSED A GREAT ROCK CAME THUNDERING
DOWN WITH A HOARSE RATTLE WHICH WOKE THE ECHOES IN THE SILENT GORGES
AND STARTLED THE WEARY HORSES INTO A GALLOP
AS THE SUN ROSE SLOWLY ABOVE THE EASTERN HORIZON THE CAPS OF THE
GREAT MOUNTAINS LIT UP ONE AFTER THE OTHER LIKE LAMPS AT A FESTIVAL
UNTIL THEY WERE ALL RUDDY AND GLOWING THE MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE
CHEERED THE HEARTS OF THE THREE FUGITIVES AND GAVE THEM FRESH ENERGY
AT A WILD TORRENT WHICH SWEPT OUT OF A RAVINE THEY CALLED A HALT AND
WATERED THEIR HORSES WHILE THEY PARTOOK OF A HASTY BREAKFAST LUCY
AND HER FATHER WOULD FAIN HAVE RESTED LONGER BUT JEFFERSON HOPE WAS
INEXORABLE THEY WILL BE UPON OUR TRACK BY THIS TIME HE SAID
EVERYTHING DEPENDS UPON OUR SPEED ONCE SAFE IN CARSON WE MAY REST
FOR THE REMAINDER OF OUR LIVES
DURING THE WHOLE OF THAT DAY THEY STRUGGLED ON THROUGH THE DEFILES
AND BY EVENING THEY CALCULATED THAT THEY WERE MORE THAN THIRTY MILES
FROM THEIR ENEMIES AT NIGHTTIME THEY CHOSE THE BASE OF A BEETLING
CRAG WHERE THE ROCKS OFFERED SOME PROTECTION FROM THE CHILL WIND
AND THERE HUDDLED TOGETHER FOR WARMTH THEY ENJOYED A FEW HOURS
SLEEP BEFORE DAYBREAK HOWEVER THEY WERE UP AND ON THEIR WAY ONCE
MORE THEY HAD SEEN NO SIGNS OF ANY PURSUERS AND JEFFERSON HOPE
BEGAN TO THINK THAT THEY WERE FAIRLY OUT OF THE REACH OF THE TERRIBLE
ORGANIZATION WHOSE ENMITY THEY HAD INCURRED HE LITTLE KNEW HOW FAR
THAT IRON GRASP COULD REACH OR HOW SOON IT WAS TO CLOSE UPON THEM
AND CRUSH THEM
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND DAY OF THEIR FLIGHT THEIR SCANTY STORE
OF PROVISIONS BEGAN TO RUN OUT THIS GAVE THE HUNTER LITTLE
UNEASINESS HOWEVER FOR THERE WAS GAME TO BE HAD AMONG THE
MOUNTAINS AND HE HAD FREQUENTLY BEFORE HAD TO DEPEND UPON HIS RIFLE
FOR THE NEEDS OF LIFE CHOOSING A SHELTERED NOOK HE PILED TOGETHER A
FEW DRIED BRANCHES AND MADE A BLAZING FIRE AT WHICH HIS COMPANIONS
MIGHT WARM THEMSELVES FOR THEY WERE NOW NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND FEET
ABOVE THE SEA LEVEL AND THE AIR WAS BITTER AND KEEN HAVING TETHERED
THE HORSES AND BADE LUCY ADIEU HE THREW HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER
AND SET OUT IN SEARCH OF WHATEVER CHANCE MIGHT THROW IN HIS WAY
LOOKING BACK HE SAW THE OLD MAN AND THE YOUNG GIRL CROUCHING OVER THE
BLAZING FIRE WHILE THE THREE ANIMALS STOOD MOTIONLESS IN THE
BACKGROUND THEN THE INTERVENING ROCKS HID THEM FROM HIS VIEW
HE WALKED FOR A COUPLE OF MILES THROUGH ONE RAVINE AFTER ANOTHER
WITHOUT SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE MARKS UPON THE BARK OF THE TREES
AND OTHER INDICATIONS HE JUDGED THAT THERE WERE NUMEROUS BEARS IN
THE VICINITY AT LAST AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS FRUITLESS SEARCH HE
WAS THINKING OF TURNING BACK IN DESPAIR WHEN CASTING HIS EYES
UPWARDS HE SAW A SIGHT WHICH SENT A THRILL OF PLEASURE THROUGH HIS
HEART ON THE EDGE OF A JUTTING PINNACLE THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED FEET
ABOVE HIM THERE STOOD A CREATURE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING A SHEEP IN
APPEARANCE BUT ARMED WITH A PAIR OF GIGANTIC HORNS THE
BIGHORNFOR SO IT IS CALLEDWAS ACTING PROBABLY AS A GUARDIAN
OVER A FLOCK WHICH WERE INVISIBLE TO THE HUNTER BUT FORTUNATELY IT
WAS HEADING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND HAD NOT PERCEIVED HIM
LYING ON HIS FACE HE RESTED HIS RIFLE UPON A ROCK AND TOOK A LONG
AND STEADY AIM BEFORE DRAWING THE TRIGGER THE ANIMAL SPRANG INTO THE
AIR TOTTERED FOR A MOMENT UPON THE EDGE OF THE PRECIPICE AND THEN
CAME CRASHING DOWN INTO THE VALLEY BENEATH
THE CREATURE WAS TOO UNWIELDY TO LIFT SO THE HUNTER CONTENTED
HIMSELF WITH CUTTING AWAY ONE HAUNCH AND PART OF THE FLANK WITH THIS
TROPHY OVER HIS SHOULDER HE HASTENED TO RETRACE HIS STEPS FOR THE
EVENING WAS ALREADY DRAWING IN HE HAD HARDLY STARTED HOWEVER
BEFORE HE REALIZED THE DIFFICULTY WHICH FACED HIM IN HIS EAGERNESS
HE HAD WANDERED FAR PAST THE RAVINES WHICH WERE KNOWN TO HIM AND IT
WAS NO EASY MATTER TO PICK OUT THE PATH WHICH HE HAD TAKEN THE
VALLEY IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF DIVIDED AND SUBDIVIDED INTO MANY
GORGES WHICH WERE SO LIKE EACH OTHER THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
DISTINGUISH ONE FROM THE OTHER HE FOLLOWED ONE FOR A MILE OR MORE
UNTIL HE CAME TO A MOUNTAIN TORRENT WHICH HE WAS SURE THAT HE HAD
NEVER SEEN BEFORE CONVINCED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THE WRONG TURN HE
TRIED ANOTHER BUT WITH THE SAME RESULT NIGHT WAS COMING ON RAPIDLY
AND IT WAS ALMOST DARK BEFORE HE AT LAST FOUND HIMSELF IN A DEFILE
WHICH WAS FAMILIAR TO HIM EVEN THEN IT WAS NO EASY MATTER TO KEEP TO
THE RIGHT TRACK FOR THE MOON HAD NOT YET RISEN AND THE HIGH CLIFFS
ON EITHER SIDE MADE THE OBSCURITY MORE PROFOUND WEIGHED DOWN WITH
HIS BURDEN AND WEARY FROM HIS EXERTIONS HE STUMBLED ALONG KEEPING
UP HIS HEART BY THE REFLECTION THAT EVERY STEP BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO
LUCY AND THAT HE CARRIED WITH HIM ENOUGH TO ENSURE THEM FOOD FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THEIR JOURNEY
HE HAD NOW COME TO THE MOUTH OF THE VERY DEFILE IN WHICH HE HAD LEFT
THEM EVEN IN THE DARKNESS HE COULD RECOGNIZE THE OUTLINE OF THE
CLIFFS WHICH BOUNDED IT THEY MUST HE REFLECTED BE AWAITING HIM
ANXIOUSLY FOR HE HAD BEEN ABSENT NEARLY FIVE HOURS IN THE GLADNESS
OF HIS HEART HE PUT HIS HANDS TO HIS MOUTH AND MADE THE GLEN REECHO
TO A LOUD HALLOO AS A SIGNAL THAT HE WAS COMING HE PAUSED AND
LISTENED FOR AN ANSWER NONE CAME SAVE HIS OWN CRY WHICH CLATTERED
UP THE DREARY SILENT RAVINES AND WAS BORNE BACK TO HIS EARS IN
COUNTLESS REPETITIONS AGAIN HE SHOUTED EVEN LOUDER THAN BEFORE AND
AGAIN NO WHISPER CAME BACK FROM THE FRIENDS WHOM HE HAD LEFT SUCH A
SHORT TIME AGO A VAGUE NAMELESS DREAD CAME OVER HIM AND HE HURRIED
ONWARDS FRANTICALLY DROPPING THE PRECIOUS FOOD IN HIS AGITATION
WHEN HE TURNED THE CORNER HE CAME FULL IN SIGHT OF THE SPOT WHERE
THE FIRE HAD BEEN LIT THERE WAS STILL A GLOWING PILE OF WOOD ASHES
THERE BUT IT HAD EVIDENTLY NOT BEEN TENDED SINCE HIS DEPARTURE THE
SAME DEAD SILENCE STILL REIGNED ALL ROUND WITH HIS FEARS ALL CHANGED
TO CONVICTIONS HE HURRIED ON THERE WAS NO LIVING CREATURE NEAR THE
REMAINS OF THE FIRE ANIMALS MAN MAIDEN ALL WERE GONE IT WAS ONLY
TOO CLEAR THAT SOME SUDDEN AND TERRIBLE DISASTER HAD OCCURRED DURING
HIS ABSENCEA DISASTER WHICH HAD EMBRACED THEM ALL AND YET HAD LEFT
NO TRACES BEHIND IT
BEWILDERED AND STUNNED BY THIS BLOW JEFFERSON HOPE FELT HIS HEAD
SPIN ROUND AND HAD TO LEAN UPON HIS RIFLE TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM
FALLING HE WAS ESSENTIALLY A MAN OF ACTION HOWEVER AND SPEEDILY
RECOVERED FROM HIS TEMPORARY IMPOTENCE SEIZING A HALFCONSUMED PIECE
OF WOOD FROM THE SMOULDERING FIRE HE BLEW IT INTO A FLAME AND
PROCEEDED WITH ITS HELP TO EXAMINE THE LITTLE CAMP THE GROUND WAS
ALL STAMPED DOWN BY THE FEET OF HORSES SHOWING THAT A LARGE PARTY OF
MOUNTED MEN HAD OVERTAKEN THE FUGITIVES AND THE DIRECTION OF THEIR
TRACKS PROVED THAT THEY HAD AFTERWARDS TURNED BACK TO SALT LAKE CITY
HAD THEY CARRIED BACK BOTH OF HIS COMPANIONS WITH THEM JEFFERSON
HOPE HAD ALMOST PERSUADED HIMSELF THAT THEY MUST HAVE DONE SO WHEN
HIS EYE FELL UPON AN OBJECT WHICH MADE EVERY NERVE OF HIS BODY TINGLE
WITHIN HIM A LITTLE WAY ON ONE SIDE OF THE CAMP WAS A LOWLYING HEAP
OF REDDISH SOIL WHICH HAD ASSUREDLY NOT BEEN THERE BEFORE THERE WAS
NO MISTAKING IT FOR ANYTHING BUT A NEWLYDUG GRAVE AS THE YOUNG
HUNTER APPROACHED IT HE PERCEIVED THAT A STICK HAD BEEN PLANTED ON
IT WITH A SHEET OF PAPER STUCK IN THE CLEFT FORK OF IT THE
INSCRIPTION UPON THE PAPER WAS BRIEF BUT TO THE POINT
JOHN FERRIER
FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY
DIED AUGUST TH THE STURDY OLD MAN WHOM HE HAD LEFT SO SHORT A TIME
BEFORE WAS
GONE THEN AND THIS WAS ALL HIS EPITAPH JEFFERSON HOPE LOOKED
WILDLY ROUND TO SEE IF THERE WAS A SECOND GRAVE BUT THERE WAS NO
SIGN OF ONE LUCY HAD BEEN CARRIED BACK BY THEIR TERRIBLE PURSUERS TO
FULFIL HER ORIGINAL DESTINY BY BECOMING ONE OF THE HAREM OF THE
ELDERS SON AS THE YOUNG FELLOW REALIZED THE CERTAINTY OF HER FATE
AND HIS OWN POWERLESSNESS TO PREVENT IT HE WISHED THAT HE TOO WAS
LYING WITH THE OLD FARMER IN HIS LAST SILENT RESTINGPLACE
AGAIN HOWEVER HIS ACTIVE SPIRIT SHOOK OFF THE LETHARGY WHICH
SPRINGS FROM DESPAIR IF THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE LEFT TO HIM HE COULD
AT LEAST DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO REVENGE WITH INDOMITABLE PATIENCE AND
PERSEVERANCE JEFFERSON HOPE POSSESSED ALSO A POWER OF SUSTAINED
VINDICTIVENESS WHICH HE MAY HAVE LEARNED FROM THE INDIANS AMONGST
WHOM HE HAD LIVED AS HE STOOD BY THE DESOLATE FIRE HE FELT THAT THE
ONLY ONE THING WHICH COULD ASSUAGE HIS GRIEF WOULD BE THOROUGH AND
COMPLETE RETRIBUTION BROUGHT BY HIS OWN HAND UPON HIS ENEMIES HIS
STRONG WILL AND UNTIRING ENERGY SHOULD HE DETERMINED BE DEVOTED TO
THAT ONE END WITH A GRIM WHITE FACE HE RETRACED HIS STEPS TO WHERE
HE HAD DROPPED THE FOOD AND HAVING STIRRED UP THE SMOULDERING FIRE
HE COOKED ENOUGH TO LAST HIM FOR A FEW DAYS THIS HE MADE UP INTO A
BUNDLE AND TIRED AS HE WAS HE SET HIMSELF TO WALK BACK THROUGH THE
MOUNTAINS UPON THE TRACK OF THE AVENGING ANGELS
FOR FIVE DAYS HE TOILED FOOTSORE AND WEARY THROUGH THE DEFILES WHICH
HE HAD ALREADY TRAVERSED ON HORSEBACK AT NIGHT HE FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN
AMONG THE ROCKS AND SNATCHED A FEW HOURS OF SLEEP BUT BEFORE
DAYBREAK HE WAS ALWAYS WELL ON HIS WAY ON THE SIXTH DAY HE REACHED
THE EAGLE CAON FROM WHICH THEY HAD COMMENCED THEIR ILLFATED
FLIGHT THENCE HE COULD LOOK DOWN UPON THE HOME OF THE SAINTS WORN
AND EXHAUSTED HE LEANED UPON HIS RIFLE AND SHOOK HIS GAUNT HAND
FIERCELY AT THE SILENT WIDESPREAD CITY BENEATH HIM AS HE LOOKED AT
IT HE OBSERVED THAT THERE WERE FLAGS IN SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL
STREETS AND OTHER SIGNS OF FESTIVITY HE WAS STILL SPECULATING AS TO
WHAT THIS MIGHT MEAN WHEN HE HEARD THE CLATTER OF HORSES HOOFS AND
SAW A MOUNTED MAN RIDING TOWARDS HIM AS HE APPROACHED HE RECOGNIZED
HIM AS A MORMON NAMED COWPER TO WHOM HE HAD RENDERED SERVICES AT
DIFFERENT TIMES HE THEREFORE ACCOSTED HIM WHEN HE GOT UP TO HIM
WITH THE OBJECT OF FINDING OUT WHAT LUCY FERRIERS FATE HAD BEEN
I AM JEFFERSON HOPE HE SAID YOU REMEMBER ME
THE MORMON LOOKED AT HIM WITH UNDISGUISED ASTONISHMENTINDEED IT
WAS DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE IN THIS TATTERED UNKEMPT WANDERER WITH
GHASTLY WHITE FACE AND FIERCE WILD EYES THE SPRUCE YOUNG HUNTER OF
FORMER DAYS HAVING HOWEVER AT LAST SATISFIED HIMSELF AS TO HIS
IDENTITY THE MANS SURPRISE CHANGED TO CONSTERNATION
YOU ARE MAD TO COME HERE HE CRIED IT IS AS MUCH AS MY OWN LIFE
IS WORTH TO BE SEEN TALKING WITH YOU THERE IS A WARRANT AGAINST YOU
FROM THE HOLY FOUR FOR ASSISTING THE FERRIERS AWAY
I DONT FEAR THEM OR THEIR WARRANT HOPE SAID EARNESTLY YOU
MUST KNOW SOMETHING OF THIS MATTER COWPER I CONJURE YOU BY
EVERYTHING YOU HOLD DEAR TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS WE HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN FRIENDS FOR GODS SAKE DONT REFUSE TO ANSWER ME
WHAT IS IT THE MORMON ASKED UNEASILY BE QUICK THE VERY ROCKS
HAVE EARS AND THE TREES EYES
WHAT HAS BECOME OF LUCY FERRIER
SHE WAS MARRIED YESTERDAY TO YOUNG DREBBER HOLD UP MAN HOLD UP
YOU HAVE NO LIFE LEFT IN YOU
DONT MIND ME SAID HOPE FAINTLY HE WAS WHITE TO THE VERY LIPS
AND HAD SUNK DOWN ON THE STONE AGAINST WHICH HE HAD BEEN LEANING
MARRIED YOU SAY
MARRIED YESTERDAYTHATS WHAT THOSE FLAGS ARE FOR ON THE ENDOWMENT
HOUSE THERE WAS SOME WORDS BETWEEN YOUNG DREBBER AND YOUNG
STANGERSON AS TO WHICH WAS TO HAVE HER THEYD BOTH BEEN IN THE PARTY
THAT FOLLOWED THEM AND STANGERSON HAD SHOT HER FATHER WHICH SEEMED
TO GIVE HIM THE BEST CLAIM BUT WHEN THEY ARGUED IT OUT IN COUNCIL
DREBBERS PARTY WAS THE STRONGER SO THE PROPHET GAVE HER OVER TO
HIM NO ONE WONT HAVE HER VERY LONG THOUGH FOR I SAW DEATH IN HER
FACE YESTERDAY SHE IS MORE LIKE A GHOST THAN A WOMAN ARE YOU OFF
THEN
YES I AM OFF SAID JEFFERSON HOPE WHO HAD RISEN FROM HIS SEAT
HIS FACE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CHISELLED OUT OF MARBLE SO HARD AND SET WAS
ITS EXPRESSION WHILE ITS EYES GLOWED WITH A BALEFUL LIGHT
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
NEVER MIND HE ANSWERED AND SLINGING HIS WEAPON OVER HIS
SHOULDER STRODE OFF DOWN THE GORGE AND SO AWAY INTO THE HEART OF THE
MOUNTAINS TO THE HAUNTS OF THE WILD BEASTS AMONGST THEM ALL THERE
WAS NONE SO FIERCE AND SO DANGEROUS AS HIMSELF
THE PREDICTION OF THE MORMON WAS ONLY TOO WELL FULFILLED WHETHER IT
WAS THE TERRIBLE DEATH OF HER FATHER OR THE EFFECTS OF THE HATEFUL
MARRIAGE INTO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN FORCED POOR LUCY NEVER HELD UP HER
HEAD AGAIN BUT PINED AWAY AND DIED WITHIN A MONTH HER SOTTISH
HUSBAND WHO HAD MARRIED HER PRINCIPALLY FOR THE SAKE OF JOHN
FERRIERS PROPERTY DID NOT AFFECT ANY GREAT GRIEF AT HIS
BEREAVEMENT BUT HIS OTHER WIVES MOURNED OVER HER AND SAT UP WITH
HER THE NIGHT BEFORE THE BURIAL AS IS THE MORMON CUSTOM THEY WERE
GROUPED ROUND THE BIER IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING WHEN TO
THEIR INEXPRESSIBLE FEAR AND ASTONISHMENT THE DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN
AND A SAVAGELOOKING WEATHERBEATEN MAN IN TATTERED GARMENTS STRODE
INTO THE ROOM WITHOUT A GLANCE OR A WORD TO THE COWERING WOMEN HE
WALKED UP TO THE WHITE SILENT FIGURE WHICH HAD ONCE CONTAINED THE
PURE SOUL OF LUCY FERRIER STOOPING OVER HER HE PRESSED HIS LIPS
REVERENTLY TO HER COLD FOREHEAD AND THEN SNATCHING UP HER HAND HE
TOOK THE WEDDINGRING FROM HER FINGER SHE SHALL NOT BE BURIED IN
THAT HE CRIED WITH A FIERCE SNARL AND BEFORE AN ALARM COULD BE
RAISED SPRANG DOWN THE STAIRS AND WAS GONE SO STRANGE AND SO BRIEF
WAS THE EPISODE THAT THE WATCHERS MIGHT HAVE FOUND IT HARD TO
BELIEVE IT THEMSELVES OR PERSUADE OTHER PEOPLE OF IT HAD IT NOT BEEN
FOR THE UNDENIABLE FACT THAT THE CIRCLET OF GOLD WHICH MARKED HER AS
HAVING BEEN A BRIDE HAD DISAPPEARED
FOR SOME MONTHS JEFFERSON HOPE LINGERED AMONG THE MOUNTAINS LEADING
A STRANGE WILD LIFE AND NURSING IN HIS HEART THE FIERCE DESIRE FOR
VENGEANCE WHICH POSSESSED HIM TALES WERE TOLD IN THE CITY OF THE
WEIRD FIGURE WHICH WAS SEEN PROWLING ABOUT THE SUBURBS AND WHICH
HAUNTED THE LONELY MOUNTAIN GORGES ONCE A BULLET WHISTLED THROUGH
STANGERSONS WINDOW AND FLATTENED ITSELF UPON THE WALL WITHIN A FOOT
OF HIM ON ANOTHER OCCASION AS DREBBER PASSED UNDER A CLIFF A GREAT
BOULDER CRASHED DOWN ON HIM AND HE ONLY ESCAPED A TERRIBLE DEATH BY
THROWING HIMSELF UPON HIS FACE THE TWO YOUNG MORMONS WERE NOT LONG
IN DISCOVERING THE REASON OF THESE ATTEMPTS UPON THEIR LIVES AND LED
REPEATED EXPEDITIONS INTO THE MOUNTAINS IN THE HOPE OF CAPTURING OR
KILLING THEIR ENEMY BUT ALWAYS WITHOUT SUCCESS THEN THEY ADOPTED
THE PRECAUTION OF NEVER GOING OUT ALONE OR AFTER NIGHTFALL AND OF
HAVING THEIR HOUSES GUARDED AFTER A TIME THEY WERE ABLE TO RELAX
THESE MEASURES FOR NOTHING WAS EITHER HEARD OR SEEN OF THEIR
OPPONENT AND THEY HOPED THAT TIME HAD COOLED HIS VINDICTIVENESS
FAR FROM DOING SO IT HAD IF ANYTHING AUGMENTED IT THE HUNTERS
MIND WAS OF A HARD UNYIELDING NATURE AND THE PREDOMINANT IDEA OF
REVENGE HAD TAKEN SUCH COMPLETE POSSESSION OF IT THAT THERE WAS NO
ROOM FOR ANY OTHER EMOTION HE WAS HOWEVER ABOVE ALL THINGS
PRACTICAL HE SOON REALIZED THAT EVEN HIS IRON CONSTITUTION COULD NOT
STAND THE INCESSANT STRAIN WHICH HE WAS PUTTING UPON IT EXPOSURE AND
WANT OF WHOLESOME FOOD WERE WEARING HIM OUT IF HE DIED LIKE A DOG
AMONG THE MOUNTAINS WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF HIS REVENGE THEN AND YET
SUCH A DEATH WAS SURE TO OVERTAKE HIM IF HE PERSISTED HE FELT THAT
THAT WAS TO PLAY HIS ENEMYS GAME SO HE RELUCTANTLY RETURNED TO THE
OLD NEVADA MINES THERE TO RECRUIT HIS HEALTH AND TO AMASS MONEY
ENOUGH TO ALLOW HIM TO PURSUE HIS OBJECT WITHOUT PRIVATION
HIS INTENTION HAD BEEN TO BE ABSENT A YEAR AT THE MOST BUT A
COMBINATION OF UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES PREVENTED HIS LEAVING THE
MINES FOR NEARLY FIVE AT THE END OF THAT TIME HOWEVER HIS MEMORY
OF HIS WRONGS AND HIS CRAVING FOR REVENGE WERE QUITE AS KEEN AS ON
THAT MEMORABLE NIGHT WHEN HE HAD STOOD BY JOHN FERRIERS GRAVE
DISGUISED AND UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME HE RETURNED TO SALT LAKE CITY
CARELESS WHAT BECAME OF HIS OWN LIFE AS LONG AS HE OBTAINED WHAT HE
KNEW TO BE JUSTICE THERE HE FOUND EVIL TIDINGS AWAITING HIM THERE
HAD BEEN A SCHISM AMONG THE CHOSEN PEOPLE A FEW MONTHS BEFORE SOME
OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH HAVING REBELLED AGAINST THE
AUTHORITY OF THE ELDERS AND THE RESULT HAD BEEN THE SECESSION OF A
CERTAIN NUMBER OF THE MALCONTENTS WHO HAD LEFT UTAH AND BECOME
GENTILES AMONG THESE HAD BEEN DREBBER AND STANGERSON AND NO ONE
KNEW WHITHER THEY HAD GONE RUMOUR REPORTED THAT DREBBER HAD MANAGED
TO CONVERT A LARGE PART OF HIS PROPERTY INTO MONEY AND THAT HE HAD
DEPARTED A WEALTHY MAN WHILE HIS COMPANION STANGERSON WAS
COMPARATIVELY POOR THERE WAS NO CLUE AT ALL HOWEVER AS TO THEIR
WHEREABOUTS
MANY A MAN HOWEVER VINDICTIVE WOULD HAVE ABANDONED ALL THOUGHT OF
REVENGE IN THE FACE OF SUCH A DIFFICULTY BUT JEFFERSON HOPE NEVER
FALTERED FOR A MOMENT WITH THE SMALL COMPETENCE HE POSSESSED EKED
OUT BY SUCH EMPLOYMENT AS HE COULD PICK UP HE TRAVELLED FROM TOWN TO
TOWN THROUGH THE UNITED STATES IN QUEST OF HIS ENEMIES YEAR PASSED
INTO YEAR HIS BLACK HAIR TURNED GRIZZLED BUT STILL HE WANDERED ON
A HUMAN BLOODHOUND WITH HIS MIND WHOLLY SET UPON THE ONE OBJECT UPON
WHICH HE HAD DEVOTED HIS LIFE AT LAST HIS PERSEVERANCE WAS REWARDED
IT WAS BUT A GLANCE OF A FACE IN A WINDOW BUT THAT ONE GLANCE TOLD
HIM THAT CLEVELAND IN OHIO POSSESSED THE MEN WHOM HE WAS IN PURSUIT
OF HE RETURNED TO HIS MISERABLE LODGINGS WITH HIS PLAN OF VENGEANCE
ALL ARRANGED IT CHANCED HOWEVER THAT DREBBER LOOKING FROM HIS
WINDOW HAD RECOGNIZED THE VAGRANT IN THE STREET AND HAD READ MURDER
IN HIS EYES HE HURRIED BEFORE A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE ACCOMPANIED BY
STANGERSON WHO HAD BECOME HIS PRIVATE SECRETARY AND REPRESENTED TO
HIM THAT THEY WERE IN DANGER OF THEIR LIVES FROM THE JEALOUSY AND
HATRED OF AN OLD RIVAL THAT EVENING JEFFERSON HOPE WAS TAKEN INTO
CUSTODY AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND SURETIES WAS DETAINED FOR SOME
WEEKS WHEN AT LAST HE WAS LIBERATED IT WAS ONLY TO FIND THAT
DREBBERS HOUSE WAS DESERTED AND THAT HE AND HIS SECRETARY HAD
DEPARTED FOR EUROPE
AGAIN THE AVENGER HAD BEEN FOILED AND AGAIN HIS CONCENTRATED HATRED
URGED HIM TO CONTINUE THE PURSUIT FUNDS WERE WANTING HOWEVER AND
FOR SOME TIME HE HAD TO RETURN TO WORK SAVING EVERY DOLLAR FOR HIS
APPROACHING JOURNEY AT LAST HAVING COLLECTED ENOUGH TO KEEP LIFE IN
HIM HE DEPARTED FOR EUROPE AND TRACKED HIS ENEMIES FROM CITY TO
CITY WORKING HIS WAY IN ANY MENIAL CAPACITY BUT NEVER OVERTAKING
THE FUGITIVES WHEN HE REACHED ST PETERSBURG THEY HAD DEPARTED FOR
PARIS AND WHEN HE FOLLOWED THEM THERE HE LEARNED THAT THEY HAD JUST
SET OFF FOR COPENHAGEN AT THE DANISH CAPITAL HE WAS AGAIN A FEW DAYS
LATE FOR THEY HAD JOURNEYED ON TO LONDON WHERE HE AT LAST SUCCEEDED
IN RUNNING THEM TO EARTH AS TO WHAT OCCURRED THERE WE CANNOT DO
BETTER THAN QUOTE THE OLD HUNTERS OWN ACCOUNT AS DULY RECORDED IN
DR WATSONS JOURNAL TO WHICH WE ARE ALREADY UNDER SUCH OBLIGATIONS
CHAPTER VI
A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON MD
OUR PRISONERS FURIOUS RESISTANCE DID NOT APPARENTLY INDICATE ANY
FEROCITY IN HIS DISPOSITION TOWARDS OURSELVES FOR ON FINDING HIMSELF
POWERLESS HE SMILED IN AN AFFABLE MANNER AND EXPRESSED HIS HOPES
THAT HE HAD NOT HURT ANY OF US IN THE SCUFFLE I GUESS YOURE GOING
TO TAKE ME TO THE POLICESTATION HE REMARKED TO SHERLOCK HOLMES
MY CABS AT THE DOOR IF YOULL LOOSE MY LEGS ILL WALK DOWN TO IT
IM NOT SO LIGHT TO LIFT AS I USED TO BE
GREGSON AND LESTRADE EXCHANGED GLANCES AS IF THEY THOUGHT THIS
PROPOSITION RATHER A BOLD ONE BUT HOLMES AT ONCE TOOK THE PRISONER
AT HIS WORD AND LOOSENED THE TOWEL WHICH WE HAD BOUND ROUND HIS
ANKLES HE ROSE AND STRETCHED HIS LEGS AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HIMSELF
THAT THEY WERE FREE ONCE MORE I REMEMBER THAT I THOUGHT TO MYSELF
AS I EYED HIM THAT I HAD SELDOM SEEN A MORE POWERFULLY BUILT MAN
AND HIS DARK SUNBURNED FACE BORE AN EXPRESSION OF DETERMINATION AND
ENERGY WHICH WAS AS FORMIDABLE AS HIS PERSONAL STRENGTH
IF THERES A VACANT PLACE FOR A CHIEF OF THE POLICE I RECKON YOU
ARE THE MAN FOR IT HE SAID GAZING WITH UNDISGUISED ADMIRATION AT
MY FELLOWLODGER THE WAY YOU KEPT ON MY TRAIL WAS A CAUTION
YOU HAD BETTER COME WITH ME SAID HOLMES TO THE TWO DETECTIVES
I CAN DRIVE YOU SAID LESTRADE
GOOD AND GREGSON CAN COME INSIDE WITH ME YOU TOO DOCTOR YOU HAVE
TAKEN AN INTEREST IN THE CASE AND MAY AS WELL STICK TO US
I ASSENTED GLADLY AND WE ALL DESCENDED TOGETHER OUR PRISONER MADE
NO ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE BUT STEPPED CALMLY INTO THE CAB WHICH HAD BEEN
HIS AND WE FOLLOWED HIM LESTRADE MOUNTED THE BOX WHIPPED UP THE
HORSE AND BROUGHT US IN A VERY SHORT TIME TO OUR DESTINATION WE
WERE USHERED INTO A SMALL CHAMBER WHERE A POLICE INSPECTOR NOTED DOWN
OUR PRISONERS NAME AND THE NAMES OF THE MEN WITH WHOSE MURDER HE HAD
BEEN CHARGED THE OFFICIAL WAS A WHITEFACED UNEMOTIONAL MAN WHO
WENT THROUGH HIS DUTIES IN A DULL MECHANICAL WAY THE PRISONER WILL
BE PUT BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES IN THE COURSE OF THE WEEK HE SAID
IN THE MEAN TIME MR JEFFERSON HOPE HAVE YOU ANYTHING THAT YOU
WISH TO SAY I MUST WARN YOU THAT YOUR WORDS WILL BE TAKEN DOWN AND
MAY BE USED AGAINST YOU
IVE GOT A GOOD DEAL TO SAY OUR PRISONER SAID SLOWLY I WANT TO
TELL YOU GENTLEMEN ALL ABOUT IT
HADNT YOU BETTER RESERVE THAT FOR YOUR TRIAL ASKED THE INSPECTOR
I MAY NEVER BE TRIED HE ANSWERED YOU NEEDNT LOOK STARTLED IT
ISNT SUICIDE I AM THINKING OF ARE YOU A DOCTOR HE TURNED HIS
FIERCE DARK EYES UPON ME AS HE ASKED THIS LAST QUESTION
YES I AM I ANSWERED
THEN PUT YOUR HAND HERE HE SAID WITH A SMILE MOTIONING WITH HIS
MANACLED WRISTS TOWARDS HIS CHEST
I DID SO AND BECAME AT ONCE CONSCIOUS OF AN EXTRAORDINARY THROBBING
AND COMMOTION WHICH WAS GOING ON INSIDE THE WALLS OF HIS CHEST
SEEMED TO THRILL AND QUIVER AS A FRAIL BUILDING WOULD DO INSIDE WHEN
SOME POWERFUL ENGINE WAS AT WORK IN THE SILENCE OF THE ROOM I COULD
HEAR A DULL HUMMING AND BUZZING NOISE WHICH PROCEEDED FROM THE SAME
SOURCE
WHY I CRIED YOU HAVE AN AORTIC ANEURISM
THATS WHAT THEY CALL IT HE SAID PLACIDLY I WENT TO A DOCTOR
LAST WEEK ABOUT IT AND HE TOLD ME THAT IT IS BOUND TO BURST BEFORE
MANY DAYS PASSED IT HAS BEEN GETTING WORSE FOR YEARS I GOT IT FROM
OVEREXPOSURE AND UNDERFEEDING AMONG THE SALT LAKE MOUNTAINS IVE
DONE MY WORK NOW AND I DONT CARE HOW SOON I GO BUT I SHOULD LIKE
TO LEAVE SOME ACCOUNT OF THE BUSINESS BEHIND ME I DONT WANT TO BE
REMEMBERED AS A COMMON CUTTHROAT
THE INSPECTOR AND THE TWO DETECTIVES HAD A HURRIED DISCUSSION AS TO
THE ADVISABILITY OF ALLOWING HIM TO TELL HIS STORY
DO YOU CONSIDER DOCTOR THAT THERE IS IMMEDIATE DANGER THE FORMER
ASKED
MOST CERTAINLY THERE IS I ANSWERED
IN THAT CASE IT IS CLEARLY OUR DUTY IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE TO
TAKE HIS STATEMENT SAID THE INSPECTOR YOU ARE AT LIBERTY SIR TO
GIVE YOUR ACCOUNT WHICH I AGAIN WARN YOU WILL BE TAKEN DOWN
ILL SIT DOWN WITH YOUR LEAVE THE PRISONER SAID SUITING THE
ACTION TO THE WORD THIS ANEURISM OF MINE MAKES ME EASILY TIRED AND
THE TUSSLE WE HAD HALF AN HOUR AGO HAS NOT MENDED MATTERS IM ON THE
BRINK OF THE GRAVE AND I AM NOT LIKELY TO LIE TO YOU EVERY WORD I
SAY IS THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH AND HOW YOU USE IT IS A MATTER OF NO
CONSEQUENCE TO ME
WITH THESE WORDS JEFFERSON HOPE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND BEGAN
THE FOLLOWING REMARKABLE STATEMENT HE SPOKE IN A CALM AND METHODICAL
MANNER AS THOUGH THE EVENTS WHICH HE NARRATED WERE COMMONPLACE
ENOUGH I CAN VOUCH FOR THE ACCURACY OF THE SUBJOINED ACCOUNT FOR I
HAVE HAD ACCESS TO LESTRADES NOTEBOOK IN WHICH THE PRISONERS
WORDS WERE TAKEN DOWN EXACTLY AS THEY WERE UTTERED
IT DONT MUCH MATTER TO YOU WHY I HATED THESE MEN HE SAID ITS
ENOUGH THAT THEY WERE GUILTY OF THE DEATH OF TWO HUMAN BEINGSA
FATHER AND A DAUGHTERAND THAT THEY HAD THEREFORE FORFEITED THEIR
OWN LIVES AFTER THE LAPSE OF TIME THAT HAS PASSED SINCE THEIR CRIME
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SECURE A CONVICTION AGAINST THEM IN ANY
COURT I KNEW OF THEIR GUILT THOUGH AND I DETERMINED THAT I SHOULD
BE JUDGE JURY AND EXECUTIONER ALL ROLLED INTO ONE YOUD HAVE DONE
THE SAME IF YOU HAVE ANY MANHOOD IN YOU IF YOU HAD BEEN IN MY
PLACE
THAT GIRL THAT I SPOKE OF WAS TO HAVE MARRIED ME TWENTY YEARS AGO
SHE WAS FORCED INTO MARRYING THAT SAME DREBBER AND BROKE HER HEART
OVER IT I TOOK THE MARRIAGE RING FROM HER DEAD FINGER AND I VOWED
THAT HIS DYING EYES SHOULD REST UPON THAT VERY RING AND THAT HIS
LAST THOUGHTS SHOULD BE OF THE CRIME FOR WHICH HE WAS PUNISHED I
HAVE CARRIED IT ABOUT WITH ME AND HAVE FOLLOWED HIM AND HIS
ACCOMPLICE OVER TWO CONTINENTS UNTIL I CAUGHT THEM THEY THOUGHT TO
TIRE ME OUT BUT THEY COULD NOT DO IT IF I DIE TOMORROW AS IS
LIKELY ENOUGH I DIE KNOWING THAT MY WORK IN THIS WORLD IS DONE AND
WELL DONE THEY HAVE PERISHED AND BY MY HAND THERE IS NOTHING LEFT
FOR ME TO HOPE FOR OR TO DESIRE
THEY WERE RICH AND I WAS POOR SO THAT IT WAS NO EASY MATTER FOR ME
TO FOLLOW THEM WHEN I GOT TO LONDON MY POCKET WAS ABOUT EMPTY AND I
FOUND THAT I MUST TURN MY HAND TO SOMETHING FOR MY LIVING DRIVING
AND RIDING ARE AS NATURAL TO ME AS WALKING SO I APPLIED AT A
CABOWNERS OFFICE AND SOON GOT EMPLOYMENT I WAS TO BRING A CERTAIN
SUM A WEEK TO THE OWNER AND WHATEVER WAS OVER THAT I MIGHT KEEP FOR
MYSELF THERE WAS SELDOM MUCH OVER BUT I MANAGED TO SCRAPE ALONG
SOMEHOW THE HARDEST JOB WAS TO LEARN MY WAY ABOUT FOR I RECKON THAT
OF ALL THE MAZES THAT EVER WERE CONTRIVED THIS CITY IS THE MOST
CONFUSING I HAD A MAP BESIDE ME THOUGH AND WHEN ONCE I HAD SPOTTED
THE PRINCIPAL HOTELS AND STATIONS I GOT ON PRETTY WELL
IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE I FOUND OUT WHERE MY TWO GENTLEMEN WERE
LIVING BUT I INQUIRED AND INQUIRED UNTIL AT LAST I DROPPED ACROSS
THEM THEY WERE AT A BOARDINGHOUSE AT CAMBERWELL OVER ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE RIVER WHEN ONCE I FOUND THEM OUT I KNEW THAT I HAD THEM
AT MY MERCY I HAD GROWN MY BEARD AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF THEIR
RECOGNIZING ME I WOULD DOG THEM AND FOLLOW THEM UNTIL I SAW MY
OPPORTUNITY I WAS DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT ESCAPE ME AGAIN
THEY WERE VERY NEAR DOING IT FOR ALL THAT GO WHERE THEY WOULD ABOUT
LONDON I WAS ALWAYS AT THEIR HEELS SOMETIMES I FOLLOWED THEM ON MY
CAB AND SOMETIMES ON FOOT BUT THE FORMER WAS THE BEST FOR THEN
THEY COULD NOT GET AWAY FROM ME IT WAS ONLY EARLY IN THE MORNING OR
LATE AT NIGHT THAT I COULD EARN ANYTHING SO THAT I BEGAN TO GET
BEHIND HAND WITH MY EMPLOYER I DID NOT MIND THAT HOWEVER AS LONG
AS I COULD LAY MY HAND UPON THE MEN I WANTED
THEY WERE VERY CUNNING THOUGH THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT THAT THERE
WAS SOME CHANCE OF THEIR BEING FOLLOWED FOR THEY WOULD NEVER GO OUT
ALONE AND NEVER AFTER NIGHTFALL DURING TWO WEEKS I DROVE BEHIND
THEM EVERY DAY AND NEVER ONCE SAW THEM SEPARATE DREBBER HIMSELF WAS
DRUNK HALF THE TIME BUT STANGERSON WAS NOT TO BE CAUGHT NAPPING I
WATCHED THEM LATE AND EARLY BUT NEVER SAW THE GHOST OF A CHANCE BUT
I WAS NOT DISCOURAGED FOR SOMETHING TOLD ME THAT THE HOUR HAD ALMOST
COME MY ONLY FEAR WAS THAT THIS THING IN MY CHEST MIGHT BURST A
LITTLE TOO SOON AND LEAVE MY WORK UNDONE
AT LAST ONE EVENING I WAS DRIVING UP AND DOWN TORQUAY TERRACE AS
THE STREET WAS CALLED IN WHICH THEY BOARDED WHEN I SAW A CAB DRIVE
UP TO THEIR DOOR PRESENTLY SOME LUGGAGE WAS BROUGHT OUT AND AFTER A
TIME DREBBER AND STANGERSON FOLLOWED IT AND DROVE OFF I WHIPPED UP
MY HORSE AND KEPT WITHIN SIGHT OF THEM FEELING VERY ILL AT EASE FOR
I FEARED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SHIFT THEIR QUARTERS AT EUSTON
STATION THEY GOT OUT AND I LEFT A BOY TO HOLD MY HORSE AND FOLLOWED
THEM ON TO THE PLATFORM I HEARD THEM ASK FOR THE LIVERPOOL TRAIN
AND THE GUARD ANSWER THAT ONE HAD JUST GONE AND THERE WOULD NOT BE
ANOTHER FOR SOME HOURS STANGERSON SEEMED TO BE PUT OUT AT THAT BUT
DREBBER WAS RATHER PLEASED THAN OTHERWISE I GOT SO CLOSE TO THEM IN
THE BUSTLE THAT I COULD HEAR EVERY WORD THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM
DREBBER SAID THAT HE HAD A LITTLE BUSINESS OF HIS OWN TO DO AND THAT
IF THE OTHER WOULD WAIT FOR HIM HE WOULD SOON REJOIN HIM HIS
COMPANION REMONSTRATED WITH HIM AND REMINDED HIM THAT THEY HAD
RESOLVED TO STICK TOGETHER DREBBER ANSWERED THAT THE MATTER WAS A
DELICATE ONE AND THAT HE MUST GO ALONE I COULD NOT CATCH WHAT
STANGERSON SAID TO THAT BUT THE OTHER BURST OUT SWEARING AND
REMINDED HIM THAT HE WAS NOTHING MORE THAN HIS PAID SERVANT AND THAT
HE MUST NOT PRESUME TO DICTATE TO HIM ON THAT THE SECRETARY GAVE IT
UP AS A BAD JOB AND SIMPLY BARGAINED WITH HIM THAT IF HE MISSED THE
LAST TRAIN HE SHOULD REJOIN HIM AT HALLIDAYS PRIVATE HOTEL TO WHICH
DREBBER ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD BE BACK ON THE PLATFORM BEFORE ELEVEN
AND MADE HIS WAY OUT OF THE STATION
THE MOMENT FOR WHICH I HAD WAITED SO LONG HAD AT LAST COME I HAD MY
ENEMIES WITHIN MY POWER TOGETHER THEY COULD PROTECT EACH OTHER BUT
SINGLY THEY WERE AT MY MERCY I DID NOT ACT HOWEVER WITH UNDUE
PRECIPITATION MY PLANS WERE ALREADY FORMED THERE IS NO SATISFACTION
IN VENGEANCE UNLESS THE OFFENDER HAS TIME TO REALIZE WHO IT IS THAT
STRIKES HIM AND WHY RETRIBUTION HAS COME UPON HIM I HAD MY PLANS
ARRANGED BY WHICH I SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING THE MAN WHO
HAD WRONGED ME UNDERSTAND THAT HIS OLD SIN HAD FOUND HIM OUT IT
CHANCED THAT SOME DAYS BEFORE A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN
LOOKING OVER SOME HOUSES IN THE BRIXTON ROAD HAD DROPPED THE KEY OF
ONE OF THEM IN MY CARRIAGE IT WAS CLAIMED THAT SAME EVENING AND
RETURNED BUT IN THE INTERVAL I HAD TAKEN A MOULDING OF IT AND HAD A
DUPLICATE CONSTRUCTED BY MEANS OF THIS I HAD ACCESS TO AT LEAST ONE
SPOT IN THIS GREAT CITY WHERE I COULD RELY UPON BEING FREE FROM
INTERRUPTION HOW TO GET DREBBER TO THAT HOUSE WAS THE DIFFICULT
PROBLEM WHICH I HAD NOW TO SOLVE
HE WALKED DOWN THE ROAD AND WENT INTO ONE OR TWO LIQUOR SHOPS
STAYING FOR NEARLY HALFANHOUR IN THE LAST OF THEM WHEN HE CAME OUT
HE STAGGERED IN HIS WALK AND WAS EVIDENTLY PRETTY WELL ON THERE WAS
A HANSOM JUST IN FRONT OF ME AND HE HAILED IT I FOLLOWED IT SO
CLOSE THAT THE NOSE OF MY HORSE WAS WITHIN A YARD OF HIS DRIVER THE
WHOLE WAY WE RATTLED ACROSS WATERLOO BRIDGE AND THROUGH MILES OF
STREETS UNTIL TO MY ASTONISHMENT WE FOUND OURSELVES BACK IN THE
TERRACE IN WHICH HE HAD BOARDED I COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT HIS
INTENTION WAS IN RETURNING THERE BUT I WENT ON AND PULLED UP MY CAB
A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO FROM THE HOUSE HE ENTERED IT AND HIS HANSOM
DROVE AWAY GIVE ME A GLASS OF WATER IF YOU PLEASE MY MOUTH GETS
DRY WITH THE TALKING
I HANDED HIM THE GLASS AND HE DRANK IT DOWN
THATS BETTER HE SAID WELL I WAITED FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
OR MORE WHEN SUDDENLY THERE CAME A NOISE LIKE PEOPLE STRUGGLING
INSIDE THE HOUSE NEXT MOMENT THE DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN AND TWO MEN
APPEARED ONE OF WHOM WAS DREBBER AND THE OTHER WAS A YOUNG CHAP
WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE THIS FELLOW HAD DREBBER BY THE COLLAR
AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE HEAD OF THE STEPS HE GAVE HIM A SHOVE AND A
KICK WHICH SENT HIM HALF ACROSS THE ROAD YOU HOUND HE CRIED
SHAKING HIS STICK AT HIM ILL TEACH YOU TO INSULT AN HONEST GIRL
HE WAS SO HOT THAT I THINK HE WOULD HAVE THRASHED DREBBER WITH HIS
CUDGEL ONLY THAT THE CUR STAGGERED AWAY DOWN THE ROAD AS FAST AS HIS
LEGS WOULD CARRY HIM HE RAN AS FAR AS THE CORNER AND THEN SEEING
MY CAB HE HAILED ME AND JUMPED IN DRIVE ME TO HALLIDAYS PRIVATE
HOTEL SAID HE
WHEN I HAD HIM FAIRLY INSIDE MY CAB MY HEART JUMPED SO WITH JOY
THAT I FEARED LEST AT THIS LAST MOMENT MY ANEURISM MIGHT GO WRONG I
DROVE ALONG SLOWLY WEIGHING IN MY OWN MIND WHAT IT WAS BEST TO DO I
MIGHT TAKE HIM RIGHT OUT INTO THE COUNTRY AND THERE IN SOME DESERTED
LANE HAVE MY LAST INTERVIEW WITH HIM I HAD ALMOST DECIDED UPON THIS
WHEN HE SOLVED THE PROBLEM FOR ME THE CRAZE FOR DRINK HAD SEIZED HIM
AGAIN AND HE ORDERED ME TO PULL UP OUTSIDE A GIN PALACE HE WENT IN
LEAVING WORD THAT I SHOULD WAIT FOR HIM THERE HE REMAINED UNTIL
CLOSING TIME AND WHEN HE CAME OUT HE WAS SO FAR GONE THAT I KNEW THE
GAME WAS IN MY OWN HANDS
DONT IMAGINE THAT I INTENDED TO KILL HIM IN COLD BLOOD IT WOULD
ONLY HAVE BEEN RIGID JUSTICE IF I HAD DONE SO BUT I COULD NOT BRING
MYSELF TO DO IT I HAD LONG DETERMINED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A SHOW FOR
HIS LIFE IF HE CHOSE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AMONG THE MANY BILLETS
WHICH I HAVE FILLED IN AMERICA DURING MY WANDERING LIFE I WAS ONCE
JANITOR AND SWEEPER OUT OF THE LABORATORY AT YORK COLLEGE ONE DAY
THE PROFESSOR WAS LECTURING ON POISONS AND HE SHOWED HIS STUDENTS
SOME ALKALOID AS HE CALLED IT WHICH HE HAD EXTRACTED FROM SOME
SOUTH AMERICAN ARROW POISON AND WHICH WAS SO POWERFUL THAT THE LEAST
GRAIN MEANT INSTANT DEATH I SPOTTED THE BOTTLE IN WHICH THIS
PREPARATION WAS KEPT AND WHEN THEY WERE ALL GONE I HELPED MYSELF TO
A LITTLE OF IT I WAS A FAIRLY GOOD DISPENSER SO I WORKED THIS
ALKALOID INTO SMALL SOLUBLE PILLS AND EACH PILL I PUT IN A BOX WITH
A SIMILAR PILL MADE WITHOUT THE POISON I DETERMINED AT THE TIME THAT
WHEN I HAD MY CHANCE MY GENTLEMEN SHOULD EACH HAVE A DRAW OUT OF ONE
OF THESE BOXES WHILE I ATE THE PILL THAT REMAINED IT WOULD BE QUITE
AS DEADLY AND A GOOD DEAL LESS NOISY THAN FIRING ACROSS A
HANDKERCHIEF FROM THAT DAY I HAD ALWAYS MY PILL BOXES ABOUT WITH ME
AND THE TIME HAD NOW COME WHEN I WAS TO USE THEM
IT WAS NEARER ONE THAN TWELVE AND A WILD BLEAK NIGHT BLOWING HARD
AND RAINING IN TORRENTS DISMAL AS IT WAS OUTSIDE I WAS GLAD
WITHINSO GLAD THAT I COULD HAVE SHOUTED OUT FROM PURE EXULTATION
IF ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN HAVE EVER PINED FOR A THING AND LONGED FOR
IT DURING TWENTY LONG YEARS AND THEN SUDDENLY FOUND IT WITHIN YOUR
REACH YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND MY FEELINGS I LIT A CIGAR AND PUFFED AT
IT TO STEADY MY NERVES BUT MY HANDS WERE TREMBLING AND MY TEMPLES
THROBBING WITH EXCITEMENT AS I DROVE I COULD SEE OLD JOHN FERRIER
AND SWEET LUCY LOOKING AT ME OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND SMILING AT ME
JUST AS PLAIN AS I SEE YOU ALL IN THIS ROOM ALL THE WAY THEY WERE
AHEAD OF ME ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE HORSE UNTIL I PULLED UP AT THE
HOUSE IN THE BRIXTON ROAD
THERE WAS NOT A SOUL TO BE SEEN NOR A SOUND TO BE HEARD EXCEPT THE
DRIPPING OF THE RAIN WHEN I LOOKED IN AT THE WINDOW I FOUND DREBBER
ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER IN A DRUNKEN SLEEP I SHOOK HIM BY THE ARM
ITS TIME TO GET OUT I SAID
ALL RIGHT CABBY SAID HE
I SUPPOSE HE THOUGHT WE HAD COME TO THE HOTEL THAT HE HAD MENTIONED
FOR HE GOT OUT WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND FOLLOWED ME DOWN THE GARDEN
I HAD TO WALK BESIDE HIM TO KEEP HIM STEADY FOR HE WAS STILL A
LITTLE TOPHEAVY WHEN WE CAME TO THE DOOR I OPENED IT AND LED HIM
INTO THE FRONT ROOM I GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT ALL THE WAY THE FATHER
AND THE DAUGHTER WERE WALKING IN FRONT OF US
ITS INFERNALLY DARK SAID HE STAMPING ABOUT
WELL SOON HAVE A LIGHT I SAID STRIKING A MATCH AND PUTTING IT
TO A WAX CANDLE WHICH I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME NOW ENOCH DREBBER I
CONTINUED TURNING TO HIM AND HOLDING THE LIGHT TO MY OWN FACE WHO
AM I
HE GAZED AT ME WITH BLEARED DRUNKEN EYES FOR A MOMENT AND THEN I
SAW A HORROR SPRING UP IN THEM AND CONVULSE HIS WHOLE FEATURES
WHICH SHOWED ME THAT HE KNEW ME HE STAGGERED BACK WITH A LIVID FACE
AND I SAW THE PERSPIRATION BREAK OUT UPON HIS BROW WHILE HIS TEETH
CHATTERED IN HIS HEAD AT THE SIGHT I LEANED MY BACK AGAINST THE
DOOR AND LAUGHED LOUD AND LONG I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT VENGEANCE
WOULD BE SWEET BUT I HAD NEVER HOPED FOR THE CONTENTMENT OF SOUL
WHICH NOW POSSESSED ME
YOU DOG I SAID I HAVE HUNTED YOU FROM SALT LAKE CITY TO ST
PETERSBURG AND YOU HAVE ALWAYS ESCAPED ME NOW AT LAST YOUR
WANDERINGS HAVE COME TO AN END FOR EITHER YOU OR I SHALL NEVER SEE
TOMORROWS SUN RISE HE SHRUNK STILL FURTHER AWAY AS I SPOKE AND I
COULD SEE ON HIS FACE THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS MAD SO I WAS FOR THE
TIME THE PULSES IN MY TEMPLES BEAT LIKE SLEDGEHAMMERS AND I
BELIEVE I WOULD HAVE HAD A FIT OF SOME SORT IF THE BLOOD HAD NOT
GUSHED FROM MY NOSE AND RELIEVED ME
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF LUCY FERRIER NOW I CRIED LOCKING THE DOOR
AND SHAKING THE KEY IN HIS FACE PUNISHMENT HAS BEEN SLOW IN COMING
BUT IT HAS OVERTAKEN YOU AT LAST I SAW HIS COWARD LIPS TREMBLE AS I
SPOKE HE WOULD HAVE BEGGED FOR HIS LIFE BUT HE KNEW WELL THAT IT
WAS USELESS
WOULD YOU MURDER ME HE STAMMERED
THERE IS NO MURDER I ANSWERED WHO TALKS OF MURDERING A MAD DOG
WHAT MERCY HAD YOU UPON MY POOR DARLING WHEN YOU DRAGGED HER FROM
HER SLAUGHTERED FATHER AND BORE HER AWAY TO YOUR ACCURSED AND
SHAMELESS HAREM
IT WAS NOT I WHO KILLED HER FATHER HE CRIED
BUT IT WAS YOU WHO BROKE HER INNOCENT HEART I SHRIEKED THRUSTING
THE BOX BEFORE HIM LET THE HIGH GOD JUDGE BETWEEN US CHOOSE AND
EAT THERE IS DEATH IN ONE AND LIFE IN THE OTHER I SHALL TAKE WHAT
YOU LEAVE LET US SEE IF THERE IS JUSTICE UPON THE EARTH OR IF WE
ARE RULED BY CHANCE
HE COWERED AWAY WITH WILD CRIES AND PRAYERS FOR MERCY BUT I DREW MY
KNIFE AND HELD IT TO HIS THROAT UNTIL HE HAD OBEYED ME THEN I
SWALLOWED THE OTHER AND WE STOOD FACING ONE ANOTHER IN SILENCE FOR A
MINUTE OR MORE WAITING TO SEE WHICH WAS TO LIVE AND WHICH WAS TO
DIE SHALL I EVER FORGET THE LOOK WHICH CAME OVER HIS FACE WHEN THE
FIRST WARNING PANGS TOLD HIM THAT THE POISON WAS IN HIS SYSTEM I
LAUGHED AS I SAW IT AND HELD LUCYS MARRIAGE RING IN FRONT OF HIS
EYES IT WAS BUT FOR A MOMENT FOR THE ACTION OF THE ALKALOID IS
RAPID A SPASM OF PAIN CONTORTED HIS FEATURES HE THREW HIS HANDS OUT
IN FRONT OF HIM STAGGERED AND THEN WITH A HOARSE CRY FELL HEAVILY
UPON THE FLOOR I TURNED HIM OVER WITH MY FOOT AND PLACED MY HAND
UPON HIS HEART THERE WAS NO MOVEMENT HE WAS DEAD
THE BLOOD HAD BEEN STREAMING FROM MY NOSE BUT I HAD TAKEN NO NOTICE
OF IT I DONT KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT PUT IT INTO MY HEAD TO WRITE
UPON THE WALL WITH IT PERHAPS IT WAS SOME MISCHIEVOUS IDEA OF
SETTING THE POLICE UPON A WRONG TRACK FOR I FELT LIGHTHEARTED AND
CHEERFUL I REMEMBERED A GERMAN BEING FOUND IN NEW YORK WITH RACHE
WRITTEN UP ABOVE HIM AND IT WAS ARGUED AT THE TIME IN THE NEWSPAPERS
THAT THE SECRET SOCIETIES MUST HAVE DONE IT I GUESSED THAT WHAT
PUZZLED THE NEW YORKERS WOULD PUZZLE THE LONDONERS SO I DIPPED MY
FINGER IN MY OWN BLOOD AND PRINTED IT ON A CONVENIENT PLACE ON THE
WALL THEN I WALKED DOWN TO MY CAB AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS NOBODY
ABOUT AND THAT THE NIGHT WAS STILL VERY WILD I HAD DRIVEN SOME
DISTANCE WHEN I PUT MY HAND INTO THE POCKET IN WHICH I USUALLY KEPT
LUCYS RING AND FOUND THAT IT WAS NOT THERE I WAS THUNDERSTRUCK AT
THIS FOR IT WAS THE ONLY MEMENTO THAT I HAD OF HER THINKING THAT I
MIGHT HAVE DROPPED IT WHEN I STOOPED OVER DREBBERS BODY I DROVE
BACK AND LEAVING MY CAB IN A SIDE STREET I WENT BOLDLY UP TO THE
HOUSEFOR I WAS READY TO DARE ANYTHING RATHER THAN LOSE THE RING
WHEN I ARRIVED THERE I WALKED RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF A
POLICEOFFICER WHO WAS COMING OUT AND ONLY MANAGED TO DISARM HIS
SUSPICIONS BY PRETENDING TO BE HOPELESSLY DRUNK
THAT WAS HOW ENOCH DREBBER CAME TO HIS END ALL I HAD TO DO THEN WAS
TO DO AS MUCH FOR STANGERSON AND SO PAY OFF JOHN FERRIERS DEBT I
KNEW THAT HE WAS STAYING AT HALLIDAYS PRIVATE HOTEL AND I HUNG
ABOUT ALL DAY BUT HE NEVER CAME OUT I FANCY THAT HE SUSPECTED
SOMETHING WHEN DREBBER FAILED TO PUT IN AN APPEARANCE HE WAS
CUNNING WAS STANGERSON AND ALWAYS ON HIS GUARD IF HE THOUGHT HE
COULD KEEP ME OFF BY STAYING INDOORS HE WAS VERY MUCH MISTAKEN I
SOON FOUND OUT WHICH WAS THE WINDOW OF HIS BEDROOM AND EARLY NEXT
MORNING I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME LADDERS WHICH WERE LYING IN THE LANE
BEHIND THE HOTEL AND SO MADE MY WAY INTO HIS ROOM IN THE GREY OF THE
DAWN I WOKE HIM UP AND TOLD HIM THAT THE HOUR HAD COME WHEN HE WAS
TO ANSWER FOR THE LIFE HE HAD TAKEN SO LONG BEFORE I DESCRIBED
DREBBERS DEATH TO HIM AND I GAVE HIM THE SAME CHOICE OF THE
POISONED PILLS INSTEAD OF GRASPING AT THE CHANCE OF SAFETY WHICH
THAT OFFERED HIM HE SPRANG FROM HIS BED AND FLEW AT MY THROAT IN
SELFDEFENCE I STABBED HIM TO THE HEART IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME
IN ANY CASE FOR PROVIDENCE WOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED HIS GUILTY HAND
TO PICK OUT ANYTHING BUT THE POISON
I HAVE LITTLE MORE TO SAY AND ITS AS WELL FOR I AM ABOUT DONE UP
I WENT ON CABBING IT FOR A DAY OR SO INTENDING TO KEEP AT IT UNTIL I
COULD SAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE ME BACK TO AMERICA I WAS STANDING IN THE
YARD WHEN A RAGGED YOUNGSTER ASKED IF THERE WAS A CABBY THERE CALLED
JEFFERSON HOPE AND SAID THAT HIS CAB WAS WANTED BY A GENTLEMAN AT
B BAKER STREET I WENT ROUND SUSPECTING NO HARM AND THE NEXT
THING I KNEW THIS YOUNG MAN HERE HAD THE BRACELETS ON MY WRISTS AND
AS NEATLY SNACKLED AS EVER I SAW IN MY LIFE THATS THE WHOLE OF MY
STORY GENTLEMEN YOU MAY CONSIDER ME TO BE A MURDERER BUT I HOLD
THAT I AM JUST AS MUCH AN OFFICER OF JUSTICE AS YOU ARE
SO THRILLING HAD THE MANS NARRATIVE BEEN AND HIS MANNER WAS SO
IMPRESSIVE THAT WE HAD SAT SILENT AND ABSORBED EVEN THE PROFESSIONAL
DETECTIVES BLASE AS THEY WERE IN EVERY DETAIL OF CRIME APPEARED TO
BE KEENLY INTERESTED IN THE MANS STORY WHEN HE FINISHED WE SAT FOR
SOME MINUTES IN A STILLNESS WHICH WAS ONLY BROKEN BY THE SCRATCHING
OF LESTRADES PENCIL AS HE GAVE THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO HIS
SHORTHAND ACCOUNT
THERE IS ONLY ONE POINT ON WHICH I SHOULD LIKE A LITTLE MORE
INFORMATION SHERLOCK HOLMES SAID AT LAST WHO WAS YOUR ACCOMPLICE
WHO CAME FOR THE RING WHICH I ADVERTISED
THE PRISONER WINKED AT MY FRIEND JOCOSELY I CAN TELL MY OWN
SECRETS HE SAID BUT I DONT GET OTHER PEOPLE INTO TROUBLE I SAW
YOUR ADVERTISEMENT AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A PLANT OR IT MIGHT BE
THE RING WHICH I WANTED MY FRIEND VOLUNTEERED TO GO AND SEE I THINK
YOULL OWN HE DID IT SMARTLY
NOT A DOUBT OF THAT SAID HOLMES HEARTILY
NOW GENTLEMEN THE INSPECTOR REMARKED GRAVELY THE FORMS OF THE
LAW MUST BE COMPLIED WITH ON THURSDAY THE PRISONER WILL BE BROUGHT
BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES AND YOUR ATTENDANCE WILL BE REQUIRED UNTIL
THEN I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM HE RANG THE BELL AS HE SPOKE
AND JEFFERSON HOPE WAS LED OFF BY A COUPLE OF WARDERS WHILE MY
FRIEND AND I MADE OUR WAY OUT OF THE STATION AND TOOK A CAB BACK TO
BAKER STREET
CHAPTER VII
THE CONCLUSION
WE HAD ALL BEEN WARNED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES UPON THE
THURSDAY BUT WHEN THE THURSDAY CAME THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR OUR
TESTIMONY A HIGHER JUDGE HAD TAKEN THE MATTER IN HAND AND JEFFERSON
HOPE HAD BEEN SUMMONED BEFORE A TRIBUNAL WHERE STRICT JUSTICE WOULD
BE METED OUT TO HIM ON THE VERY NIGHT AFTER HIS CAPTURE THE ANEURISM
BURST AND HE WAS FOUND IN THE MORNING STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR OF
THE CELL WITH A PLACID SMILE UPON HIS FACE AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN
ABLE IN HIS DYING MOMENTS TO LOOK BACK UPON A USEFUL LIFE AND ON
WORK WELL DONE
GREGSON AND LESTRADE WILL BE WILD ABOUT HIS DEATH HOLMES REMARKED
AS WE CHATTED IT OVER NEXT EVENING WHERE WILL THEIR GRAND
ADVERTISEMENT BE NOW
I DONT SEE THAT THEY HAD VERY MUCH TO DO WITH HIS CAPTURE I
ANSWERED
WHAT YOU DO IN THIS WORLD IS A MATTER OF NO CONSEQUENCE RETURNED
MY COMPANION BITTERLY THE QUESTION IS WHAT CAN YOU MAKE PEOPLE
BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE DONE NEVER MIND HE CONTINUED MORE BRIGHTLY
AFTER A PAUSE I WOULD NOT HAVE MISSED THE INVESTIGATION FOR
ANYTHING THERE HAS BEEN NO BETTER CASE WITHIN MY RECOLLECTION
SIMPLE AS IT WAS THERE WERE SEVERAL MOST INSTRUCTIVE POINTS ABOUT
IT
SIMPLE I EJACULATED
WELL REALLY IT CAN HARDLY BE DESCRIBED AS OTHERWISE SAID
SHERLOCK HOLMES SMILING AT MY SURPRISE THE PROOF OF ITS INTRINSIC
SIMPLICITY IS THAT WITHOUT ANY HELP SAVE A FEW VERY ORDINARY
DEDUCTIONS I WAS ABLE TO LAY MY HAND UPON THE CRIMINAL WITHIN THREE
DAYS
THAT IS TRUE SAID I
I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED TO YOU THAT WHAT IS OUT OF THE COMMON IS
USUALLY A GUIDE RATHER THAN A HINDRANCE IN SOLVING A PROBLEM OF THIS
SORT THE GRAND THING IS TO BE ABLE TO REASON BACKWARDS THAT IS A
VERY USEFUL ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A VERY EASY ONE BUT PEOPLE DO NOT
PRACTISE IT MUCH IN THE EVERYDAY AFFAIRS OF LIFE IT IS MORE USEFUL
TO REASON FORWARDS AND SO THE OTHER COMES TO BE NEGLECTED THERE ARE
FIFTY WHO CAN REASON SYNTHETICALLY FOR ONE WHO CAN REASON
ANALYTICALLY
I CONFESS SAID I THAT I DO NOT QUITE FOLLOW YOU
I HARDLY EXPECTED THAT YOU WOULD LET ME SEE IF I CAN MAKE IT
CLEARER MOST PEOPLE IF YOU DESCRIBE A TRAIN OF EVENTS TO THEM WILL
TELL YOU WHAT THE RESULT WOULD BE THEY CAN PUT THOSE EVENTS TOGETHER
IN THEIR MINDS AND ARGUE FROM THEM THAT SOMETHING WILL COME TO PASS
THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE HOWEVER WHO IF YOU TOLD THEM A RESULT WOULD
BE ABLE TO EVOLVE FROM THEIR OWN INNER CONSCIOUSNESS WHAT THE STEPS
WERE WHICH LED UP TO THAT RESULT THIS POWER IS WHAT I MEAN WHEN I
TALK OF REASONING BACKWARDS OR ANALYTICALLY
I UNDERSTAND SAID I
NOW THIS WAS A CASE IN WHICH YOU WERE GIVEN THE RESULT AND HAD TO
FIND EVERYTHING ELSE FOR YOURSELF NOW LET ME ENDEAVOUR TO SHOW YOU
THE DIFFERENT STEPS IN MY REASONING TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING I
APPROACHED THE HOUSE AS YOU KNOW ON FOOT AND WITH MY MIND ENTIRELY
FREE FROM ALL IMPRESSIONS I NATURALLY BEGAN BY EXAMINING THE
ROADWAY AND THERE AS I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED TO YOU I SAW CLEARLY
THE MARKS OF A CAB WHICH I ASCERTAINED BY INQUIRY MUST HAVE BEEN
THERE DURING THE NIGHT I SATISFIED MYSELF THAT IT WAS A CAB AND NOT
A PRIVATE CARRIAGE BY THE NARROW GAUGE OF THE WHEELS THE ORDINARY
LONDON GROWLER IS CONSIDERABLY LESS WIDE THAN A GENTLEMANS BROUGHAM
THIS WAS THE FIRST POINT GAINED I THEN WALKED SLOWLY DOWN THE
GARDEN PATH WHICH HAPPENED TO BE COMPOSED OF A CLAY SOIL PECULIARLY
SUITABLE FOR TAKING IMPRESSIONS NO DOUBT IT APPEARED TO YOU TO BE A
MERE TRAMPLED LINE OF SLUSH BUT TO MY TRAINED EYES EVERY MARK UPON
ITS SURFACE HAD A MEANING THERE IS NO BRANCH OF DETECTIVE SCIENCE
WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT AND SO MUCH NEGLECTED AS THE ART OF TRACING
FOOTSTEPS HAPPILY I HAVE ALWAYS LAID GREAT STRESS UPON IT AND MUCH
PRACTICE HAS MADE IT SECOND NATURE TO ME I SAW THE HEAVY FOOTMARKS
OF THE CONSTABLES BUT I SAW ALSO THE TRACK OF THE TWO MEN WHO HAD
FIRST PASSED THROUGH THE GARDEN IT WAS EASY TO TELL THAT THEY HAD
BEEN BEFORE THE OTHERS BECAUSE IN PLACES THEIR MARKS HAD BEEN
ENTIRELY OBLITERATED BY THE OTHERS COMING UPON THE TOP OF THEM IN
THIS WAY MY SECOND LINK WAS FORMED WHICH TOLD ME THAT THE NOCTURNAL
VISITORS WERE TWO IN NUMBER ONE REMARKABLE FOR HIS HEIGHT AS I
CALCULATED FROM THE LENGTH OF HIS STRIDE AND THE OTHER FASHIONABLY
DRESSED TO JUDGE FROM THE SMALL AND ELEGANT IMPRESSION LEFT BY HIS
BOOTS
ON ENTERING THE HOUSE THIS LAST INFERENCE WAS CONFIRMED MY
WELLBOOTED MAN LAY BEFORE ME THE TALL ONE THEN HAD DONE THE
MURDER IF MURDER THERE WAS THERE WAS NO WOUND UPON THE DEAD MANS
PERSON BUT THE AGITATED EXPRESSION UPON HIS FACE ASSURED ME THAT HE
HAD FORESEEN HIS FATE BEFORE IT CAME UPON HIM MEN WHO DIE FROM HEART
DISEASE OR ANY SUDDEN NATURAL CAUSE NEVER BY ANY CHANCE EXHIBIT
AGITATION UPON THEIR FEATURES HAVING SNIFFED THE DEAD MANS LIPS I
DETECTED A SLIGHTLY SOUR SMELL AND I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE
HAD HAD POISON FORCED UPON HIM AGAIN I ARGUED THAT IT HAD BEEN
FORCED UPON HIM FROM THE HATRED AND FEAR EXPRESSED UPON HIS FACE BY
THE METHOD OF EXCLUSION I HAD ARRIVED AT THIS RESULT FOR NO OTHER
HYPOTHESIS WOULD MEET THE FACTS DO NOT IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A VERY
UNHEARD OF IDEA THE FORCIBLE ADMINISTRATION OF POISON IS BY NO MEANS
A NEW THING IN CRIMINAL ANNALS THE CASES OF DOLSKY IN ODESSA AND OF
LETURIER IN MONTPELLIER WILL OCCUR AT ONCE TO ANY TOXICOLOGIST
AND NOW CAME THE GREAT QUESTION AS TO THE REASON WHY ROBBERY HAD
NOT BEEN THE OBJECT OF THE MURDER FOR NOTHING WAS TAKEN WAS IT
POLITICS THEN OR WAS IT A WOMAN THAT WAS THE QUESTION WHICH
CONFRONTED ME I WAS INCLINED FROM THE FIRST TO THE LATTER
SUPPOSITION POLITICAL ASSASSINS ARE ONLY TOO GLAD TO DO THEIR WORK
AND TO FLY THIS MURDER HAD ON THE CONTRARY BEEN DONE MOST
DELIBERATELY AND THE PERPETRATOR HAD LEFT HIS TRACKS ALL OVER THE
ROOM SHOWING THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE ALL THE TIME IT MUST HAVE BEEN
A PRIVATE WRONG AND NOT A POLITICAL ONE WHICH CALLED FOR SUCH A
METHODICAL REVENGE WHEN THE INSCRIPTION WAS DISCOVERED UPON THE WALL
I WAS MORE INCLINED THAN EVER TO MY OPINION THE THING WAS TOO
EVIDENTLY A BLIND WHEN THE RING WAS FOUND HOWEVER IT SETTLED THE
QUESTION CLEARLY THE MURDERER HAD USED IT TO REMIND HIS VICTIM OF
SOME DEAD OR ABSENT WOMAN IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT I ASKED GREGSON
WHETHER HE HAD ENQUIRED IN HIS TELEGRAM TO CLEVELAND AS TO ANY
PARTICULAR POINT IN MR DREBBERS FORMER CAREER HE ANSWERED YOU
REMEMBER IN THE NEGATIVE
I THEN PROCEEDED TO MAKE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM WHICH
CONFIRMED ME IN MY OPINION AS TO THE MURDERERS HEIGHT AND FURNISHED
ME WITH THE ADDITIONAL DETAILS AS TO THE TRICHINOPOLY CIGAR AND THE
LENGTH OF HIS NAILS I HAD ALREADY COME TO THE CONCLUSION SINCE
THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE THAT THE BLOOD WHICH COVERED THE
FLOOR HAD BURST FROM THE MURDERERS NOSE IN HIS EXCITEMENT I COULD
PERCEIVE THAT THE TRACK OF BLOOD COINCIDED WITH THE TRACK OF HIS
FEET IT IS SELDOM THAT ANY MAN UNLESS HE IS VERY FULLBLOODED
BREAKS OUT IN THIS WAY THROUGH EMOTION SO I HAZARDED THE OPINION
THAT THE CRIMINAL WAS PROBABLY A ROBUST AND RUDDYFACED MAN EVENTS
PROVED THAT I HAD JUDGED CORRECTLY
HAVING LEFT THE HOUSE I PROCEEDED TO DO WHAT GREGSON HAD NEGLECTED
I TELEGRAPHED TO THE HEAD OF THE POLICE AT CLEVELAND LIMITING MY
ENQUIRY TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE MARRIAGE OF ENOCH
DREBBER THE ANSWER WAS CONCLUSIVE IT TOLD ME THAT DREBBER HAD
ALREADY APPLIED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE LAW AGAINST AN OLD RIVAL IN
LOVE NAMED JEFFERSON HOPE AND THAT THIS SAME HOPE WAS AT PRESENT IN
EUROPE I KNEW NOW THAT I HELD THE CLUE TO THE MYSTERY IN MY HAND
AND ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO SECURE THE MURDERER
I HAD ALREADY DETERMINED IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE MAN WHO HAD WALKED
INTO THE HOUSE WITH DREBBER WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE MAN WHO HAD
DRIVEN THE CAB THE MARKS IN THE ROAD SHOWED ME THAT THE HORSE HAD
WANDERED ON IN A WAY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE HAD THERE BEEN
ANYONE IN CHARGE OF IT WHERE THEN COULD THE DRIVER BE UNLESS HE
WERE INSIDE THE HOUSE AGAIN IT IS ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THAT ANY SANE
MAN WOULD CARRY OUT A DELIBERATE CRIME UNDER THE VERY EYES AS IT
WERE OF A THIRD PERSON WHO WAS SURE TO BETRAY HIM LASTLY
SUPPOSING ONE MAN WISHED TO DOG ANOTHER THROUGH LONDON WHAT BETTER
MEANS COULD HE ADOPT THAN TO TURN CABDRIVER ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS
LED ME TO THE IRRESISTIBLE CONCLUSION THAT JEFFERSON HOPE WAS TO BE
FOUND AMONG THE JARVEYS OF THE METROPOLIS
IF HE HAD BEEN ONE THERE WAS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAD CEASED
TO BE ON THE CONTRARY FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW ANY SUDDEN CHANCE
WOULD BE LIKELY TO DRAW ATTENTION TO HIMSELF HE WOULD PROBABLY FOR
A TIME AT LEAST CONTINUE TO PERFORM HIS DUTIES THERE WAS NO REASON
TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS GOING UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME WHY SHOULD HE
CHANGE HIS NAME IN A COUNTRY WHERE NO ONE KNEW HIS ORIGINAL ONE I
THEREFORE ORGANIZED MY STREET ARAB DETECTIVE CORPS AND SENT THEM
SYSTEMATICALLY TO EVERY CAB PROPRIETOR IN LONDON UNTIL THEY FERRETED
OUT THE MAN THAT I WANTED HOW WELL THEY SUCCEEDED AND HOW QUICKLY I
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT ARE STILL FRESH IN YOUR RECOLLECTION THE
MURDER OF STANGERSON WAS AN INCIDENT WHICH WAS ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED
BUT WHICH COULD HARDLY IN ANY CASE HAVE BEEN PREVENTED THROUGH IT
AS YOU KNOW I CAME INTO POSSESSION OF THE PILLS THE EXISTENCE OF
WHICH I HAD ALREADY SURMISED YOU SEE THE WHOLE THING IS A CHAIN OF
LOGICAL SEQUENCES WITHOUT A BREAK OR FLAW
IT IS WONDERFUL I CRIED YOUR MERITS SHOULD BE PUBLICLY
RECOGNIZED YOU SHOULD PUBLISH AN ACCOUNT OF THE CASE IF YOU WONT
I WILL FOR YOU
YOU MAY DO WHAT YOU LIKE DOCTOR HE ANSWERED SEE HERE HE
CONTINUED HANDING A PAPER OVER TO ME LOOK AT THIS
IT WAS THE ECHO FOR THE DAY AND THE PARAGRAPH TO WHICH HE POINTED
WAS DEVOTED TO THE CASE IN QUESTION
THE PUBLIC IT SAID HAVE LOST A SENSATIONAL TREAT THROUGH THE
SUDDEN DEATH OF THE MAN HOPE WHO WAS SUSPECTED OF THE MURDER OF MR
ENOCH DREBBER AND OF MR JOSEPH STANGERSON THE DETAILS OF THE CASE
WILL PROBABLY BE NEVER KNOWN NOW THOUGH WE ARE INFORMED UPON GOOD
AUTHORITY THAT THE CRIME WAS THE RESULT OF AN OLD STANDING AND
ROMANTIC FEUD IN WHICH LOVE AND MORMONISM BORE A PART IT SEEMS THAT
BOTH THE VICTIMS BELONGED IN THEIR YOUNGER DAYS TO THE LATTER DAY
SAINTS AND HOPE THE DECEASED PRISONER HAILS ALSO FROM SALT LAKE
CITY IF THE CASE HAS HAD NO OTHER EFFECT IT AT LEAST BRINGS OUT
IN THE MOST STRIKING MANNER THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR DETECTIVE POLICE
FORCE AND WILL SERVE AS A LESSON TO ALL FOREIGNERS THAT THEY WILL DO
WISELY TO SETTLE THEIR FEUDS AT HOME AND NOT TO CARRY THEM ON TO
BRITISH SOIL IT IS AN OPEN SECRET THAT THE CREDIT OF THIS SMART
CAPTURE BELONGS ENTIRELY TO THE WELLKNOWN SCOTLAND YARD OFFICIALS
MESSRS LESTRADE AND GREGSON THE MAN WAS APPREHENDED IT APPEARS IN
THE ROOMS OF A CERTAIN MR SHERLOCK HOLMES WHO HAS HIMSELF AS AN
AMATEUR SHOWN SOME TALENT IN THE DETECTIVE LINE AND WHO WITH SUCH
INSTRUCTORS MAY HOPE IN TIME TO ATTAIN TO SOME DEGREE OF THEIR
SKILL IT IS EXPECTED THAT A TESTIMONIAL OF SOME SORT WILL BE
PRESENTED TO THE TWO OFFICERS AS A FITTING RECOGNITION OF THEIR
SERVICES
DIDNT I TELL YOU SO WHEN WE STARTED CRIED SHERLOCK HOLMES WITH A
LAUGH THATS THE RESULT OF ALL OUR STUDY IN SCARLET TO GET THEM A
TESTIMONIAL
NEVER MIND I ANSWERED I HAVE ALL THE FACTS IN MY JOURNAL AND
THE PUBLIC SHALL KNOW THEM IN THE MEANTIME YOU MUST MAKE YOURSELF

CHAPTER I
THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION
SHERLOCK HOLMES TOOK HIS BOTTLE FROM THE CORNER OF THE MANTELPIECE
AND HIS HYPODERMIC SYRINGE FROM ITS NEAT MOROCCO CASE WITH HIS LONG
WHITE NERVOUS FINGERS HE ADJUSTED THE DELICATE NEEDLE AND ROLLED
BACK HIS LEFT SHIRTCUFF FOR SOME LITTLE TIME HIS EYES RESTED
THOUGHTFULLY UPON THE SINEWY FOREARM AND WRIST ALL DOTTED AND SCARRED
WITH INNUMERABLE PUNCTUREMARKS FINALLY HE THRUST THE SHARP POINT
HOME PRESSED DOWN THE TINY PISTON AND SANK BACK INTO THE
VELVETLINED ARMCHAIR WITH A LONG SIGH OF SATISFACTION
THREE TIMES A DAY FOR MANY MONTHS I HAD WITNESSED THIS PERFORMANCE
BUT CUSTOM HAD NOT RECONCILED MY MIND TO IT ON THE CONTRARY FROM
DAY TO DAY I HAD BECOME MORE IRRITABLE AT THE SIGHT AND MY
CONSCIENCE SWELLED NIGHTLY WITHIN ME AT THE THOUGHT THAT I HAD LACKED
THE COURAGE TO PROTEST AGAIN AND AGAIN I HAD REGISTERED A VOW THAT I
SHOULD DELIVER MY SOUL UPON THE SUBJECT BUT THERE WAS THAT IN THE
COOL NONCHALANT AIR OF MY COMPANION WHICH MADE HIM THE LAST MAN WITH
WHOM ONE WOULD CARE TO TAKE ANYTHING APPROACHING TO A LIBERTY HIS
GREAT POWERS HIS MASTERLY MANNER AND THE EXPERIENCE WHICH I HAD HAD
OF HIS MANY EXTRAORDINARY QUALITIES ALL MADE ME DIFFIDENT AND
BACKWARD IN CROSSING HIM
YET UPON THAT AFTERNOON WHETHER IT WAS THE BEAUNE WHICH I HAD TAKEN
WITH MY LUNCH OR THE ADDITIONAL EXASPERATION PRODUCED BY THE EXTREME
DELIBERATION OF HIS MANNER I SUDDENLY FELT THAT I COULD HOLD OUT NO
LONGER
WHICH IS IT TODAY I ASKEDMORPHINE OR COCAINE
HE RAISED HIS EYES LANGUIDLY FROM THE OLD BLACKLETTER VOLUME WHICH
HE HAD OPENED IT IS COCAINE HE SAIDA SEVENPERCENT SOLUTION
WOULD YOU CARE TO TRY IT
NO INDEED I ANSWERED BRUSQUELY MY CONSTITUTION HAS NOT GOT
OVER THE AFGHAN CAMPAIGN YET I CANNOT AFFORD TO THROW ANY EXTRA
STRAIN UPON IT
HE SMILED AT MY VEHEMENCE PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT WATSON HE SAID
I SUPPOSE THAT ITS INFLUENCE IS PHYSICALLY A BAD ONE I FIND IT
HOWEVER SO TRANSCENDENTLY STIMULATING AND CLARIFYING TO THE MIND
THAT ITS SECONDARY ACTION IS A MATTER OF SMALL MOMENT
BUT CONSIDER I SAID EARNESTLY COUNT THE COST YOUR BRAIN MAY
AS YOU SAY BE ROUSED AND EXCITED BUT IT IS A PATHOLOGICAL AND
MORBID PROCESS WHICH INVOLVES INCREASED TISSUECHANGE AND MAY AT
LAST LEAVE A PERMANENT WEAKNESS YOU KNOW TOO WHAT A BLACK REACTION
COMES UPON YOU SURELY THE GAME IS HARDLY WORTH THE CANDLE WHY
SHOULD YOU FOR A MERE PASSING PLEASURE RISK THE LOSS OF THOSE GREAT
POWERS WITH WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN ENDOWED REMEMBER THAT I SPEAK NOT
ONLY AS ONE COMRADE TO ANOTHER BUT AS A MEDICAL MAN TO ONE FOR WHOSE
CONSTITUTION HE IS TO SOME EXTENT ANSWERABLE
HE DID NOT SEEM OFFENDED ON THE CONTRARY HE PUT HIS FINGERTIPS
TOGETHER AND LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE ARMS OF HIS CHAIR LIKE ONE WHO
HAS A RELISH FOR CONVERSATION
MY MIND HE SAID REBELS AT STAGNATION GIVE ME PROBLEMS GIVE ME
WORK GIVE ME THE MOST ABSTRUSE CRYPTOGRAM OR THE MOST INTRICATE
ANALYSIS AND I AM IN MY OWN PROPER ATMOSPHERE I CAN DISPENSE THEN
WITH ARTIFICIAL STIMULANTS BUT I ABHOR THE DULL ROUTINE OF
EXISTENCE I CRAVE FOR MENTAL EXALTATION THAT IS WHY I HAVE CHOSEN
MY OWN PARTICULAR PROFESSIONOR RATHER CREATED IT FOR I AM THE
ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD
THE ONLY UNOFFICIAL DETECTIVE I SAID RAISING MY EYEBROWS
THE ONLY UNOFFICIAL CONSULTING DETECTIVE HE ANSWERED I AM THE
LAST AND HIGHEST COURT OF APPEAL IN DETECTION WHEN GREGSON OR
LESTRADE OR ATHELNEY JONES ARE OUT OF THEIR DEPTHSWHICH BY THE
WAY IS THEIR NORMAL STATETHE MATTER IS LAID BEFORE ME I EXAMINE
THE DATA AS AN EXPERT AND PRONOUNCE A SPECIALISTS OPINION I CLAIM
NO CREDIT IN SUCH CASES MY NAME FIGURES IN NO NEWSPAPER THE WORK
ITSELF THE PLEASURE OF FINDING A FIELD FOR MY PECULIAR POWERS IS MY
HIGHEST REWARD BUT YOU HAVE YOURSELF HAD SOME EXPERIENCE OF MY
METHODS OF WORK IN THE JEFFERSON HOPE CASE
YES INDEED SAID I CORDIALLY I WAS NEVER SO STRUCK BY ANYTHING
IN MY LIFE I EVEN EMBODIED IT IN A SMALL BROCHURE WITH THE SOMEWHAT
FANTASTIC TITLE OF A STUDY IN SCARLET
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY I GLANCED OVER IT SAID HE HONESTLY I
CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU UPON IT DETECTION IS OR OUGHT TO BE AN
EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL
MANNER YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT WITH ROMANTICISM WHICH
PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVESTORY OR AN
ELOPEMENT INTO THE FIFTH PROPOSITION OF EUCLID
BUT THE ROMANCE WAS THERE I REMONSTRATED I COULD NOT TAMPER WITH
THE FACTS
SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED OR AT LEAST A JUST SENSE OF
PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM THE ONLY POINT IN THE
CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM
EFFECTS TO CAUSES BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELING IT
I WAS ANNOYED AT THIS CRITICISM OF A WORK WHICH HAD BEEN SPECIALLY
DESIGNED TO PLEASE HIM I CONFESS TOO THAT I WAS IRRITATED BY THE
EGOTISM WHICH SEEMED TO DEMAND THAT EVERY LINE OF MY PAMPHLET SHOULD
BE DEVOTED TO HIS OWN SPECIAL DOINGS MORE THAN ONCE DURING THE YEARS
THAT I HAD LIVED WITH HIM IN BAKER STREET I HAD OBSERVED THAT A SMALL
VANITY UNDERLAY MY COMPANIONS QUIET AND DIDACTIC MANNER I MADE NO
REMARK HOWEVER BUT SAT NURSING MY WOUNDED LEG I HAD A JEZAIL
BULLET THROUGH IT SOME TIME BEFORE AND THOUGH IT DID NOT PREVENT ME
FROM WALKING IT ACHED WEARILY AT EVERY CHANGE OF THE WEATHER
MY PRACTICE HAS EXTENDED RECENTLY TO THE CONTINENT SAID HOLMES
AFTER A WHILE FILLING UP HIS OLD BRIERROOT PIPE I WAS CONSULTED
LAST WEEK BY FRANCOIS LE VILLARD WHO AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW HAS COME
RATHER TO THE FRONT LATELY IN THE FRENCH DETECTIVE SERVICE HE HAS
ALL THE CELTIC POWER OF QUICK INTUITION BUT HE IS DEFICIENT IN THE
WIDE RANGE OF EXACT KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO THE HIGHER
DEVELOPMENTS OF HIS ART THE CASE WAS CONCERNED WITH A WILL AND
POSSESSED SOME FEATURES OF INTEREST I WAS ABLE TO REFER HIM TO TWO
PARALLEL CASES THE ONE AT RIGA IN AND THE OTHER AT ST LOUIS
IN WHICH HAVE SUGGESTED TO HIM THE TRUE SOLUTION HERE IS THE
LETTER WHICH I HAD THIS MORNING ACKNOWLEDGING MY ASSISTANCE HE
TOSSED OVER AS HE SPOKE A CRUMPLED SHEET OF FOREIGN NOTEPAPER I
GLANCED MY EYES DOWN IT CATCHING A PROFUSION OF NOTES OF ADMIRATION
WITH STRAY MAGNIFIQUES COUPDEMATRES AND TOURSDEFORCE ALL
TESTIFYING TO THE ARDENT ADMIRATION OF THE FRENCHMAN
HE SPEAKS AS A PUPIL TO HIS MASTER SAID I
OH HE RATES MY ASSISTANCE TOO HIGHLY SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
LIGHTLY HE HAS CONSIDERABLE GIFTS HIMSELF HE POSSESSES TWO OUT OF
THE THREE QUALITIES NECESSARY FOR THE IDEAL DETECTIVE HE HAS THE
POWER OF OBSERVATION AND THAT OF DEDUCTION HE IS ONLY WANTING IN
KNOWLEDGE AND THAT MAY COME IN TIME HE IS NOW TRANSLATING MY SMALL
WORKS INTO FRENCH
YOUR WORKS
OH DIDNT YOU KNOW HE CRIED LAUGHING YES I HAVE BEEN GUILTY
OF SEVERAL MONOGRAPHS THEY ARE ALL UPON TECHNICAL SUBJECTS HERE
FOR EXAMPLE IS ONE UPON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE ASHES OF THE
VARIOUS TOBACCOES IN IT I ENUMERATE A HUNDRED AND FORTY FORMS OF
CIGAR CIGARETTE AND PIPETOBACCO WITH COLORED PLATES
ILLUSTRATING THE DIFFERENCE IN THE ASH IT IS A POINT WHICH IS
CONTINUALLY TURNING UP IN CRIMINAL TRIALS AND WHICH IS SOMETIMES OF
SUPREME IMPORTANCE AS A CLUE IF YOU CAN SAY DEFINITELY FOR EXAMPLE
THAT SOME MURDER HAS BEEN DONE BY A MAN WHO WAS SMOKING AN INDIAN
LUNKAH IT OBVIOUSLY NARROWS YOUR FIELD OF SEARCH TO THE TRAINED EYE
THERE IS AS MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BLACK ASH OF A TRICHINOPOLY
AND THE WHITE FLUFF OF BIRDSEYE AS THERE IS BETWEEN A CABBAGE AND A
POTATO
YOU HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY GENIUS FOR MINUTIAE I REMARKED
I APPRECIATE THEIR IMPORTANCE HERE IS MY MONOGRAPH UPON THE TRACING
OF FOOTSTEPS WITH SOME REMARKS UPON THE USES OF PLASTER OF PARIS AS
A PRESERVER OF IMPRESSES HERE TOO IS A CURIOUS LITTLE WORK UPON
THE INFLUENCE OF A TRADE UPON THE FORM OF THE HAND WITH LITHOTYPES
OF THE HANDS OF SLATERS SAILORS CORKCUTTERS COMPOSITORS WEAVERS
AND DIAMONDPOLISHERS THAT IS A MATTER OF GREAT PRACTICAL INTEREST
TO THE SCIENTIFIC DETECTIVEESPECIALLY IN CASES OF UNCLAIMED
BODIES OR IN DISCOVERING THE ANTECEDENTS OF CRIMINALS BUT I WEARY
YOU WITH MY HOBBY
NOT AT ALL I ANSWERED EARNESTLY IT IS OF THE GREATEST INTEREST
TO ME ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING YOUR
PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF IT BUT YOU SPOKE JUST NOW OF OBSERVATION
AND DEDUCTION SURELY THE ONE TO SOME EXTENT IMPLIES THE OTHER
WHY HARDLY HE ANSWERED LEANING BACK LUXURIOUSLY IN HIS ARMCHAIR
AND SENDING UP THICK BLUE WREATHS FROM HIS PIPE FOR EXAMPLE
OBSERVATION SHOWS ME THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE WIGMORE STREET
POSTOFFICE THIS MORNING BUT DEDUCTION LETS ME KNOW THAT WHEN THERE
YOU DISPATCHED A TELEGRAM
RIGHT SAID I RIGHT ON BOTH POINTS BUT I CONFESS THAT I DONT
SEE HOW YOU ARRIVED AT IT IT WAS A SUDDEN IMPULSE UPON MY PART AND
I HAVE MENTIONED IT TO NO ONE
IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF HE REMARKED CHUCKLING AT MY
SURPRISESO ABSURDLY SIMPLE THAT AN EXPLANATION IS SUPERFLUOUS
AND YET IT MAY SERVE TO DEFINE THE LIMITS OF OBSERVATION AND OF
DEDUCTION OBSERVATION TELLS ME THAT YOU HAVE A LITTLE REDDISH MOULD
ADHERING TO YOUR INSTEP JUST OPPOSITE THE SEYMOUR STREET OFFICE THEY
HAVE TAKEN UP THE PAVEMENT AND THROWN UP SOME EARTH WHICH LIES IN
SUCH A WAY THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO AVOID TREADING IN IT IN ENTERING
THE EARTH IS OF THIS PECULIAR REDDISH TINT WHICH IS FOUND AS FAR AS
I KNOW NOWHERE ELSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO MUCH IS OBSERVATION THE
REST IS DEDUCTION
HOW THEN DID YOU DEDUCE THE TELEGRAM
WHY OF COURSE I KNEW THAT YOU HAD NOT WRITTEN A LETTER SINCE I SAT
OPPOSITE TO YOU ALL MORNING I SEE ALSO IN YOUR OPEN DESK THERE THAT
YOU HAVE A SHEET OF STAMPS AND A THICK BUNDLE OF POSTCARDS WHAT
COULD YOU GO INTO THE POSTOFFICE FOR THEN BUT TO SEND A WIRE
ELIMINATE ALL OTHER FACTORS AND THE ONE WHICH REMAINS MUST BE THE
TRUTH
IN THIS CASE IT CERTAINLY IS SO I REPLIED AFTER A LITTLE THOUGHT
THE THING HOWEVER IS AS YOU SAY OF THE SIMPLEST WOULD YOU
THINK ME IMPERTINENT IF I WERE TO PUT YOUR THEORIES TO A MORE SEVERE
TEST
ON THE CONTRARY HE ANSWERED IT WOULD PREVENT ME FROM TAKING A
SECOND DOSE OF COCAINE I SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO LOOK INTO ANY
PROBLEM WHICH YOU MIGHT SUBMIT TO ME
I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A MAN TO HAVE ANY
OBJECT IN DAILY USE WITHOUT LEAVING THE IMPRESS OF HIS INDIVIDUALITY
UPON IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT A TRAINED OBSERVER MIGHT READ IT NOW I
HAVE HERE A WATCH WHICH HAS RECENTLY COME INTO MY POSSESSION WOULD
YOU HAVE THE KINDNESS TO LET ME HAVE AN OPINION UPON THE CHARACTER OR
HABITS OF THE LATE OWNER
I HANDED HIM OVER THE WATCH WITH SOME SLIGHT FEELING OF AMUSEMENT IN
MY HEART FOR THE TEST WAS AS I THOUGHT AN IMPOSSIBLE ONE AND I
INTENDED IT AS A LESSON AGAINST THE SOMEWHAT DOGMATIC TONE WHICH HE
OCCASIONALLY ASSUMED HE BALANCED THE WATCH IN HIS HAND GAZED HARD
AT THE DIAL OPENED THE BACK AND EXAMINED THE WORKS FIRST WITH HIS
NAKED EYES AND THEN WITH A POWERFUL CONVEX LENS I COULD HARDLY KEEP
FROM SMILING AT HIS CRESTFALLEN FACE WHEN HE FINALLY SNAPPED THE CASE
TO AND HANDED IT BACK
THERE ARE HARDLY ANY DATA HE REMARKED THE WATCH HAS BEEN
RECENTLY CLEANED WHICH ROBS ME OF MY MOST SUGGESTIVE FACTS
YOU ARE RIGHT I ANSWERED IT WAS CLEANED BEFORE BEING SENT TO
ME IN MY HEART I ACCUSED MY COMPANION OF PUTTING FORWARD A MOST
LAME AND IMPOTENT EXCUSE TO COVER HIS FAILURE WHAT DATA COULD HE
EXPECT FROM AN UNCLEANED WATCH
THOUGH UNSATISFACTORY MY RESEARCH HAS NOT BEEN ENTIRELY BARREN HE
OBSERVED STARING UP AT THE CEILING WITH DREAMY LACKLUSTRE EYES
SUBJECT TO YOUR CORRECTION I SHOULD JUDGE THAT THE WATCH BELONGED
TO YOUR ELDER BROTHER WHO INHERITED IT FROM YOUR FATHER
THAT YOU GATHER NO DOUBT FROM THE H W UPON THE BACK
QUITE SO THE W SUGGESTS YOUR OWN NAME THE DATE OF THE WATCH IS
NEARLY FIFTY YEARS BACK AND THE INITIALS ARE AS OLD AS THE WATCH SO
IT WAS MADE FOR THE LAST GENERATION JEWELRY USUALLY DESCENTS TO THE
ELDEST SON AND HE IS MOST LIKELY TO HAVE THE SAME NAME AS THE
FATHER YOUR FATHER HAS IF I REMEMBER RIGHT BEEN DEAD MANY YEARS
IT HAS THEREFORE BEEN IN THE HANDS OF YOUR ELDEST BROTHER
RIGHT SO FAR SAID I ANYTHING ELSE
HE WAS A MAN OF UNTIDY HABITSVERY UNTIDY AND CARELESS HE WAS
LEFT WITH GOOD PROSPECTS BUT HE THREW AWAY HIS CHANCES LIVED FOR
SOME TIME IN POVERTY WITH OCCASIONAL SHORT INTERVALS OF PROSPERITY
AND FINALLY TAKING TO DRINK HE DIED THAT IS ALL I CAN GATHER
I SPRANG FROM MY CHAIR AND LIMPED IMPATIENTLY ABOUT THE ROOM WITH
CONSIDERABLE BITTERNESS IN MY HEART
THIS IS UNWORTHY OF YOU HOLMES I SAID I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE DESCENDED TO THIS YOU HAVE MADE INQUIRES INTO
THE HISTORY OF MY UNHAPPY BROTHER AND YOU NOW PRETEND TO DEDUCE THIS
KNOWLEDGE IN SOME FANCIFUL WAY YOU CANNOT EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT
YOU HAVE READ ALL THIS FROM HIS OLD WATCH IT IS UNKIND AND TO
SPEAK PLAINLY HAS A TOUCH OF CHARLATANISM IN IT
MY DEAR DOCTOR SAID HE KINDLY PRAY ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES VIEWING THE
MATTER AS AN ABSTRACT PROBLEM I HAD FORGOTTEN HOW
PERSONAL AND PAINFUL A THING IT MIGHT BE TO YOU I ASSURE YOU
HOWEVER THAT I NEVER EVEN KNEW THAT YOU HAD A BROTHER UNTIL YOU
HANDED ME THE WATCH
THEN HOW IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS WONDERFUL DID YOU GET THESE
FACTS THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IN EVERY PARTICULAR
AH THAT IS GOOD LUCK I COULD ONLY SAY WHAT WAS THE BALANCE OF
PROBABILITY I DID NOT AT ALL EXPECT TO BE SO ACCURATE
BUT IT WAS NOT MERE GUESSWORK
NO NO I NEVER GUESS IT IS A SHOCKING HABITDESTRUCTIVE TO THE
LOGICAL FACULTY WHAT SEEMS STRANGE TO YOU IS ONLY SO BECAUSE YOU DO
NOT FOLLOW MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT OR OBSERVE THE SMALL FACTS UPON WHICH
LARGE INFERENCES MAY DEPEND FOR EXAMPLE I BEGAN BY STATING THAT
YOUR BROTHER WAS CARELESS WHEN YOU OBSERVE THE LOWER PART OF THAT
WATCHCASE YOU NOTICE THAT IT IS NOT ONLY DINTED IN TWO PLACES BUT
IT IS CUT AND MARKED ALL OVER FROM THE HABIT OF KEEPING OTHER HARD
OBJECTS SUCH AS COINS OR KEYS IN THE SAME POCKET SURELY IT IS NO
GREAT FEAT TO ASSUME THAT A MAN WHO TREATS A FIFTYGUINEA WATCH SO
CAVALIERLY MUST BE A CARELESS MAN NEITHER IS IT A VERY FARFETCHED
INFERENCE THAT A MAN WHO INHERITS ONE ARTICLE OF SUCH VALUE IS PRETTY
WELL PROVIDED FOR IN OTHER RESPECTS
I NODDED TO SHOW THAT I FOLLOWED HIS REASONING
IT IS VERY CUSTOMARY FOR PAWNBROKERS IN ENGLAND WHEN THEY TAKE A
WATCH TO SCRATCH THE NUMBER OF THE TICKET WITH A PINPOINT UPON THE
INSIDE OF THE CASE IT IS MORE HANDY THAN A LABEL AS THERE IS NO
RISK OF THE NUMBER BEING LOST OR TRANSPOSED THERE ARE NO LESS THAN
FOUR SUCH NUMBERS VISIBLE TO MY LENS ON THE INSIDE OF THIS CASE
INFERENCETHAT YOUR BROTHER WAS OFTEN AT LOW WATER SECONDARY
INFERENCETHAT HE HAD OCCASIONAL BURSTS OF PROSPERITY OR HE COULD
NOT HAVE REDEEMED THE PLEDGE FINALLY I ASK YOU TO LOOK AT THE INNER
PLATE WHICH CONTAINS THE KEYHOLE LOOK AT THE THOUSANDS OF
SCRATCHES ALL ROUND THE HOLEMARKS WHERE THE KEY HAS SLIPPED WHAT
SOBER MANS KEY COULD HAVE SCORED THOSE GROOVES BUT YOU WILL NEVER
SEE A DRUNKARDS WATCH WITHOUT THEM HE WINDS IT AT NIGHT AND HE
LEAVES THESE TRACES OF HIS UNSTEADY HAND WHERE IS THE MYSTERY IN ALL
THIS
IT IS AS CLEAR AS DAYLIGHT I ANSWERED I REGRET THE INJUSTICE
WHICH I DID YOU I SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE FAITH IN YOUR MARVELLOUS
FACULTY MAY I ASK WHETHER YOU HAVE ANY PROFESSIONAL INQUIRY ON FOOT
AT PRESENT
NONE HENCE THE COCAINE I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT BRAINWORK WHAT ELSE
IS THERE TO LIVE FOR STAND AT THE WINDOW HERE WAS EVER SUCH A
DREARY DISMAL UNPROFITABLE WORLD SEE HOW THE YELLOW FOG SWIRLS
DOWN THE STREET AND DRIFTS ACROSS THE DUNCOLORED HOUSES WHAT COULD
BE MORE HOPELESSLY PROSAIC AND MATERIAL WHAT IS THE USE OF HAVING
POWERS DOCTOR WHEN ONE HAS NO FIELD UPON WHICH TO EXERT THEM CRIME
IS COMMONPLACE EXISTENCE IS COMMONPLACE AND NO QUALITIES SAVE THOSE
WHICH ARE COMMONPLACE HAVE ANY FUNCTION UPON EARTH
I HAD OPENED MY MOUTH TO REPLY TO THIS TIRADE WHEN WITH A CRISP
KNOCK OUR LANDLADY ENTERED BEARING A CARD UPON THE BRASS SALVER
A YOUNG LADY FOR YOU SIR SHE SAID ADDRESSING MY COMPANION
MISS MARY MORSTAN HE READ HUM I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF THE
NAME ASK THE YOUNG LADY TO STEP UP MRS HUDSON DONT GO DOCTOR I
SHOULD PREFER THAT YOU REMAIN
CHAPTER II
THE STATEMENT OF THE CASE
MISS MORSTAN ENTERED THE ROOM WITH A FIRM STEP AND AN OUTWARD
COMPOSURE OF MANNER SHE WAS A BLONDE YOUNG LADY SMALL DAINTY WELL
GLOVED AND DRESSED IN THE MOST PERFECT TASTE THERE WAS HOWEVER A
PLAINNESS AND SIMPLICITY ABOUT HER COSTUME WHICH BORE WITH IT A
SUGGESTION OF LIMITED MEANS THE DRESS WAS A SOMBRE GRAYISH BEIGE
UNTRIMMED AND UNBRAIDED AND SHE WORE A SMALL TURBAN OF THE SAME DULL
HUE RELIEVED ONLY BY A SUSPICION OF WHITE FEATHER IN THE SIDE HER
FACE HAD NEITHER REGULARITY OF FEATURE NOR BEAUTY OF COMPLEXION BUT
HER EXPRESSION WAS SWEET AND AMIABLE AND HER LARGE BLUE EYES WERE
SINGULARLY SPIRITUAL AND SYMPATHETIC IN AN EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN WHICH
EXTENDS OVER MANY NATIONS AND THREE SEPARATE CONTINENTS I HAVE NEVER
LOOKED UPON A FACE WHICH GAVE A CLEARER PROMISE OF A REFINED AND
SENSITIVE NATURE I COULD NOT BUT OBSERVE THAT AS SHE TOOK THE SEAT
WHICH SHERLOCK HOLMES PLACED FOR HER HER LIP TREMBLED HER HAND
QUIVERED AND SHE SHOWED EVERY SIGN OF INTENSE INWARD AGITATION
I HAVE COME TO YOU MR HOLMES SHE SAID BECAUSE YOU ONCE ENABLED
MY EMPLOYER MRS CECIL FORRESTER TO UNRAVEL A LITTLE DOMESTIC
COMPLICATION SHE WAS MUCH IMPRESSED BY YOUR KINDNESS AND SKILL
MRS CECIL FORRESTER HE REPEATED THOUGHTFULLY I BELIEVE THAT I
WAS OF SOME SLIGHT SERVICE TO HER THE CASE HOWEVER AS I REMEMBER
IT WAS A VERY SIMPLE ONE
SHE DID NOT THINK SO BUT AT LEAST YOU CANNOT SAY THE SAME OF MINE
I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE ANYTHING MORE STRANGE MORE UTTERLY
INEXPLICABLE THAN THE SITUATION IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF
HOLMES RUBBED HIS HANDS AND HIS EYES GLISTENED HE LEANED FORWARD IN
HIS CHAIR WITH AN EXPRESSION OF EXTRAORDINARY CONCENTRATION UPON HIS
CLEARCUT HAWKLIKE FEATURES STATE YOUR CASE SAID HE IN BRISK
BUSINESS TONES
I FELT THAT MY POSITION WAS AN EMBARRASSING ONE YOU WILL I AM
SURE EXCUSE ME I SAID RISING FROM MY CHAIR
TO MY SURPRISE THE YOUNG LADY HELD UP HER GLOVED HAND TO DETAIN ME
IF YOUR FRIEND SHE SAID WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH TO STOP HE MIGHT
BE OF INESTIMABLE SERVICE TO ME
I RELAPSED INTO MY CHAIR
BRIEFLY SHE CONTINUED THE FACTS ARE THESE MY FATHER WAS AN
OFFICER IN AN INDIAN REGIMENT WHO SENT ME HOME WHEN I WAS QUITE A
CHILD MY MOTHER WAS DEAD AND I HAD NO RELATIVE IN ENGLAND I WAS
PLACED HOWEVER IN A COMFORTABLE BOARDING ESTABLISHMENT AT
EDINBURGH AND THERE I REMAINED UNTIL I WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE
IN THE YEAR MY FATHER WHO WAS SENIOR CAPTAIN OF HIS REGIMENT
OBTAINED TWELVE MONTHS LEAVE AND CAME HOME HE TELEGRAPHED TO ME
FROM LONDON THAT HE HAD ARRIVED ALL SAFE AND DIRECTED ME TO COME
DOWN AT ONCE GIVING THE LANGHAM HOTEL AS HIS ADDRESS HIS MESSAGE
AS I REMEMBER WAS FULL OF KINDNESS AND LOVE ON REACHING LONDON I
DROVE TO THE LANGHAM AND WAS INFORMED THAT CAPTAIN MORSTAN WAS
STAYING THERE BUT THAT HE HAD GONE OUT THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HAD NOT
YET RETURNED I WAITED ALL DAY WITHOUT NEWS OF HIM THAT NIGHT ON
THE ADVICE OF THE MANAGER OF THE HOTEL I COMMUNICATED WITH THE
POLICE AND NEXT MORNING WE ADVERTISED IN ALL THE PAPERS OUR
INQUIRIES LET TO NO RESULT AND FROM THAT DAY TO THIS NO WORD HAS
EVER BEEN HEARD OF MY UNFORTUNATE FATHER HE CAME HOME WITH HIS HEART
FULL OF HOPE TO FIND SOME PEACE SOME COMFORT AND INSTEAD SHE
PUT HER HAND TO HER THROAT AND A CHOKING SOB CUT SHORT THE SENTENCE
THE DATE ASKED HOLMES OPENING HIS NOTEBOOK
HE DISAPPEARED UPON THE D OF DECEMBER NEARLY TEN YEARS
AGO
HIS LUGGAGE
REMAINED AT THE HOTEL THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT TO SUGGEST A
CLUESOME CLOTHES SOME BOOKS AND A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF
CURIOSITIES FROM THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE OFFICERS
IN CHARGE OF THE CONVICTGUARD THERE
HAD HE ANY FRIENDS IN TOWN
ONLY ONE THAT WE KNOW OFMAJOR SHOLTO OF HIS OWN REGIMENT THE
TH BOMBAY INFANTRY THE MAJOR HAD RETIRED SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE
AND LIVED AT UPPER NORWOOD WE COMMUNICATED WITH HIM OF COURSE BUT
HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT HIS BROTHER OFFICER WAS IN ENGLAND
A SINGULAR CASE REMARKED HOLMES
I HAVE NOT YET DESCRIBED TO YOU THE MOST SINGULAR PART ABOUT SIX
YEARS AGOTO BE EXACT UPON THE TH OF MAY AN ADVERTISEMENT
APPEARED IN THE TIMES ASKING FOR THE ADDRESS OF MISS MARY MORSTAN AND
STATING THAT IT WOULD BE TO HER ADVANTAGE TO COME FORWARD THERE WAS
NO NAME OR ADDRESS APPENDED I HAD AT THAT TIME JUST ENTERED THE
FAMILY OF MRS CECIL FORRESTER IN THE CAPACITY OF GOVERNESS BY HER
ADVICE I PUBLISHED MY ADDRESS IN THE ADVERTISEMENT COLUMN THE SAME
DAY THERE ARRIVED THROUGH THE POST A SMALL CARDBOARD BOX ADDRESSED
TO ME WHICH I FOUND TO CONTAIN A VERY LARGE AND LUSTROUS PEARL NO
WORD OF WRITING WAS ENCLOSED SINCE THEN EVERY YEAR UPON THE SAME
DATE THERE HAS ALWAYS APPEARED A SIMILAR BOX CONTAINING A SIMILAR
PEARL WITHOUT ANY CLUE AS TO THE SENDER THEY HAVE BEEN PRONOUNCED
BY AN EXPERT TO BE OF A RARE VARIETY AND OF CONSIDERABLE VALUE YOU
CAN SEE FOR YOURSELVES THAT THEY ARE VERY HANDSOME SHE OPENED A
FLAT BOX AS SHE SPOKE AND SHOWED ME SIX OF THE FINEST PEARLS THAT I
HAD EVER SEEN
YOUR STATEMENT IS MOST INTERESTING SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS
ANYTHING ELSE OCCURRED TO YOU
YES AND NO LATER THAN TODAY THAT IS WHY I HAVE COME TO YOU THIS
MORNING I RECEIVED THIS LETTER WHICH YOU WILL PERHAPS READ FOR
YOURSELF
THANK YOU SAID HOLMES THE ENVELOPE TOO PLEASE POSTMARK

VERY MAN YOUR CORRESPONDENT SAYS TWO FRIENDS HE AND I
HAVE WORKED TOGETHER BEFORE
BUT WOULD HE COME SHE ASKED WITH SOMETHING APPEALING IN HER VOICE
AND EXPRESSION
I SHOULD BE PROUD AND HAPPY SAID I FERVENTLY IF I CAN BE OF ANY
SERVICE
YOU ARE BOTH VERY KIND SHE ANSWERED I HAVE LED A RETIRED LIFE
AND HAVE NO FRIENDS WHOM I COULD APPEAL TO IF I AM HERE AT SIX IT
WILL DO I SUPPOSE
YOU MUST NOT BE LATER SAID HOLMES THERE IS ONE OTHER POINT
HOWEVER IS THIS HANDWRITING THE SAME AS THAT UPON THE PEARLBOX
ADDRESSES
I HAVE THEM HERE SHE ANSWERED PRODUCING HALF A DOZEN PIECES OF
PAPER
YOU ARE CERTAINLY A MODEL CLIENT YOU HAVE THE CORRECT INTUITION
LET US SEE NOW HE SPREAD OUT THE PAPERS UPON THE TABLE AND GAVE
LITTLE DARTING GLANCES FROM ONE TO THE OTHER THEY ARE DISGUISED
HANDS EXCEPT THE LETTER HE SAID PRESENTLY BUT THERE CAN BE NO
QUESTION AS TO THE AUTHORSHIP SEE HOW THE IRREPRESSIBLE GREEK E WILL
BREAK OUT AND SEE THE TWIRL OF THE FINAL S THEY ARE UNDOUBTEDLY BY
THE SAME PERSON I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO SUGGEST FALSE HOPES MISS
MORSTAN BUT IS THERE ANY RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THIS HAND AND THAT OF
YOUR FATHER
NOTHING COULD BE MORE UNLIKE
I EXPECTED TO HEAR YOU SAY SO WE SHALL LOOK OUT FOR YOU THEN AT
SIX PRAY ALLOW ME TO KEEP THE PAPERS I MAY LOOK INTO THE MATTER
BEFORE THEN IT IS ONLY HALFPAST THREE AU REVOIR THEN
AU REVOIR SAID OUR VISITOR AND WITH A BRIGHT KINDLY GLANCE FROM
ONE TO THE OTHER OF US SHE REPLACED HER PEARLBOX IN HER BOSOM AND
HURRIED AWAY STANDING AT THE WINDOW I WATCHED HER WALKING BRISKLY
DOWN THE STREET UNTIL THE GRAY TURBAN AND WHITE FEATHER WERE BUT A
SPECK IN THE SOMBRE CROWD
WHAT A VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMAN I EXCLAIMED TURNING TO MY COMPANION
HE HAD LIT HIS PIPE AGAIN AND WAS LEANING BACK WITH DROOPING
EYELIDS IS SHE HE SAID LANGUIDLY I DID NOT OBSERVE
YOU REALLY ARE AN AUTOMATONA CALCULATINGMACHINE I CRIED
THERE IS SOMETHING POSITIVELY INHUMAN IN YOU AT TIMES
HE SMILED GENTLY IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE HE SAID NOT TO
ALLOW YOUR JUDGMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES A CLIENT IS
TO ME A MERE UNITA FACTOR IN A PROBLEM THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES
ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST
WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE
CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCEMONEY AND THE MOST REPELLANT MAN OF MY
ACQUAINTANCE IS A PHILANTHROPIST WHO HAS SPENT NEARLY A QUARTER OF A
MILLION UPON THE LONDON POOR
IN THIS CASE HOWEVER
I NEVER MAKE EXCEPTIONS AN EXCEPTION DISPROVES THE RULE HAVE YOU
EVER HAD OCCASION TO STUDY CHARACTER IN HANDWRITING WHAT DO YOU MAKE
OF THIS FELLOWS SCRIBBLE
IT IS LEGIBLE AND REGULAR I ANSWERED A MAN OF BUSINESS HABITS
AND SOME FORCE OF CHARACTER
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD LOOK AT HIS LONG LETTERS HE SAID THEY
HARDLY RISE ABOVE THE COMMON HERD THAT D MIGHT BE AN A AND THAT L
AN E MEN OF CHARACTER ALWAYS DIFFERENTIATE THEIR LONG LETTERS
HOWEVER ILLEGIBLY THEY MAY WRITE THERE IS VACILLATION IN HIS KS AND
SELFESTEEM IN HIS CAPITALS I AM GOING OUT NOW I HAVE SOME FEW
REFERENCES TO MAKE LET ME RECOMMEND THIS BOOKONE OF THE MOST
REMARKABLE EVER PENNED IT IS WINWOOD READES MARTYRDOM OF MAN I
SHALL BE BACK IN AN HOUR
I SAT IN THE WINDOW WITH THE VOLUME IN MY HAND BUT MY THOUGHTS WERE
FAR FROM THE DARING SPECULATIONS OF THE WRITER MY MIND RAN UPON OUR
LATE VISITORHER SMILES THE DEEP RICH TONES OF HER VOICE THE
STRANGE MYSTERY WHICH OVERHUNG HER LIFE IF SHE WERE SEVENTEEN AT THE
TIME OF HER FATHERS DISAPPEARANCE SHE MUST BE SEVENANDTWENTY
NOWA SWEET AGE WHEN YOUTH HAS LOST ITS SELFCONSCIOUSNESS AND
BECOME A LITTLE SOBERED BY EXPERIENCE SO I SAT AND MUSED UNTIL SUCH
DANGEROUS THOUGHTS CAME INTO MY HEAD THAT I HURRIED AWAY TO MY DESK
AND PLUNGED FURIOUSLY INTO THE LATEST TREATISE UPON PATHOLOGY WHAT
WAS I AN ARMY SURGEON WITH A WEAK LEG AND A WEAKER BANKINGACCOUNT
THAT I SHOULD DARE TO THINK OF SUCH THINGS SHE WAS A UNIT A
FACTORNOTHING MORE IF MY FUTURE WERE BLACK IT WAS BETTER SURELY
TO FACE IT LIKE A MAN THAN TO ATTEMPT TO BRIGHTEN IT BY MERE
WILLOTHEWISPS OF THE IMAGINATION
CHAPTER III
IN QUEST OF A SOLUTION
IT WAS HALFPAST FIVE BEFORE HOLMES RETURNED HE WAS BRIGHT EAGER
AND IN EXCELLENT SPIRITSA MOOD WHICH IN HIS CASE ALTERNATED WITH
FITS OF THE BLACKEST DEPRESSION
THERE IS NO GREAT MYSTERY IN THIS MATTER HE SAID TAKING THE CUP
OF TEA WHICH I HAD POURED OUT FOR HIM THE FACTS APPEAR TO ADMIT OF
ONLY ONE EXPLANATION
WHAT YOU HAVE SOLVED IT ALREADY
WELL THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO SAY I HAVE DISCOVERED A SUGGESTIVE
FACT THAT IS ALL IT IS HOWEVER VERY SUGGESTIVE THE DETAILS ARE
STILL TO BE ADDED I HAVE JUST FOUND ON CONSULTING THE BACK FILES OF
THE TIMES THAT MAJOR SHOLTO OF UPPER NORWORD LATE OF THE TH
BOMBAY INFANTRY DIED UPON THE TH OF APRIL I MAY BE VERY OBTUSE HOLMES
BUT I FAIL TO SEE WHAT THIS SUGGESTS
NO YOU SURPRISE ME LOOK AT IT IN THIS WAY THEN CAPTAIN MORSTAN
DISAPPEARS THE ONLY PERSON IN LONDON WHOM HE COULD HAVE VISITED IS
MAJOR SHOLTO MAJOR SHOLTO DENIES HAVING HEARD THAT HE WAS IN LONDON
FOUR YEARS LATER SHOLTO DIES WITHIN A WEEK OF HIS DEATH CAPTAIN
MORSTANS DAUGHTER RECEIVES A VALUABLE PRESENT WHICH IS REPEATED
FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND NOW CULMINATES IN A LETTER WHICH DESCRIBES HER
AS A WRONGED WOMAN WHAT WRONG CAN IT REFER TO EXCEPT THIS
DEPRIVATION OF HER FATHER AND WHY SHOULD THE PRESENTS BEGIN
IMMEDIATELY AFTER SHOLTOS DEATH UNLESS IT IS THAT SHOLTOS HEIR
KNOWS SOMETHING OF THE MYSTERY AND DESIRES TO MAKE COMPENSATION HAVE
YOU ANY ALTERNATIVE THEORY WHICH WILL MEET THE FACTS
BUT WHAT A STRANGE COMPENSATION AND HOW STRANGELY MADE WHY TOO
SHOULD HE WRITE A LETTER NOW RATHER THAN SIX YEARS AGO AGAIN THE
LETTER SPEAKS OF GIVING HER JUSTICE WHAT JUSTICE CAN SHE HAVE IT IS
TOO MUCH TO SUPPOSE THAT HER FATHER IS STILL ALIVE THERE IS NO OTHER
INJUSTICE IN HER CASE THAT YOU KNOW OF
THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES THERE ARE CERTAINLY DIFFICULTIES SAID
SHERLOCK HOLMES PENSIVELY BUT OUR EXPEDITION OF TONIGHT WILL
SOLVE THEM ALL AH HERE IS A FOURWHEELER AND MISS MORSTAN IS
INSIDE ARE YOU ALL READY THEN WE HAD BETTER GO DOWN FOR IT IS A
LITTLE PAST THE HOUR
I PICKED UP MY HAT AND MY HEAVIEST STICK BUT I OBSERVED THAT HOLMES
TOOK HIS REVOLVER FROM HIS DRAWER AND SLIPPED IT INTO HIS POCKET IT
WAS CLEAR THAT HE THOUGHT THAT OUR NIGHTS WORK MIGHT BE A SERIOUS
ONE
MISS MORSTAN WAS MUFFLED IN A DARK CLOAK AND HER SENSITIVE FACE WAS
COMPOSED BUT PALE SHE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE THAN WOMAN IF SHE DID NOT
FEEL SOME UNEASINESS AT THE STRANGE ENTERPRISE UPON WHICH WE WERE
EMBARKING YET HER SELFCONTROL WAS PERFECT AND SHE READILY ANSWERED
THE FEW ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WHICH SHERLOCK HOLMES PUT TO HER
MAJOR SHOLTO WAS A VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND OF PAPAS SHE SAID HIS
LETTERS WERE FULL OF ALLUSIONS TO THE MAJOR HE AND PAPA WERE IN
COMMAND OF THE TROOPS AT THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS SO THEY WERE THROWN A
GREAT DEAL TOGETHER BY THE WAY A CURIOUS PAPER WAS FOUND IN PAPAS
DESK WHICH NO ONE COULD UNDERSTAND I DONT SUPPOSE THAT IT IS OF THE
SLIGHTEST IMPORTANCE BUT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT CARE TO SEE IT SO I
BROUGHT IT WITH ME IT IS HERE
HOLMES UNFOLDED THE PAPER CAREFULLY AND SMOOTHED IT OUT UPON HIS
KNEE HE THEN VERY METHODICALLY EXAMINED IT ALL OVER WITH HIS DOUBLE
LENS
IT IS PAPER OF NATIVE INDIAN MANUFACTURE HE REMARKED IT HAS AT
SOME TIME BEEN PINNED TO A BOARD THE DIAGRAM UPON IT APPEARS TO BE A
PLAN OF PART OF A LARGE BUILDING WITH NUMEROUS HALLS CORRIDORS AND
PASSAGES AT ONE POINT IS A SMALL CROSS DONE IN RED INK AND ABOVE IT
IS FROM LEFT IN FADED PENCILWRITING IN THE LEFTHAND
CORNER IS A CURIOUS HIEROGLYPHIC LIKE FOUR CROSSES IN A LINE WITH
THEIR ARMS TOUCHING BESIDE IT IS WRITTEN IN VERY ROUGH AND COARSE
CHARACTERS THE SIGN OF THE FOURJONATHAN SMALL MAHOMET SINGH
ABDULLAH KHAN DOST AKBAR NO I CONFESS THAT I DO NOT SEE HOW THIS
BEARS UPON THE MATTER YET IT IS EVIDENTLY A DOCUMENT OF IMPORTANCE
IT HAS BEEN KEPT CAREFULLY IN A POCKETBOOK FOR THE ONE SIDE IS AS
CLEAN AS THE OTHER
IT WAS IN HIS POCKETBOOK THAT WE FOUND IT
PRESERVE IT CAREFULLY THEN MISS MORSTAN FOR IT MAY PROVE TO BE OF
USE TO US I BEGIN TO SUSPECT THAT THIS MATTER MAY TURN OUT TO BE
MUCH DEEPER AND MORE SUBTLE THAN I AT FIRST SUPPOSED I MUST
RECONSIDER MY IDEAS HE LEANED BACK IN THE CAB AND I COULD SEE BY
HIS DRAWN BROW AND HIS VACANT EYE THAT HE WAS THINKING INTENTLY MISS
MORSTAN AND I CHATTED IN AN UNDERTONE ABOUT OUR PRESENT EXPEDITION
AND ITS POSSIBLE OUTCOME BUT OUR COMPANION MAINTAINED HIS
IMPENETRABLE RESERVE UNTIL THE END OF OUR JOURNEY
IT WAS A SEPTEMBER EVENING AND NOT YET SEVEN OCLOCK BUT THE DAY
HAD BEEN A DREARY ONE AND A DENSE DRIZZLY FOG LAY LOW UPON THE GREAT
CITY MUDCOLORED CLOUDS DROOPED SADLY OVER THE MUDDY STREETS DOWN
THE STRAND THE LAMPS WERE BUT MISTY SPLOTCHES OF DIFFUSED LIGHT WHICH
THREW A FEEBLE CIRCULAR GLIMMER UPON THE SLIMY PAVEMENT THE YELLOW
GLARE FROM THE SHOPWINDOWS STREAMED OUT INTO THE STEAMY VAPOROUS
AIR AND THREW A MURKY SHIFTING RADIANCE ACROSS THE CROWDED
THOROUGHFARE THERE WAS TO MY MIND SOMETHING EERIE AND GHOSTLIKE
IN THE ENDLESS PROCESSION OF FACES WHICH FLITTED ACROSS THESE NARROW
BARS OF LIGHTSAD FACES AND GLAD HAGGARD AND MERRY LIKE ALL HUMAN
KIND THEY FLITTED FROM THE GLOOM INTO THE LIGHT AND SO BACK INTO
THE GLOOM ONCE MORE I AM NOT SUBJECT TO IMPRESSIONS BUT THE DULL
HEAVY EVENING WITH THE STRANGE BUSINESS UPON WHICH WE WERE ENGAGED
COMBINED TO MAKE ME NERVOUS AND DEPRESSED I COULD SEE FROM MISS
MORSTANS MANNER THAT SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM THE SAME FEELING HOLMES
ALONE COULD RISE SUPERIOR TO PETTY INFLUENCES HE HELD HIS OPEN
NOTEBOOK UPON HIS KNEE AND FROM TIME TO TIME HE JOTTED DOWN FIGURES
AND MEMORANDA IN THE LIGHT OF HIS POCKETLANTERN
AT THE LYCEUM THEATRE THE CROWDS WERE ALREADY THICK AT THE
SIDEENTRANCES IN FRONT A CONTINUOUS STREAM OF HANSOMS AND
FOURWHEELERS WERE RATTLING UP DISCHARGING THEIR CARGOES OF
SHIRTFRONTED MEN AND BESHAWLED BEDIAMONDED WOMEN WE HAD HARDLY
REACHED THE THIRD PILLAR WHICH WAS OUR RENDEZVOUS BEFORE A SMALL
DARK BRISK MAN IN THE DRESS OF A COACHMAN ACCOSTED US
ARE YOU THE PARTIES WHO COME WITH MISS MORSTAN HE ASKED
I AM MISS MORSTAN AND THESE TWO GENTLEMEN ARE MY FRIENDS SAID
SHE
HE BENT A PAIR OF WONDERFULLY PENETRATING AND QUESTIONING EYES UPON
US YOU WILL EXCUSE ME MISS HE SAID WITH A CERTAIN DOGGED MANNER
BUT I WAS TO ASK YOU TO GIVE ME YOUR WORD THAT NEITHER OF YOUR
COMPANIONS IS A POLICEOFFICER
I GIVE YOU MY WORD ON THAT SHE ANSWERED
HE GAVE A SHRILL WHISTLE ON WHICH A STREET ARAB LED ACROSS A
FOURWHEELER AND OPENED THE DOOR THE MAN WHO HAD ADDRESSED US
MOUNTED TO THE BOX WHILE WE TOOK OUR PLACES INSIDE WE HAD HARDLY
DONE SO BEFORE THE DRIVER WHIPPED UP HIS HORSE AND WE PLUNGED AWAY
AT A FURIOUS PACE THROUGH THE FOGGY STREETS
THE SITUATION WAS A CURIOUS ONE WE WERE DRIVING TO AN UNKNOWN PLACE
ON AN UNKNOWN ERRAND YET OUR INVITATION WAS EITHER A COMPLETE
HOAXWHICH WAS AN INCONCEIVABLE HYPOTHESISOR ELSE WE HAD GOOD
REASON TO THINK THAT IMPORTANT ISSUES MIGHT HANG UPON OUR JOURNEY
MISS MORSTANS DEMEANOR WAS AS RESOLUTE AND COLLECTED AS EVER I
ENDEAVORED TO CHEER AND AMUSE HER BY REMINISCENCES OF MY ADVENTURES
IN AFGHANISTAN BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH I WAS MYSELF SO EXCITED AT
OUR SITUATION AND SO CURIOUS AS TO OUR DESTINATION THAT MY STORIES
WERE SLIGHTLY INVOLVED TO THIS DAY SHE DECLARES THAT I TOLD HER ONE
MOVING ANECDOTE AS TO HOW A MUSKET LOOKED INTO MY TENT AT THE DEAD OF
NIGHT AND HOW I FIRED A DOUBLEBARRELLED TIGER CUB AT IT AT FIRST I
HAD SOME IDEA AS TO THE DIRECTION IN WHICH WE WERE DRIVING BUT SOON
WHAT WITH OUR PACE THE FOG AND MY OWN LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF LONDON
I LOST MY BEARINGS AND KNEW NOTHING SAVE THAT WE SEEMED TO BE GOING
A VERY LONG WAY SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS NEVER AT FAULT HOWEVER AND HE
MUTTERED THE NAMES AS THE CAB RATTLED THROUGH SQUARES AND IN AND OUT
BY TORTUOUS BYSTREETS
ROCHESTER ROW SAID HE NOW VINCENT SQUARE NOW WE COME OUT ON THE
VAUXHALL BRIDGE ROAD WE ARE MAKING FOR THE SURREY SIDE APPARENTLY
YES I THOUGHT SO NOW WE ARE ON THE BRIDGE YOU CAN CATCH GLIMPSES
OF THE RIVER
WE DID INDEED BET A FLEETING VIEW OF A STRETCH OF THE THAMES WITH THE
LAMPS SHINING UPON THE BROAD SILENT WATER BUT OUR CAB DASHED ON
AND WAS SOON INVOLVED IN A LABYRINTH OF STREETS UPON THE OTHER SIDE
WORDSWORTH ROAD SAID MY COMPANION PRIORY ROAD LARK HALL LANE
STOCKWELL PLACE ROBERT STREET COLD HARBOR LANE OUR QUEST DOES NOT
APPEAR TO TAKE US TO VERY FASHIONABLE REGIONS
WE HAD INDEED REACHED A QUESTIONABLE AND FORBIDDING NEIGHBORHOOD
LONG LINES OF DULL BRICK HOUSES WERE ONLY RELIEVED BY THE COARSE
GLARE AND TAWDRY BRILLIANCY OF PUBLIC HOUSES AT THE CORNER THEN CAME
ROWS OF TWOSTORIED VILLAS EACH WITH A FRONTING OF MINIATURE GARDEN
AND THEN AGAIN INTERMINABLE LINES OF NEW STARING BRICK
BUILDINGSTHE MONSTER TENTACLES WHICH THE GIANT CITY WAS THROWING
OUT INTO THE COUNTRY AT LAST THE CAB DREW UP AT THE THIRD HOUSE IN A
NEW TERRACE NONE OF THE OTHER HOUSES WERE INHABITED AND THAT AT
WHICH WE STOPPED WAS AS DARK AS ITS NEIGHBORS SAVE FOR A SINGLE
GLIMMER IN THE KITCHEN WINDOW ON OUR KNOCKING HOWEVER THE DOOR WAS
INSTANTLY THROWN OPEN BY A HINDOO SERVANT CLAD IN A YELLOW TURBAN
WHITE LOOSEFITTING CLOTHES AND A YELLOW SASH THERE WAS SOMETHING
STRANGELY INCONGRUOUS IN THIS ORIENTAL FIGURE FRAMED IN THE
COMMONPLACE DOORWAY OF A THIRDRATE SUBURBAN DWELLINGHOUSE
THE SAHIB AWAITS YOU SAID HE AND EVEN AS HE SPOKE THERE CAME A
HIGH PIPING VOICE FROM SOME INNER ROOM SHOW THEM IN TO ME
KHITMUTGAR IT CRIED SHOW THEM STRAIGHT IN TO ME
CHAPTER IV
THE STORY OF THE BALDHEADED MAN
WE FOLLOWED THE INDIAN DOWN A SORDID AND COMMON PASSAGE ILL LIT AND
WORSE FURNISHED UNTIL HE CAME TO A DOOR UPON THE RIGHT WHICH HE
THREW OPEN A BLAZE OF YELLOW LIGHT STREAMED OUT UPON US AND IN THE
CENTRE OF THE GLARE THERE STOOD A SMALL MAN WITH A VERY HIGH HEAD A
BRISTLE OF RED HAIR ALL ROUND THE FRINGE OF IT AND A BALD SHINING
SCALP WHICH SHOT OUT FROM AMONG IT LIKE A MOUNTAINPEAK FROM
FIRTREES HE WRITHED HIS HANDS TOGETHER AS HE STOOD AND HIS
FEATURES WERE IN A PERPETUAL JERK NOW SMILING NOW SCOWLING BUT
NEVER FOR AN INSTANT IN REPOSE NATURE HAD GIVEN HIM A PENDULOUS LIP
AND A TOO VISIBLE LINE OF YELLOW AND IRREGULAR TEETH WHICH HE STROVE
FEEBLY TO CONCEAL BY CONSTANTLY PASSING HIS HAND OVER THE LOWER PART
OF HIS FACE IN SPITE OF HIS OBTRUSIVE BALDNESS HE GAVE THE
IMPRESSION OF YOUTH IN POINT OF FACT HE HAD JUST TURNED HIS
THIRTIETH YEAR
YOUR SERVANT MISS MORSTAN HE KEPT REPEATING IN A THIN HIGH
VOICE YOUR SERVANT GENTLEMEN PRAY STEP INTO MY LITTLE SANCTUM A
SMALL PLACE MISS BUT FURNISHED TO MY OWN LIKING AN OASIS OF ART
IN THE HOWLING DESERT OF SOUTH LONDON
WE WERE ALL ASTONISHED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE APARTMENT INTO WHICH
HE INVITED US IN THAT SORRY HOUSE IT LOOKED AS OUT OF PLACE AS A
DIAMOND OF THE FIRST WATER IN A SETTING OF BRASS THE RICHEST AND
GLOSSIEST OF CURTAINS AND TAPESTRIES DRAPED THE WALLS LOOPED BACK
HERE AND THERE TO EXPOSE SOME RICHLYMOUNTED PAINTING OR ORIENTAL
VASE THE CARPET WAS OF AMBERANDBLACK SO SOFT AND SO THICK THAT
THE FOOT SANK PLEASANTLY INTO IT AS INTO A BED OF MOSS TWO GREAT
TIGERSKINS THROWN ATHWART IT INCREASED THE SUGGESTION OF EASTERN
LUXURY AS DID A HUGE HOOKAH WHICH STOOD UPON A MAT IN THE CORNER A
LAMP IN THE FASHION OF A SILVER DOVE WAS HUNG FROM AN ALMOST
INVISIBLE GOLDEN WIRE IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM AS IT BURNED IT
FILLED THE AIR WITH A SUBTLE AND AROMATIC ODOR
MR THADDEUS SHOLTO SAID THE LITTLE MAN STILL JERKING AND
SMILING THAT IS MY NAME YOU ARE MISS MORSTAN OF COURSE AND THESE
GENTLEMEN
THIS IS MR SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THIS IS DR WATSON
A DOCTOR EH CRIED HE MUCH EXCITED HAVE YOU YOUR STETHOSCOPE
MIGHT I ASK YOUWOULD YOU HAVE THE KINDNESS I HAVE GRAVE DOUBTS AS
TO MY MITRAL VALVE IF YOU WOULD BE SO VERY GOOD THE AORTIC I MAY
RELY UPON BUT I SHOULD VALUE YOUR OPINION UPON THE MITRAL
I LISTENED TO HIS HEART AS REQUESTED BUT WAS UNABLE TO FIND
ANYTHING AMISS SAVE INDEED THAT HE WAS IN AN ECSTASY OF FEAR FOR HE
SHIVERED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IT APPEARS TO BE NORMAL I SAID YOU
HAVE NO CAUSE FOR UNEASINESS
YOU WILL EXCUSE MY ANXIETY MISS MORSTAN HE REMARKED AIRILY I
AM A GREAT SUFFERER AND I HAVE LONG HAD SUSPICIONS AS TO THAT VALVE
I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT THEY ARE UNWARRANTED HAD YOUR FATHER
MISS MORSTAN REFRAINED FROM THROWING A STRAIN UPON HIS HEART HE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALIVE NOW
I COULD HAVE STRUCK THE MAN ACROSS THE FACE SO HOT WAS I AT THIS
CALLOUS AND OFFHAND REFERENCE TO SO DELICATE A MATTER MISS MORSTAN
SAT DOWN AND HER FACE GREW WHITE TO THE LIPS I KNEW IN MY HEART
THAT HE WAS DEAD SAID SHE
I CAN GIVE YOU EVERY INFORMATION SAID HE AND WHAT IS MORE I
CAN DO YOU JUSTICE AND I WILL TOO WHATEVER BROTHER BARTHOLOMEW MAY
SAY I AM SO GLAD TO HAVE YOUR FRIENDS HERE NOT ONLY AS AN ESCORT TO
YOU BUT ALSO AS WITNESSES TO WHAT I AM ABOUT TO DO AND SAY THE
THREE OF US CAN SHOW A BOLD FRONT TO BROTHER BARTHOLOMEW BUT LET US
HAVE NO OUTSIDERSNO POLICE OR OFFICIALS WE CAN SETTLE EVERYTHING
SATISFACTORILY AMONG OURSELVES WITHOUT ANY INTERFERENCE NOTHING
WOULD ANNOY BROTHER BARTHOLOMEW MORE THAN ANY PUBLICITY HE SAT DOWN
UPON A LOW SETTEE AND BLINKED AT US INQUIRINGLY WITH HIS WEAK WATERY
BLUE EYES
FOR MY PART SAID HOLMES WHATEVER YOU MAY CHOOSE TO SAY WILL GO
NO FURTHER
I NODDED TO SHOW MY AGREEMENT
THAT IS WELL THAT IS WELL SAID HE MAY I OFFER YOU A GLASS OF
CHIANTI MISS MORSTAN OR OF TOKAY I KEEP NO OTHER WINES SHALL I
OPEN A FLASK NO WELL THEN I TRUST THAT YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION TO
TOBACCOSMOKE TO THE MILD BALSAMIC ODOR OF THE EASTERN TOBACCO I AM
A LITTLE NERVOUS AND I FIND MY HOOKAH AN INVALUABLE SEDATIVE HE
APPLIED A TAPER TO THE GREAT BOWL AND THE SMOKE BUBBLED MERRILY
THROUGH THE ROSEWATER WE SAT ALL THREE IN A SEMICIRCLE WITH OUR
HEADS ADVANCED AND OUR CHINS UPON OUR HANDS WHILE THE STRANGE
JERKY LITTLE FELLOW WITH HIS HIGH SHINING HEAD PUFFED UNEASILY IN
THE CENTRE
WHEN I FIRST DETERMINED TO MAKE THIS COMMUNICATION TO YOU SAID HE
I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN YOU MY ADDRESS BUT I FEARED THAT YOU MIGHT
DISREGARD MY REQUEST AND BRING UNPLEASANT PEOPLE WITH YOU I TOOK THE
LIBERTY THEREFORE OF MAKING AN APPOINTMENT IN SUCH A WAY THAT MY
MAN WILLIAMS MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE YOU FIRST I HAVE COMPLETE
CONFIDENCE IN HIS DISCRETION AND HE HAD ORDERS IF HE WERE
DISSATISFIED TO PROCEED NO FURTHER IN THE MATTER YOU WILL EXCUSE
THESE PRECAUTIONS BUT I AM A MAN OF SOMEWHAT RETIRING AND I MIGHT
EVEN SAY REFINED TASTES AND THERE IS NOTHING MORE UNAESTHETIC THAN
A POLICEMAN I HAVE A NATURAL SHRINKING FROM ALL FORMS OF ROUGH
MATERIALISM I SELDOM COME IN CONTACT WITH THE ROUGH CROWD I LIVE
AS YOU SEE WITH SOME LITTLE ATMOSPHERE OF ELEGANCE AROUND ME I MAY
CALL MYSELF A PATRON OF THE ARTS IT IS MY WEAKNESS THE LANDSCAPE IS
A GENUINE COROT AND THOUGH A CONNOISSEUR MIGHT PERHAPS THROW A
DOUBT UPON THAT SALVATOR ROSA THERE CANNOT BE THE LEAST QUESTION
ABOUT THE BOUGUEREAU I AM PARTIAL TO THE MODERN FRENCH SCHOOL
YOU WILL EXCUSE ME MR SHOLTO SAID MISS MORSTAN BUT I AM HERE
AT YOUR REQUEST TO LEARN SOMETHING WHICH YOU DESIRE TO TELL ME IT IS
VERY LATE AND I SHOULD DESIRE THE INTERVIEW TO BE AS SHORT AS
POSSIBLE
AT THE BEST IT MUST TAKE SOME TIME HE ANSWERED FOR WE SHALL
CERTAINLY HAVE TO GO TO NORWOOD AND SEE BROTHER BARTHOLOMEW WE SHALL
ALL GO AND TRY IF WE CAN GET THE BETTER OF BROTHER BARTHOLOMEW HE IS
VERY ANGRY WITH ME FOR TAKING THE COURSE WHICH HAS SEEMED RIGHT TO
ME I HAD QUITE HIGH WORDS WITH HIM LAST NIGHT YOU CANNOT IMAGINE
WHAT A TERRIBLE FELLOW HE IS WHEN HE IS ANGRY
IF WE ARE TO GO TO NORWOOD IT WOULD PERHAPS BE AS WELL TO START AT
ONCE I VENTURED TO REMARK
HE LAUGHED UNTIL HIS EARS WERE QUITE RED THAT WOULD HARDLY DO HE
CRIED I DONT KNOW WHAT HE WOULD SAY IF I BROUGHT YOU IN THAT
SUDDEN WAY NO I MUST PREPARE YOU BY SHOWING YOU HOW WE ALL STAND TO
EACH OTHER IN THE FIRST PLACE I MUST TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE
SEVERAL POINTS IN THE STORY OF WHICH I AM MYSELF IGNORANT I CAN ONLY
LAY THE FACTS BEFORE YOU AS FAR AS I KNOW THEM MYSELF
MY FATHER WAS AS YOU MAY HAVE GUESSED MAJOR JOHN SHOLTO ONCE OF
THE INDIAN ARMY HE RETIRED SOME ELEVEN YEARS AGO AND CAME TO LIVE
AT PONDICHERRY LODGE IN UPPER NORWOOD HE HAD PROSPERED IN INDIA AND
BROUGHT BACK WITH HIM A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY A LARGE COLLECTION
OF VALUABLE CURIOSITIES AND A STAFF OF NATIVE SERVANTS WITH THESE
ADVANTAGES HE BOUGHT HIMSELF A HOUSE AND LIVED IN GREAT LUXURY MY
TWINBROTHER BARTHOLOMEW AND I WERE THE ONLY CHILDREN
I VERY WELL REMEMBER THE SENSATION WHICH WAS CAUSED BY THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF CAPTAIN MORSTAN WE READ THE DETAILS IN THE PAPERS
AND KNOWING THAT HE HAD BEEN A FRIEND OF OUR FATHERS WE DISCUSSED
THE CASE FREELY IN HIS PRESENCE HE USED TO JOIN IN OUR SPECULATIONS
AS TO WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED NEVER FOR AN INSTANT DID WE SUSPECT
THAT HE HAD THE WHOLE SECRET HIDDEN IN HIS OWN BREASTTHAT OF ALL
MEN HE ALONE KNEW THE FATE OF ARTHUR MORSTAN
WE DID KNOW HOWEVER THAT SOME MYSTERYSOME POSITIVE
DANGEROVERHUNG OUR FATHER HE WAS VERY FEARFUL OF GOING OUT ALONE
AND HE ALWAYS EMPLOYED TWO PRIZEFIGHTERS TO ACT AS PORTERS AT
PONDICHERRY LODGE WILLIAMS WHO DROVE YOU TONIGHT WAS ONE OF THEM
HE WAS ONCE LIGHTWEIGHT CHAMPION OF ENGLAND OUR FATHER WOULD NEVER
TELL US WHAT IT WAS HE FEARED BUT HE HAD A MOST MARKED AVERSION TO
MEN WITH WOODEN LEGS ON ONE OCCASION HE ACTUALLY FIRED HIS REVOLVER
AT A WOODENLEGGED MAN WHO PROVED TO BE A HARMLESS TRADESMAN
CANVASSING FOR ORDERS WE HAD TO PAY A LARGE SUM TO HUSH THE MATTER
UP MY BROTHER AND I USED TO THINK THIS A MERE WHIM OF MY FATHERS
BUT EVENTS HAVE SINCE LED US TO CHANGE OUR OPINION
EARLY IN MY FATHER RECEIVED A LETTER FROM INDIA WHICH WAS A
GREAT SHOCK TO HIM HE NEARLY FAINTED AT THE BREAKFASTTABLE WHEN HE
OPENED IT AND FROM THAT DAY HE SICKENED TO HIS DEATH WHAT WAS IN
THE LETTER WE COULD NEVER DISCOVER BUT I COULD SEE AS HE HELD IT
THAT IT WAS SHORT AND WRITTEN IN A SCRAWLING HAND HE HAD SUFFERED
FOR YEARS FROM AN ENLARGED SPLEEN BUT HE NOW BECAME RAPIDLY WORSE
AND TOWARDS THE END OF APRIL WE WERE INFORMED THAT HE WAS BEYOND ALL
HOPE AND THAT HE WISHED TO MAKE A LAST COMMUNICATION TO US
WHEN WE ENTERED HIS ROOM HE WAS PROPPED UP WITH PILLOWS AND
BREATHING HEAVILY HE BESOUGHT US TO LOCK THE DOOR AND TO COME UPON
EITHER SIDE OF THE BED THEN GRASPING OUR HANDS HE MADE A
REMARKABLE STATEMENT TO US IN A VOICE WHICH WAS BROKEN AS MUCH BY
EMOTION AS BY PAIN I SHALL TRY AND GIVE IT TO YOU IN HIS OWN VERY
WORDS
I HAVE ONLY ONE THING HE SAID WHICH WEIGHS UPON MY MIND AT THIS
SUPREME MOMENT IT IS MY TREATMENT OF POOR MORSTANS ORPHAN THE
CURSED GREED WHICH HAS BEEN MY BESETTING SIN THROUGH LIFE HAS
WITHHELD FROM HER THE TREASURE HALF AT LEAST OF WHICH SHOULD HAVE
BEEN HERS AND YET I HAVE MADE NO USE OF IT MYSELFSO BLIND AND
FOOLISH A THING IS AVARICE THE MERE FEELING OF POSSESSION HAS BEEN
SO DEAR TO ME THAT I COULD NOT BEAR TO SHARE IT WITH ANOTHER SEE
THAT CHAPLET DIPPED WITH PEARLS BESIDE THE QUININEBOTTLE EVEN THAT
I COULD NOT BEAR TO PART WITH ALTHOUGH I HAD GOT IT OUT WITH THE
DESIGN OF SENDING IT TO HER YOU MY SONS WILL GIVE HER A FAIR SHARE
OF THE AGRA TREASURE BUT SEND HER NOTHINGNOT EVEN THE
CHAPLETUNTIL I AM GONE AFTER ALL MEN HAVE BEEN AS BAD AS THIS AND
HAVE RECOVERED
I WILL TELL YOU HOW MORSTAN DIED HE CONTINUED HE HAD SUFFERED
FOR YEARS FROM A WEAK HEART BUT HE CONCEALED IT FROM EVERY ONE I
ALONE KNEW IT WHEN IN INDIA HE AND I THROUGH A REMARKABLE CHAIN OF
CIRCUMSTANCES CAME INTO POSSESSION OF A CONSIDERABLE TREASURE I
BROUGHT IT OVER TO ENGLAND AND ON THE NIGHT OF MORSTANS ARRIVAL HE
CAME STRAIGHT OVER HERE TO CLAIM HIS SHARE HE WALKED OVER FROM THE
STATION AND WAS ADMITTED BY MY FAITHFUL LAL CHOWDAR WHO IS NOW
DEAD MORSTAN AND I HAD A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS TO THE DIVISION OF
THE TREASURE AND WE CAME TO HEATED WORDS MORSTAN HAD SPRUNG OUT OF
HIS CHAIR IN A PAROXYSM OF ANGER WHEN HE SUDDENLY PRESSED HIS HAND
TO HIS SIDE HIS FACE TURNED A DUSKY HUE AND HE FELL BACKWARDS
CUTTING HIS HEAD AGAINST THE CORNER OF THE TREASURECHEST WHEN I
STOOPED OVER HIM I FOUND TO MY HORROR THAT HE WAS DEAD
FOR A LONG TIME I SAT HALF DISTRACTED WONDERING WHAT I SHOULD DO
MY FIRST IMPULSE WAS OF COURSE TO CALL FOR ASSISTANCE BUT I COULD
NOT BUT RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS EVERY CHANCE THAT I WOULD BE ACCUSED
OF HIS MURDER HIS DEATH AT THE MOMENT OF A QUARREL AND THE GASH IN
HIS HEAD WOULD BE BLACK AGAINST ME AGAIN AN OFFICIAL INQUIRY COULD
NOT BE MADE WITHOUT BRINGING OUT SOME FACTS ABOUT THE TREASURE WHICH
I WAS PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO KEEP SECRET HE HAD TOLD ME THAT NO
SOUL UPON EARTH KNEW WHERE HE HAD GONE THERE SEEMED TO BE NO
NECESSITY WHY ANY SOUL EVER SHOULD KNOW
I WAS STILL PONDERING OVER THE MATTER WHEN LOOKING UP I SAW MY
SERVANT LAL CHOWDAR IN THE DOORWAY HE STOLE IN AND BOLTED THE DOOR
BEHIND HIM DO NOT FEAR SAHIB HE SAID NO ONE NEED KNOW THAT YOU
HAVE KILLED HIM LET US HIDE HIM AWAY AND WHO IS THE WISER I DID
NOT KILL HIM SAID I LAL CHOWDAR SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SMILED I
HEARD IT ALL SAHIB SAID HE I HEARD YOU QUARREL AND I HEARD THE
BLOW BUT MY LIPS ARE SEALED ALL ARE ASLEEP IN THE HOUSE LET US PUT
HIM AWAY TOGETHER THAT WAS ENOUGH TO DECIDE MET IF MY OWN SERVANT
COULD NOT BELIEVE MY INNOCENCE HOW COULD I HOPE TO MAKE IT GOOD
BEFORE TWELVE FOOLISH TRADESMEN IN A JURYBOX LAL CHOWDAR AND I
DISPOSED OF THE BODY THAT NIGHT AND WITHIN A FEW DAYS THE LONDON
PAPERS WERE FULL OF THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF CAPTAIN MORSTAN
YOU WILL SEE FROM WHAT I SAY THAT I CAN HARDLY BE BLAMED IN THE
MATTER MY FAULT LIES IN THE FACT THAT WE CONCEALED NOT ONLY THE
BODY BUT ALSO THE TREASURE AND THAT I HAVE CLUNG TO MORSTANS SHARE
AS WELL AS TO MY OWN I WISH YOU THEREFORE TO MAKE RESTITUTION PUT
YOUR EARS DOWN TO MY MOUTH THE TREASURE IS HIDDEN INAT THIS
INSTANT A HORRIBLE CHANGE CAME OVER HIS EXPRESSION HIS EYES STARED
WILDLY HIS JAW DROPPED AND HE YELLED IN A VOICE WHICH I CAN NEVER
FORGET KEEP HIM OUT FOR CHRISTS SAKE KEEP HIM OUT WE BOTH
STARED ROUND AT THE WINDOW BEHIND US UPON WHICH HIS GAZE WAS FIXED A
FACE WAS LOOKING IN AT US OUT OF THE DARKNESS WE COULD SEE THE
WHITENING OF THE NOSE WHERE IT WAS PRESSED AGAINST THE GLASS IT WAS
A BEARDED HAIRY FACE WITH WILD CRUEL EYES AND AN EXPRESSION OF
CONCENTRATED MALEVOLENCE MY BROTHER AND I RUSHED TOWARDS THE WINDOW
BUT THE MAN WAS GONE WHEN WE RETURNED TO MY FATHER HIS HEAD HAD
DROPPED AND HIS PULSE HAD CEASED TO BEAT
WE SEARCHED THE GARDEN THAT NIGHT BUT FOUND NO SIGN OF THE
INTRUDER SAVE THAT JUST UNDER THE WINDOW A SINGLE FOOTMARK WAS
VISIBLE IN THE FLOWERBED BUT FOR THAT ONE TRACE WE MIGHT HAVE
THOUGHT THAT OUR IMAGINATIONS HAD CONJURED UP THAT WILD FIERCE FACE
WE SOON HOWEVER HAD ANOTHER AND A MORE STRIKING PROOF THAT THERE
WERE SECRET AGENCIES AT WORK ALL ROUND US THE WINDOW OF MY FATHERS
ROOM WAS FOUND OPEN IN THE MORNING HIS CUPBOARDS AND BOXES HAD BEEN
RIFLED AND UPON HIS CHEST WAS FIXED A TORN PIECE OF PAPER WITH THE
WORDS THE SIGN OF THE FOUR SCRAWLED ACROSS IT WHAT THE PHRASE
MEANT OR WHO OUR SECRET VISITOR MAY HAVE BEEN WE NEVER KNEW AS FAR
AS WE CAN JUDGE NONE OF MY FATHERS PROPERTY HAD BEEN ACTUALLY
STOLEN THOUGH EVERYTHING HAD BEEN TURNED OUT MY BROTHER AND I
NATURALLY ASSOCIATED THIS PECULIAR INCIDENT WITH THE FEAR WHICH
HAUNTED MY FATHER DURING HIS LIFE BUT IT IS STILL A COMPLETE MYSTERY
TO US
THE LITTLE MAN STOPPED TO RELIGHT HIS HOOKAH AND PUFFED THOUGHTFULLY
FOR A FEW MOMENTS WE HAD ALL SAT ABSORBED LISTENING TO HIS
EXTRAORDINARY NARRATIVE AT THE SHORT ACCOUNT OF HER FATHERS DEATH
MISS MORSTAN HAD TURNED DEADLY WHITE AND FOR A MOMENT I FEARED THAT
SHE WAS ABOUT TO FAINT SHE RALLIED HOWEVER ON DRINKING A GLASS OF
WATER WHICH I QUIETLY POURED OUT FOR HER FROM A VENETIAN CARAFE UPON
THE SIDETABLE SHERLOCK HOLMES LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH AN
ABSTRACTED EXPRESSION AND THE LIDS DRAWN LOW OVER HIS GLITTERING
EYES AS I GLANCED AT HIM I COULD NOT BUT THINK HOW ON THAT VERY DAY
HE HAD COMPLAINED BITTERLY OF THE COMMONPLACENESS OF LIFE HERE AT
LEAST WAS A PROBLEM WHICH WOULD TAX HIS SAGACITY TO THE UTMOST MR
THADDEUS SHOLTO LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US WITH AN OBVIOUS
PRIDE AT THE EFFECT WHICH HIS STORY HAD PRODUCED AND THEN CONTINUED
BETWEEN THE PUFFS OF HIS OVERGROWN PIPE
MY BROTHER AND I SAID HE WERE AS YOU MAY IMAGINE MUCH EXCITED
AS TO THE TREASURE WHICH MY FATHER HAD SPOKEN OF FOR WEEKS AND FOR
MONTHS WE DUG AND DELVED IN EVERY PART OF THE GARDEN WITHOUT
DISCOVERING ITS WHEREABOUTS IT WAS MADDENING TO THINK THAT THE
HIDINGPLACE WAS ON HIS VERY LIPS AT THE MOMENT THAT HE DIED WE
COULD JUDGE THE SPLENDOR OF THE MISSING RICHES BY THE CHAPLET WHICH
HE HAD TAKEN OUT OVER THIS CHAPLET MY BROTHER BARTHOLOMEW AND I HAD
SOME LITTLE DISCUSSION THE PEARLS WERE EVIDENTLY OF GREAT VALUE AND
HE WAS AVERSE TO PART WITH THEM FOR BETWEEN FRIENDS MY BROTHER WAS
HIMSELF A LITTLE INCLINED TO MY FATHERS FAULT HE THOUGHT TOO THAT
IF WE PARTED WITH THE CHAPLET IT MIGHT GIVE RISE TO GOSSIP AND
FINALLY BRING US INTO TROUBLE IT WAS ALL THAT I COULD DO TO PERSUADE
HIM TO LET ME FIND OUT MISS MORSTANS ADDRESS AND SEND HER A DETACHED
PEARL AT FIXED INTERVALS SO THAT AT LEAST SHE MIGHT NEVER FEEL
DESTITUTE
IT WAS A KINDLY THOUGHT SAID OUR COMPANION EARNESTLY IT WAS
EXTREMELY GOOD OF YOU
THE LITTLE MAN WAVED HIS HAND DEPRECATINGLY WE WERE YOUR TRUSTEES
HE SAID THAT WAS THE VIEW WHICH I TOOK OF IT THOUGH BROTHER
BARTHOLOMEW COULD NOT ALTOGETHER SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT WE HAD PLENTY
OF MONEY OURSELVES I DESIRED NO MORE BESIDES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
SUCH BAD TASTE TO HAVE TREATED A YOUNG LADY IN SO SCURVY A FASHION
LE MAUVAIS GOT MNE AU CRIME THE FRENCH HAVE A VERY NEAT WAY OF
PUTTING THESE THINGS OUR DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON THIS SUBJECT WENT
SO FAR THAT I THOUGHT IT BEST TO SET UP ROOMS FOR MYSELF SO I LEFT
PONDICHERRY LODGE TAKING THE OLD KHITMUTGAR AND WILLIAMS WITH ME
YESTERDAY HOWEVER I LEARN THAT AN EVENT OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE HAS
OCCURRED THE TREASURE HAS BEEN DISCOVERED I INSTANTLY COMMUNICATED
WITH MISS MORSTAN AND IT ONLY REMAINS FOR US TO DRIVE OUT TO NORWOOD
AND DEMAND OUR SHARE I EXPLAINED MY VIEWS LAST NIGHT TO BROTHER
BARTHOLOMEW SO WE SHALL BE EXPECTED IF NOT WELCOME VISITORS
MR THADDEUS SHOLTO CEASED AND SAT TWITCHING ON HIS LUXURIOUS
SETTEE WE ALL REMAINED SILENT WITH OUR THOUGHTS UPON THE NEW
DEVELOPMENT WHICH THE MYSTERIOUS BUSINESS HAD TAKEN HOLMES WAS THE
FIRST TO SPRING TO HIS FEET
YOU HAVE DONE WELL SIR FROM FIRST TO LAST SAID HE IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE YOU SOME SMALL RETURN BY
THROWING SOME LIGHT UPON THAT WHICH IS STILL DARK TO YOU BUT AS
MISS MORSTAN REMARKED JUST NOW IT IS LATE AND WE HAD BEST PUT THE
MATTER THROUGH WITHOUT DELAY
OUR NEW ACQUAINTANCE VERY DELIBERATELY COILED UP THE TUBE OF HIS
HOOKAH AND PRODUCED FROM BEHIND A CURTAIN A VERY LONG BEFROGGED
TOPCOAT WITH ASTRAKHAN COLLAR AND CUFFS THIS HE BUTTONED TIGHTLY UP
IN SPITE OF THE EXTREME CLOSENESS OF THE NIGHT AND FINISHED HIS
ATTIRE BY PUTTING ON A RABBITSKIN CAP WITH HANGING LAPPETS WHICH
COVERED THE EARS SO THAT NO PART OF HIM WAS VISIBLE SAVE HIS MOBILE
AND PEAKY FACE MY HEALTH IS SOMEWHAT FRAGILE HE REMARKED AS HE
LED THE WAY DOWN THE PASSAGE I AM COMPELLED TO BE A
VALETUDINARIAN
OUR CAB WAS AWAITING US OUTSIDE AND OUR PROGRAMME WAS EVIDENTLY
PREARRANGED FOR THE DRIVER STARTED OFF AT ONCE AT A RAPID PACE
THADDEUS SHOLTO TALKED INCESSANTLY IN A VOICE WHICH ROSE HIGH ABOVE
THE RATTLE OF THE WHEELS
BARTHOLOMEW IS A CLEVER FELLOW SAID HE HOW DO YOU THINK HE FOUND
OUT WHERE THE TREASURE WAS HE HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS
SOMEWHERE INDOORS SO HE WORKED OUT ALL THE CUBIC SPACE OF THE HOUSE
AND MADE MEASUREMENTS EVERYWHERE SO THAT NOT ONE INCH SHOULD BE
UNACCOUNTED FOR AMONG OTHER THINGS HE FOUND THAT THE HEIGHT OF THE
BUILDING WAS SEVENTYFOUR FEET BUT ON ADDING TOGETHER THE HEIGHTS OF
ALL THE SEPARATE ROOMS AND MAKING EVERY ALLOWANCE FOR THE SPACE
BETWEEN WHICH HE ASCERTAINED BY BORINGS HE COULD NOT BRING THE
TOTAL TO MORE THAN SEVENTY FEET THERE WERE FOUR FEET UNACCOUNTED
FOR THESE COULD ONLY BE AT THE TOP OF THE BUILDING HE KNOCKED A
HOLE THEREFORE IN THE LATHANDPLASTER CEILING OF THE HIGHEST ROOM
AND THERE SURE ENOUGH HE CAME UPON ANOTHER LITTLE GARRET ABOVE IT
WHICH HAD BEEN SEALED UP AND WAS KNOWN TO NO ONE IN THE CENTRE STOOD
THE TREASURECHEST RESTING UPON TWO RAFTERS HE LOWERED IT THROUGH
THE HOLE AND THERE IT LIES HE COMPUTES THE VALUE OF THE JEWELS AT
NOT LESS THAN HALF A MILLION STERLING
AT THE MENTION OF THIS GIGANTIC SUM WE ALL STARED AT ONE ANOTHER
OPENEYED MISS MORSTAN COULD WE SECURE HER RIGHTS WOULD CHANGE
FROM A NEEDY GOVERNESS TO THE RICHEST HEIRESS IN ENGLAND SURELY IT
WAS THE PLACE OF A LOYAL FRIEND TO REJOICE AT SUCH NEWS YET I AM
ASHAMED TO SAY THAT SELFISHNESS TOOK ME BY THE SOUL AND THAT MY
HEART TURNED AS HEAVY AS LEAD WITHIN ME I STAMMERED OUT SOME FEW
HALTING WORDS OF CONGRATULATION AND THEN SAT DOWNCAST WITH MY HEAD
DROOPED DEAF TO THE BABBLE OF OUR NEW ACQUAINTANCE HE WAS CLEARLY A
CONFIRMED HYPOCHONDRIAC AND I WAS DREAMILY CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS
POURING FORTH INTERMINABLE TRAINS OF SYMPTOMS AND IMPLORING
INFORMATION AS TO THE COMPOSITION AND ACTION OF INNUMERABLE QUACK
NOSTRUMS SOME OF WHICH HE BORE ABOUT IN A LEATHER CASE IN HIS
POCKET I TRUST THAT HE MAY NOT REMEMBER ANY OF THE ANSWERS WHICH I
GAVE HIM THAT NIGHT HOLMES DECLARES THAT HE OVERHEARD ME CAUTION HIM
AGAINST THE GREAT DANGER OF TAKING MORE THAN TWO DROPS OF CASTOR OIL
WHILE I RECOMMENDED STRYCHNINE IN LARGE DOSES AS A SEDATIVE HOWEVER
THAT MAY BE I WAS CERTAINLY RELIEVED WHEN OUR CAB PULLED UP WITH A
JERK AND THE COACHMAN SPRANG DOWN TO OPEN THE DOOR
THIS MISS MORSTAN IS PONDICHERRY LODGE SAID MR THADDEUS SHOLTO
AS HE HANDED HER OUT
CHAPTER V
THE TRAGEDY OF PONDICHERRY LODGE
IT WAS NEARLY ELEVEN OCLOCK WHEN WE REACHED THIS FINAL STAGE OF OUR
NIGHTS ADVENTURES WE HAD LEFT THE DAMP FOG OF THE GREAT CITY BEHIND
US AND THE NIGHT WAS FAIRLY FINE A WARM WIND BLEW FROM THE
WESTWARD AND HEAVY CLOUDS MOVED SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY WITH HALF A
MOON PEEPING OCCASIONALLY THROUGH THE RIFTS IT WAS CLEAR ENOUGH TO
SEE FOR SOME DISTANCE BUT THADDEUS SHOLTO TOOK DOWN ONE OF THE
SIDELAMPS FROM THE CARRIAGE TO GIVE US A BETTER LIGHT UPON OUR WAY
PONDICHERRY LODGE STOOD IN ITS OWN GROUNDS AND WAS GIRT ROUND WITH A
VERY HIGH STONE WALL TOPPED WITH BROKEN GLASS A SINGLE NARROW
IRONCLAMPED DOOR FORMED THE ONLY MEANS OF ENTRANCE ON THIS OUR
GUIDE KNOCKED WITH A PECULIAR POSTMANLIKE RATTAT
WHO IS THERE CRIED A GRUFF VOICE FROM WITHIN
IT IS I MCMURDO YOU SURELY KNOW MY KNOCK BY THIS TIME
THERE WAS A GRUMBLING SOUND AND A CLANKING AND JARRING OF KEYS THE
DOOR SWUNG HEAVILY BACK AND A SHORT DEEPCHESTED MAN STOOD IN THE
OPENING WITH THE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE LANTERN SHINING UPON HIS
PROTRUDED FACE AND TWINKLING DISTRUSTFUL EYES

IN YOU COME SIR IN YOU COMEYOU AND YOUR FRIENDS HE ANSWERED
VERY SORRY MR THADDEUS BUT ORDERS ARE VERY STRICT HAD TO BE
CERTAIN OF YOUR FRIENDS BEFORE I LET THEM IN
INSIDE A GRAVEL PATH WOUND THROUGH DESOLATE GROUNDS TO A HUGE CLUMP
OF A HOUSE SQUARE AND PROSAIC ALL PLUNGED IN SHADOW SAVE WHERE A
MOONBEAM STRUCK ONE CORNER AND GLIMMERED IN A GARRET WINDOW THE VAST
SIZE OF THE BUILDING WITH ITS GLOOM AND ITS DEATHLY SILENCE STRUCK
A CHILL TO THE HEART EVEN THADDEUS SHOLTO SEEMED ILL AT EASE AND
THE LANTERN QUIVERED AND RATTLED IN HIS HAND
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT HE SAID THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE I
DISTINCTLY TOLD BARTHOLOMEW THAT WE SHOULD BE HERE AND YET THERE IS
NO LIGHT IN HIS WINDOW I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT
DOES HE ALWAYS GUARD THE PREMISES IN THIS WAY ASKED HOLMES
YES HE HAS FOLLOWED MY FATHERS CUSTOM HE WAS THE FAVORITE SON
YOU KNOW AND I SOMETIMES THINK THAT MY FATHER MAY HAVE TOLD HIM MORE
THAN HE EVER TOLD ME THAT IS BARTHOLOMEWS WINDOW UP THERE WHERE THE
MOONSHINE STRIKES IT IS QUITE BRIGHT BUT THERE IS NO LIGHT FROM
WITHIN I THINK
NONE SAID HOLMES BUT I SEE THE GLINT OF A LIGHT IN THAT LITTLE
WINDOW BESIDE THE DOOR
AH THAT IS THE HOUSEKEEPERS ROOM THAT IS WHERE OLD MRS BERNSTONE
SITS SHE CAN TELL US ALL ABOUT IT BUT PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT MIND
WAITING HERE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO FOR IF WE ALL GO IN TOGETHER AND
SHE HAS NO WORD OF OUR COMING SHE MAY BE ALARMED BUT HUSH WHAT IS
THAT
HE HELD UP THE LANTERN AND HIS HAND SHOOK UNTIL THE CIRCLES OF LIGHT
FLICKERED AND WAVERED ALL ROUND US MISS MORSTAN SEIZED MY WRIST AND
WE ALL STOOD WITH THUMPING HEARTS STRAINING OUR EARS FROM THE GREAT
BLACK HOUSE THERE SOUNDED THROUGH THE SILENT NIGHT THE SADDEST AND
MOST PITIFUL OF SOUNDSTHE SHRILL BROKEN WHIMPERING OF A
FRIGHTENED WOMAN
IT IS MRS BERNSTONE SAID SHOLTO SHE IS THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE
HOUSE WAIT HERE I SHALL BE BACK IN A MOMENT HE HURRIED FOR THE
DOOR AND KNOCKED IN HIS PECULIAR WAY WE COULD SEE A TALL OLD WOMAN
ADMIT HIM AND SWAY WITH PLEASURE AT THE VERY SIGHT OF HIM
OH MR THADDEUS SIR I AM SO GLAD YOU HAVE COME I AM SO GLAD YOU
HAVE COME MR THADDEUS SIR WE HEARD HER REITERATED REJOICINGS
UNTIL THE DOOR WAS CLOSED AND HER VOICE DIED AWAY INTO A MUFFLED
MONOTONE
OUR GUIDE HAD LEFT US THE LANTERN HOLMES SWUNG IT SLOWLY ROUND AND
PEERED KEENLY AT THE HOUSE AND AT THE GREAT RUBBISHHEAPS WHICH
CUMBERED THE GROUNDS MISS MORSTAN AND I STOOD TOGETHER AND HER HAND
WAS IN MINE A WONDROUS SUBTLE THING IS LOVE FOR HERE WERE WE TWO
WHO HAD NEVER SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE THAT DAY BETWEEN WHOM NO WORD
OR EVEN LOOK OF AFFECTION HAD EVER PASSED AND YET NOW IN AN HOUR OF
TROUBLE OUR HANDS INSTINCTIVELY SOUGHT FOR EACH OTHER I HAVE
MARVELLED AT IT SINCE BUT AT THE TIME IT SEEMED THE MOST NATURAL
THING THAT I SHOULD GO OUT TO HER SO AND AS SHE HAS OFTEN TOLD ME
THERE WAS IN HER ALSO THE INSTINCT TO TURN TO ME FOR COMFORT AND
PROTECTION SO WE STOOD HAND IN HAND LIKE TWO CHILDREN AND THERE
WAS PEACE IN OUR HEARTS FOR ALL THE DARK THINGS THAT SURROUNDED US
WHAT A STRANGE PLACE SHE SAID LOOKING ROUND
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH ALL THE MOLES IN ENGLAND HAD BEEN LET LOOSE IN
IT I HAVE SEEN SOMETHING OF THE SORT ON THE SIDE OF A HILL NEAR
BALLARAT WHERE THE PROSPECTORS HAD BEEN AT WORK
AND FROM THE SAME CAUSE SAID HOLMES THESE ARE THE TRACES OF THE
TREASURESEEKERS YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY WERE SIX YEARS LOOKING
FOR IT NO WONDER THAT THE GROUNDS LOOK LIKE A GRAVELPIT
AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE BURST OPEN AND THADDEUS SHOLTO
CAME RUNNING OUT WITH HIS HANDS THROWN FORWARD AND TERROR IN HIS
EYES
THERE IS SOMETHING AMISS WITH BARTHOLOMEW HE CRIED I AM
FRIGHTENED MY NERVES CANNOT STAND IT HE WAS INDEED HALF
BLUBBERING WITH FEAR AND HIS TWITCHING FEEBLE FACE PEEPING OUT FROM
THE GREAT ASTRAKHAN COLLAR HAD THE HELPLESS APPEALING EXPRESSION OF A
TERRIFIED CHILD
COME INTO THE HOUSE SAID HOLMES IN HIS CRISP FIRM WAY
YES DO PLEADED THADDEUS SHOLTO I REALLY DO NOT FEEL EQUAL TO
GIVING DIRECTIONS
WE ALL FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE HOUSEKEEPERS ROOM WHICH STOOD UPON THE
LEFTHAND SIDE OF THE PASSAGE THE OLD WOMAN WAS PACING UP AND DOWN
WITH A SCARED LOOK AND RESTLESS PICKING FINGERS BUT THE SIGHT OF
MISS MORSTAN APPEARED TO HAVE A SOOTHING EFFECT UPON HER
GOD BLESS YOUR SWEET CALM FACE SHE CRIED WITH AN HYSTERICAL SOB
IT DOES ME GOOD TO SEE YOU OH BUT I HAVE BEEN SORELY TRIED THIS
DAY
OUR COMPANION PATTED HER THIN WORKWORN HAND AND MURMURED SOME FEW
WORDS OF KINDLY WOMANLY COMFORT WHICH BROUGHT THE COLOR BACK INTO THE
OTHERS BLOODLESS CHEEKS
MASTER HAS LOCKED HIMSELF IN AND WILL NOW ANSWER ME SHE EXPLAINED
ALL DAY I HAVE WAITED TO HEAR FROM HIM FOR HE OFTEN LIKES TO BE
ALONE BUT AN HOUR AGO I FEARED THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS SO I WENT
UP AND PEEPED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE YOU MUST GO UP MR
THADDEUSYOU MUST GO UP AND LOOK FOR YOURSELF I HAVE SEEN MR
BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTO IN JOY AND IN SORROW FOR TEN LONG YEARS BUT I
NEVER SAW HIM WITH SUCH A FACE ON HIM AS THAT
SHERLOCK HOLMES TOOK THE LAMP AND LED THE WAY FOR THADDEUS SHOLTOS
TEETH WERE CHATTERING IN HIS HEAD SO SHAKEN WAS HE THAT I HAD TO
PASS MY HAND UNDER HIS ARM AS WE WENT UP THE STAIRS FOR HIS KNEES
WERE TREMBLING UNDER HIM TWICE AS WE ASCENDED HOLMES WHIPPED HIS
LENS OUT OF HIS POCKET AND CAREFULLY EXAMINED MARKS WHICH APPEARED TO
ME TO BE MERE SHAPELESS SMUDGES OF DUST UPON THE COCOANUT MATTING
WHICH SERVED AS A STAIRCARPET HE WALKED SLOWLY FROM STEP TO STEP
HOLDING THE LAMP AND SHOOTING KEEN GLANCES TO RIGHT AND LEFT MISS
MORSTAN HAD REMAINED BEHIND WITH THE FRIGHTENED HOUSEKEEPER
THE THIRD FLIGHT OF STAIRS ENDED IN A STRAIGHT PASSAGE OF SOME
LENGTH WITH A GREAT PICTURE IN INDIAN TAPESTRY UPON THE RIGHT OF IT
AND THREE DOORS UPON THE LEFT HOLMES ADVANCED ALONG IT IN THE SAME
SLOW AND METHODICAL WAY WHILE WE KEPT CLOSE AT HIS HEELS WITH OUR
LONG BLACK SHADOWS STREAMING BACKWARDS DOWN THE CORRIDOR THE THIRD
DOOR WAS THAT WHICH WE WERE SEEKING HOLMES KNOCKED WITHOUT RECEIVING
ANY ANSWER AND THEN TRIED TO TURN THE HANDLE AND FORCE IT OPEN IT
WAS LOCKED ON THE INSIDE HOWEVER AND BY A BROAD AND POWERFUL BOLT
AS WE COULD SEE WHEN WE SET OUR LAMP UP AGAINST IT THE KEY BEING
TURNED HOWEVER THE HOLE WAS NOT ENTIRELY CLOSED SHERLOCK HOLMES
BENT DOWN TO IT AND INSTANTLY ROSE AGAIN WITH A SHARP INTAKING OF
THE BREATH
THERE IS SOMETHING DEVILISH IN THIS WATSON SAID HE MORE MOVED
THAN I HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN HIM WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
I STOOPED TO THE HOLE AND RECOILED IN HORROR MOONLIGHT WAS
STREAMING INTO THE ROOM AND IT WAS BRIGHT WITH A VAGUE AND SHIFTY
RADIANCE LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME AND SUSPENDED AS IT WERE IN THE
AIR FOR ALL BENEATH WAS IN SHADOW THERE HUNG A FACETHE VERY FACE
OF OUR COMPANION THADDEUS THERE WAS THE SAME HIGH SHINING HEAD THE
SAME CIRCULAR BRISTLE OF RED HAIR THE SAME BLOODLESS COUNTENANCE
THE FEATURES WERE SET HOWEVER IN A HORRIBLE SMILE A FIXED AND
UNNATURAL GRIN WHICH IN THAT STILL AND MOONLIT ROOM WAS MORE JARRING
TO THE NERVES THAN ANY SCOWL OR CONTORTION SO LIKE WAS THE FACE TO
THAT OF OUR LITTLE FRIEND THAT I LOOKED ROUND AT HIM TO MAKE SURE
THAT HE WAS INDEED WITH US THEN I RECALLED TO MIND THAT HE HAD
MENTIONED TO US THAT HIS BROTHER AND HE WERE TWINS
THIS IS TERRIBLE I SAID TO HOLMES WHAT IS TO BE DONE
THE DOOR MUST COME DOWN HE ANSWERED AND SPRINGING AGAINST IT HE
PUT ALL HIS WEIGHT UPON THE LOCK IT CREAKED AND GROANED BUT DID NOT
YIELD TOGETHER WE FLUNG OURSELVES UPON IT ONCE MORE AND THIS TIME
IT GAVE WAY WITH A SUDDEN SNAP AND WE FOUND OURSELVES WITHIN
BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTOS CHAMBER
IT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN FITTED UP AS A CHEMICAL LABORATORY A DOUBLE
LINE OF GLASSSTOPPERED BOTTLES WAS DRAWN UP UPON THE WALL OPPOSITE
THE DOOR AND THE TABLE WAS LITTERED OVER WITH BUNSEN BURNERS
TESTTUBES AND RETORTS IN THE CORNERS STOOD CARBOYS OF ACID IN
WICKER BASKETS ONE OF THESE APPEARED TO LEAK OR TO HAVE BEEN BROKEN
FOR A STREAM OF DARKCOLORED LIQUID HAD TRICKLED OUT FROM IT AND THE
AIR WAS HEAVY WITH A PECULIARLY PUNGENT TARLIKE ODOR A SET OF
STEPS STOOD AT ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM IN THE MIDST OF A LITTER OF LATH
AND PLASTER AND ABOVE THEM THERE WAS AN OPENING IN THE CEILING LARGE
ENOUGH FOR A MAN TO PASS THROUGH AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS A LONG
COIL OF ROPE WAS THROWN CARELESSLY TOGETHER
BY THE TABLE IN A WOODEN ARMCHAIR THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS
SEATED ALL IN A HEAP WITH HIS HEAD SUNK UPON HIS LEFT SHOULDER AND
THAT GHASTLY INSCRUTABLE SMILE UPON HIS FACE HE WAS STIFF AND COLD
AND HAD CLEARLY BEEN DEAD MANY HOURS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT NOT ONLY
HIS FEATURES BUT ALL HIS LIMBS WERE TWISTED AND TURNED IN THE MOST
FANTASTIC FASHION BY HIS HAND UPON THE TABLE THERE LAY A PECULIAR
INSTRUMENTA BROWN CLOSEGRAINED STICK WITH A STONE HEAD LIKE A
HAMMER RUDELY LASHED ON WITH COARSE TWINE BESIDE IT WAS A TORN
SHEET OF NOTEPAPER WITH SOME WORDS SCRAWLED UPON IT HOLMES GLANCED
AT IT AND THEN HANDED IT TO ME
YOU SEE HE SAID WITH A SIGNIFICANT RAISING OF THE EYEBROWS
IN THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN I READ WITH A THRILL OF HORROR THE
SIGN OF THE FOUR
IN GODS NAME WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN I ASKED
IT MEANS MURDER SAID HE STOOPING OVER THE DEAD MAN AH I
EXPECTED IT LOOK HERE HE POINTED TO WHAT LOOKED LIKE A LONG DARK
THORN STUCK IN THE SKIN JUST ABOVE THE EAR
IT LOOKS LIKE A THORN SAID I
IT IS A THORN YOU MAY PICK IT OUT BUT BE CAREFUL FOR IT IS
POISONED
I TOOK IT UP BETWEEN MY FINGER AND THUMB IT CAME AWAY FROM THE SKIN
SO READILY THAT HARDLY ANY MARK WAS LEFT BEHIND ONE TINY SPECK OF
BLOOD SHOWED WHERE THE PUNCTURE HAD BEEN
THIS IS ALL AN INSOLUBLE MYSTERY TO ME SAID I IT GROWS DARKER
INSTEAD OF CLEARER
ON THE CONTRARY HE ANSWERED IT CLEARS EVERY INSTANT I ONLY
REQUIRE A FEW MISSING LINKS TO HAVE AN ENTIRELY CONNECTED CASE
WE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN OUR COMPANIONS PRESENCE SINCE WE ENTERED THE
CHAMBER HE WAS STILL STANDING IN THE DOORWAY THE VERY PICTURE OF
TERROR WRINGING HIS HANDS AND MOANING TO HIMSELF SUDDENLY HOWEVER
HE BROKE OUT INTO A SHARP QUERULOUS CRY
THE TREASURE IS GONE HE SAID THEY HAVE ROBBED HIM OF THE
TREASURE THERE IS THE HOLE THROUGH WHICH WE LOWERED IT I HELPED HIM
TO DO IT I WAS THE LAST PERSON WHO SAW HIM I LEFT HIM HERE LAST
NIGHT AND I HEARD HIM LOCK THE DOOR AS I CAME DOWNSTAIRS
WHAT TIME WAS THAT
IT WAS TEN OCLOCK AND NOW HE IS DEAD AND THE POLICE WILL BE
CALLED IN AND I SHALL BE SUSPECTED OF HAVING HAD A HAND IN IT OH
YES I AM SURE I SHALL BUT YOU DONT THINK SO GENTLEMEN SURELY YOU
DONT THINK THAT IT WAS I IS IT LIKELY THAT I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT YOU
HERE IF IT WERE I OH DEAR OH DEAR I KNOW THAT I SHALL GO MAD
HE JERKED HIS ARMS AND STAMPED HIS FEET IN A KIND OF CONVULSIVE
FRENZY
YOU HAVE NO REASON FOR FEAR MR SHOLTO SAID HOLMES KINDLY
PUTTING HIS HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER TAKE MY ADVICE AND DRIVE DOWN
TO THE STATION TO REPORT THIS MATTER TO THE POLICE OFFER TO ASSIST
THEM IN EVERY WAY WE SHALL WAIT HERE UNTIL YOUR RETURN
THE LITTLE MAN OBEYED IN A HALFSTUPEFIED FASHION AND WE HEARD HIM
STUMBLING DOWN THE STAIRS IN THE DARK
CHAPTER VI
SHERLOCK HOLMES GIVES A DEMONSTRATION
NOW WATSON SAID HOLMES RUBBING HIS HANDS WE HAVE HALF AN HOUR
TO OURSELVES LET US MAKE GOOD USE OF IT MY CASE IS AS I HAVE TOLD
YOU ALMOST COMPLETE BUT WE MUST NOT ERR ON THE SIDE OF
OVERCONFIDENCE SIMPLE AS THE CASE SEEMS NOW THERE MAY BE SOMETHING
DEEPER UNDERLYING IT
SIMPLE I EJACULATED
SURELY SAID HE WITH SOMETHING OF THE AIR OF A CLINICAL PROFESSOR
EXPOUNDING TO HIS CLASS JUST SIT IN THE CORNER THERE THAT YOUR
FOOTPRINTS MAY NOT COMPLICATE MATTERS NOW TO WORK IN THE FIRST
PLACE HOW DID THESE FOLK COME AND HOW DID THEY GO THE DOOR HAS NOT
BEEN OPENED SINCE LAST NIGHT HOW OF THE WINDOW HE CARRIED THE LAMP
ACROSS TO IT MUTTERING HIS OBSERVATIONS ALOUD THE WHILE BUT
ADDRESSING THEM TO HIMSELF RATHER THAN TO ME WINDOW IS SNIBBED ON
THE INNER SIDE FRAMEWORK IS SOLID NO HINGES AT THE SIDE LET US
OPEN IT NO WATERPIPE NEAR ROOF QUITE OUT OF REACH YET A MAN HAS
MOUNTED BY THE WINDOW IT RAINED A LITTLE LAST NIGHT HERE IS THE
PRINT OF A FOOT IN MOULD UPON THE SILL AND HERE IS A CIRCULAR MUDDY
MARK AND HERE AGAIN UPON THE FLOOR AND HERE AGAIN BY THE TABLE SEE
HERE WATSON THIS IS REALLY A VERY PRETTY DEMONSTRATION
I LOOKED AT THE ROUND WELLDEFINED MUDDY DISCS THIS IS NOT A
FOOTMARK SAID I
IT IS SOMETHING MUCH MORE VALUABLE TO US IT IS THE IMPRESSION OF A
WOODEN STUMP YOU SEE HERE ON THE SILL IS THE BOOTMARK A HEAVY BOOT
WITH THE BROAD METAL HEEL AND BESIDE IT IS THE MARK OF THE
TIMBERTOE
IT IS THE WOODENLEGGED MAN
QUITE SO BUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME ONE ELSEA VERY ABLE AND
EFFICIENT ALLY COULD YOU SCALE THAT WALL DOCTOR
I LOOKED OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW THE MOON STILL SHONE BRIGHTLY ON
THAT ANGLE OF THE HOUSE WE WERE A GOOD SIXTY FEET FROM THE GROUND
AND LOOK WHERE I WOULD I COULD SEE NO FOOTHOLD NOR AS MUCH AS A
CREVICE IN THE BRICKWORK
IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE I ANSWERED
WITHOUT AID IT IS SO BUT SUPPOSE YOU HAD A FRIEND UP HERE WHO
LOWERED YOU THIS GOOD STOUT ROPE WHICH I SEE IN THE CORNER SECURING
ONE END OF IT TO THIS GREAT HOOK IN THE WALL THEN I THINK IF YOU
WERE AN ACTIVE MAN YOU MIGHT SWARM UP WOODEN LEG AND ALL YOU WOULD
DEPART OF COURSE IN THE SAME FASHION AND YOUR ALLY WOULD DRAW UP
THE ROPE UNTIE IT FROM THE HOOK SHUT THE WINDOW SNIB IT ON THE
INSIDE AND GET AWAY IN THE WAY THAT HE ORIGINALLY CAME AS A MINOR
POINT IT MAY BE NOTED HE CONTINUED FINGERING THE ROPE THAT OUR
WOODENLEGGED FRIEND THOUGH A FAIR CLIMBER WAS NOT A PROFESSIONAL
SAILOR HIS HANDS WERE FAR FROM HORNY MY LENS DISCLOSES MORE THAN
ONE BLOODMARK ESPECIALLY TOWARDS THE END OF THE ROPE FROM WHICH I
GATHER THAT HE SLIPPED DOWN WITH SUCH VELOCITY THAT HE TOOK THE SKIN
OFF HIS HAND
THIS IS ALL VERY WELL SAID I BUT THE THING BECOMES MORE
UNINTELLIGIBLE THAN EVER HOW ABOUT THIS MYSTERIOUS ALLY HOW CAME HE
INTO THE ROOM
YES THE ALLY REPEATED HOLMES PENSIVELY THERE ARE FEATURES OF
INTEREST ABOUT THIS ALLY HE LIFTS THE CASE FROM THE REGIONS OF THE
COMMONPLACE I FANCY THAT THIS ALLY BREAKS FRESH GROUND IN THE ANNALS
OF CRIME IN THIS COUNTRYTHOUGH PARALLEL CASES SUGGEST THEMSELVES
FROM INDIA AND IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME FROM SENEGAMBIA
HOW CAME HE THEN I REITERATED THE DOOR IS LOCKED THE WINDOW IS
INACCESSIBLE WAS IT THROUGH THE CHIMNEY
THE GRATE IS MUCH TOO SMALL HE ANSWERED I HAD ALREADY CONSIDERED
THAT POSSIBILITY
HOW THEN I PERSISTED
YOU WILL NOT APPLY MY PRECEPT HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD HOW
OFTEN HAVE I SAID TO YOU THAT WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE
WHATEVER REMAINS HOWEVER IMPROBABLE MUST BE THE TRUTH WE KNOW THAT
HE DID NOT COME THROUGH THE DOOR THE WINDOW OR THE CHIMNEY WE ALSO
KNOW THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONCEALED IN THE ROOM AS THERE IS
NO CONCEALMENT POSSIBLE WHENCE THEN DID HE COME
HE CAME THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ROOF I CRIED
OF COURSE HE DID HE MUST HAVE DONE SO IF YOU WILL HAVE THE
KINDNESS TO HOLD THE LAMP FOR ME WE SHALL NOW EXTEND OUR RESEARCHES
TO THE ROOM ABOVETHE SECRET ROOM IN WHICH THE TREASURE WAS FOUND
HE MOUNTED THE STEPS AND SEIZING A RAFTER WITH EITHER HAND HE
SWUNG HIMSELF UP INTO THE GARRET THEN LYING ON HIS FACE HE REACHED
DOWN FOR THE LAMP AND HELD IT WHILE I FOLLOWED HIM
THE CHAMBER IN WHICH WE FOUND OURSELVES WAS ABOUT TEN FEET ONE WAY
AND SIX THE OTHER THE FLOOR WAS FORMED BY THE RAFTERS WITH THIN
LATHANDPLASTER BETWEEN SO THAT IN WALKING ONE HAD TO STEP FROM
BEAM TO BEAM THE ROOF RAN UP TO AN APEX AND WAS EVIDENTLY THE INNER
SHELL OF THE TRUE ROOF OF THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO FURNITURE OF ANY
SORT AND THE ACCUMULATED DUST OF YEARS LAY THICK UPON THE FLOOR
HERE YOU ARE YOU SEE SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES PUTTING HIS HAND
AGAINST THE SLOPING WALL THIS IS A TRAPDOOR WHICH LEADS OUT ON TO
THE ROOF I CAN PRESS IT BACK AND HERE IS THE ROOF ITSELF SLOPING
AT A GENTLE ANGLE THIS THEN IS THE WAY BY WHICH NUMBER ONE
ENTERED LET US SEE IF WE CAN FIND ONE OTHER TRACES OF HIS
INDIVIDUALITY
HE HELD DOWN THE LAMP TO THE FLOOR AND AS HE DID SO I SAW FOR THE
SECOND TIME THAT NIGHT A STARTLED SURPRISED LOOK COME OVER HIS FACE
FOR MYSELF AS I FOLLOWED HIS GAZE MY SKIN WAS COLD UNDER MY CLOTHES
THE FLOOR WAS COVERED THICKLY WITH THE PRINTS OF A NAKED
FOOTCLEAR WELL DEFINED PERFECTLY FORMED BUT SCARCE HALF THE
SIZE OF THOSE OF AN ORDINARY MAN
HOLMES I SAID IN A WHISPER A CHILD HAS DONE THE HORRID THING
HE HAD RECOVERED HIS SELFPOSSESSION IN AN INSTANT I WAS STAGGERED
FOR THE MOMENT HE SAID BUT THE THING IS QUITE NATURAL MY MEMORY
FAILED ME OR I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORETELL IT THERE IS
NOTHING MORE TO BE LEARNED HERE LET US GO DOWN
WHAT IS YOUR THEORY THEN AS TO THOSE FOOTMARKS I ASKED EAGERLY
WHEN WE HAD REGAINED THE LOWER ROOM ONCE MORE
MY DEAR WATSON TRY A LITTLE ANALYSIS YOURSELF SAID HE WITH A
TOUCH OF IMPATIENCE YOU KNOW MY METHODS APPLY THEM AND IT WILL BE
INSTRUCTIVE TO COMPARE RESULTS
I CANNOT CONCEIVE ANYTHING WHICH WILL COVER THE FACTS I ANSWERED
IT WILL BE CLEAR ENOUGH TO YOU SOON HE SAID IN AN OFFHAND WAY
I THINK THAT THERE IS NOTHING ELSE OF IMPORTANCE HERE BUT I WILL
LOOK HE WHIPPED OUT HIS LENS AND A TAPE MEASURE AND HURRIED ABOUT
THE ROOM ON HIS KNEES MEASURING COMPARING EXAMINING WITH HIS LONG
THIN NOSE ONLY A FEW INCHES FROM THE PLANKS AND HIS BEADY EYES
GLEAMING AND DEEPSET LIKE THOSE OF A BIRD SO SWIFT SILENT AND
FURTIVE WERE HIS MOVEMENTS LIKE THOSE OF A TRAINED BLOODHOUND
PICKING OUT A SCENT THAT I COULD NOT BUT THINK WHAT A TERRIBLE
CRIMINAL HE WOULD HAVE MADE HAD HE TURNED HIS ENERGY AND SAGACITY
AGAINST THE LAW INSTEAD OF EXERTING THEM IN ITS DEFENSE AS HE
HUNTED ABOUT HE KEPT MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND FINALLY HE BROKE OUT
INTO A LOUD CROW OF DELIGHT
WE ARE CERTAINLY IN LUCK SAID HE WE OUGHT TO HAVE VERY LITTLE
TROUBLE NOW NUMBER ONE HAS HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO TREAD IN THE
CREOSOTE YOU CAN SEE THE OUTLINE OF THE EDGE OF HIS SMALL FOOT HERE
AT THE SIDE OF THIS EVILSMELLING MESS THE CARBOY HAS BEEN CRACKED
YOU SEE AND THE STUFF HAS LEAKED OUT
WHAT THEN I ASKED
WHY WE HAVE GOT HIM THATS ALL SAID HE I KNOW A DOG THAT WOULD
FOLLOW THAT SCENT TO THE WORLDS END IF A PACK CAN TRACK A TRAILED
HERRING ACROSS A SHIRE HOW FAR CAN A SPECIALLYTRAINED HOUND FOLLOW
SO PUNGENT A SMELL AS THIS IT SOUNDS LIKE A SUM IN THE RULE OF
THREE THE ANSWER SHOULD GIVE US THEBUT HALLOO HERE ARE THE
ACCREDITED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LAW
HEAVY STEPS AND THE CLAMOR OF LOUD VOICES WERE AUDIBLE FROM BELOW
AND THE HALL DOOR SHUT WITH A LOUD CRASH
BEFORE THEY COME SAID HOLMES JUST PUT YOUR HAND HERE ON THIS
POOR FELLOWS ARM AND HERE ON HIS LEG WHAT DO YOU FEEL
THE MUSCLES ARE AS HARD AS A BOARD I ANSWERED
QUITE SO THEY ARE IN A STATE OF EXTREME CONTRACTION FAR EXCEEDING
THE USUAL RIGOR MORTIS COUPLED WITH THIS DISTORTION OF THE FACE
THIS HIPPOCRATIC SMILE OR RISUS SARDONICUS AS THE OLD WRITERS
CALLED IT WHAT CONCLUSION WOULD IT SUGGEST TO YOUR MIND
DEATH FROM SOME POWERFUL VEGETABLE ALKALOID I ANSWEREDSOME
STRYCHNINELIKE SUBSTANCE WHICH WOULD PRODUCE TETANUS
THAT WAS THE IDEA WHICH OCCURRED TO ME THE INSTANT I SAW THE DRAWN
MUSCLES OF THE FACE ON GETTING INTO THE ROOM I AT ONCE LOOKED FOR
THE MEANS BY WHICH THE POISON HAD ENTERED THE SYSTEM AS YOU SAW I
DISCOVERED A THORN WHICH HAD BEEN DRIVEN OR SHOT WITH NO GREAT FORCE
INTO THE SCALP YOU OBSERVE THAT THE PART STRUCK WAS THAT WHICH WOULD
BE TURNED TOWARDS THE HOLE IN THE CEILING IF THE MAN WERE ERECT IN
HIS CHAIR NOW EXAMINE THE THORN
I TOOK IT UP GINGERLY AND HELD IT IN THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN IT WAS
LONG SHARP AND BLACK WITH A GLAZED LOOK NEAR THE POINT AS THOUGH
SOME GUMMY SUBSTANCE HAD DRIED UPON IT THE BLUNT END HAD BEEN
TRIMMED AND ROUNDED OFF WITH A KNIFE
IS THAT AN ENGLISH THORN HE ASKED
NO IT CERTAINLY IS NOT
WITH ALL THESE DATA YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRAW SOME JUST INFERENCE
BUT HERE ARE THE REGULARS SO THE AUXILIARY FORCES MAY BEAT A
RETREAT
AS HE SPOKE THE STEPS WHICH HAD BEEN COMING NEARER SOUNDED LOUDLY ON
THE PASSAGE AND A VERY STOUT PORTLY MAN IN A GRAY SUIT STRODE
HEAVILY INTO THE ROOM HE WAS REDFACED BURLY AND PLETHORIC WITH A
PAIR OF VERY SMALL TWINKLING EYES WHICH LOOKED KEENLY OUT FROM
BETWEEN SWOLLEN AND PUFFY POUCHES HE WAS CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY AN
INSPECTOR IN UNIFORM AND BY THE STILL PALPITATING THADDEUS SHOLTO
HERES A BUSINESS HE CRIED IN A MUFFLED HUSKY VOICE HERES A
PRETTY BUSINESS BUT WHO ARE ALL THESE WHY THE HOUSE SEEMS TO BE AS
FULL AS A RABBITWARREN
I THINK YOU MUST RECOLLECT ME MR ATHELNEY JONES SAID HOLMES
QUIETLY
WHY OF COURSE I DO HE WHEEZED ITS MR SHERLOCK HOLMES THE
THEORIST REMEMBER YOU ILL NEVER FORGET HOW YOU LECTURED US ALL ON
CAUSES AND INFERENCES AND EFFECTS IN THE BISHOPGATE JEWEL CASE ITS
TRUE YOU SET US ON THE RIGHT TRACK BUT YOULL OWN NOW THAT IT WAS
MORE BY GOOD LUCK THAN GOOD GUIDANCE
IT WAS A PIECE OF VERY SIMPLE REASONING
OH COME NOW COME NEVER BE ASHAMED TO OWN UP BUT WHAT IS ALL
THIS BAD BUSINESS BAD BUSINESS STERN FACTS HERENO ROOM FOR
THEORIES HOW LUCKY THAT I HAPPENED TO BE OUT AT NORWOOD OVER ANOTHER
CASE I WAS AT THE STATION WHEN THE MESSAGE ARRIVED WHAT DYOU THINK
THE MAN DIED OF
OH THIS IS HARDLY A CASE FOR ME TO THEORIZE OVER SAID HOLMES
DRYLY
NO NO STILL WE CANT DENY THAT YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD
SOMETIMES DEAR ME DOOR LOCKED I UNDERSTAND JEWELS WORTH HALF A
MILLION MISSING HOW WAS THE WINDOW
FASTENED BUT THERE ARE STEPS ON THE SILL
WELL WELL IF IT WAS FASTENED THE STEPS COULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE MATTER THATS COMMON SENSE MAN MIGHT HAVE DIED IN A FIT
BUT THEN THE JEWELS ARE MISSING HA I HAVE A THEORY THESE FLASHES
COME UPON ME AT TIMESJUST STEP OUTSIDE SERGEANT AND YOU MR
SHOLTO YOUR FRIEND CAN REMAINWHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS HOLMES
SHOLTO WAS ON HIS OWN CONFESSION WITH HIS BROTHER LAST NIGHT THE
BROTHER DIED IN A FIT ON WHICH SHOLTO WALKED OFF WITH THE TREASURE
HOWS THAT
ON WHICH THE DEAD MAN VERY CONSIDERATELY GOT UP AND LOCKED THE DOOR
ON THE INSIDE
HUM THERES A FLAW THERE LET US APPLY COMMON SENSE TO THE MATTER
THIS THADDEUS SHOLTO WAS WITH HIS BROTHER THERE WAS A QUARREL SO
MUCH WE KNOW THE BROTHER IS DEAD AND THE JEWELS ARE GONE SO MUCH
ALSO WE KNOW NO ONE SAW THE BROTHER FROM THE TIME THADDEUS LEFT HIM
HIS BED HAD NOT BEEN SLEPT IN THADDEUS IS EVIDENTLY IN A MOST
DISTURBED STATE OF MIND HIS APPEARANCE ISWELL NOT ATTRACTIVE YOU
SEE THAT I AM WEAVING MY WEB ROUND THADDEUS THE NET BEGINS TO CLOSE
UPON HIM
YOU ARE NOT QUITE IN POSSESSION OF THE FACTS YET SAID HOLMES
THIS SPLINTER OF WOOD WHICH I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE TO BE
POISONED WAS IN THE MANS SCALP WHERE YOU STILL SEE THE MARK THIS
CARD INSCRIBED AS YOU SEE IT WAS ON THE TABLE AND BESIDE IT LAY
THIS RATHER CURIOUS STONEHEADED INSTRUMENT HOW DOES ALL THAT FIT
INTO YOUR THEORY
CONFIRMS IT IN EVERY RESPECT SAID THE FAT DETECTIVE POMPOUSLY
HOUSE IS FULL OF INDIAN CURIOSITIES THADDEUS BROUGHT THIS UP AND
IF THIS SPLINTER BE POISONOUS THADDEUS MAY AS WELL HAVE MADE
MURDEROUS USE OF IT AS ANY OTHER MAN THE CARD IS SOME
HOCUSPOCUSA BLIND AS LIKE AS NOT THE ONLY QUESTION IS HOW DID
HE DEPART AH OF COURSE HERE IS A HOLE IN THE ROOF WITH GREAT
ACTIVITY CONSIDERING HIS BULK HE SPRANG UP THE STEPS AND SQUEEZED
THROUGH INTO THE GARRET AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WE HEARD HIS
EXULTING VOICE PROCLAIMING THAT HE HAD FOUND THE TRAPDOOR
HE CAN FIND SOMETHING REMARKED HOLMES SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS
HE HAS OCCASIONAL GLIMMERINGS OF REASON IL NY A PAS DES SOTS SI
INCOMMODES QUE CEUX QUI ONT DE LESPRIT
YOU SEE SAID ATHELNEY JONES REAPPEARING DOWN THE STEPS AGAIN
FACTS ARE BETTER THAN MERE THEORIES AFTER ALL MY VIEW OF THE CASE
IS CONFIRMED THERE IS A TRAPDOOR COMMUNICATING WITH THE ROOF AND
IT IS PARTLY OPEN
IT WAS I WHO OPENED IT
OH INDEED YOU DID NOTICE IT THEN HE SEEMED A LITTLE CRESTFALLEN
AT THE DISCOVERY WELL WHOEVER NOTICED IT IT SHOWS HOW OUR
GENTLEMAN GOT AWAY INSPECTOR
YES SIR FROM THE PASSAGE
ASK MR SHOLTO TO STEP THIS WAYMR SHOLTO IT IS MY DUTY TO
INFORM YOU THAT ANYTHING WHICH YOU MAY SAY WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU
I ARREST YOU IN THE QUEENS NAME AS BEING CONCERNED IN THE DEATH OF
YOUR BROTHER
THERE NOW DIDNT I TELL YOU CRIED THE POOR LITTLE MAN THROWING
OUT HIS HANDS AND LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US
DONT TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT IT MR SHOLTO SAID HOLMES I THINK
THAT I CAN ENGAGE TO CLEAR YOU OF THE CHARGE
DONT PROMISE TOO MUCH MR THEORISTDONT PROMISE TOO MUCH
SNAPPED THE DETECTIVE YOU MAY FIND IT A HARDER MATTER THAN YOU
THINK
NOT ONLY WILL I CLEAR HIM MR JONES BUT I WILL MAKE YOU A FREE
PRESENT OF THE NAME AND DESCRIPTION OF ONE OF THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE
IN THIS ROOM LAST NIGHT HIS NAME I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE IS

RIGHT LEG OFF AND WEARING A WOODEN STUMP WHICH IS WORN AWAY UPON THE
INNER SIDE HIS LEFT BOOT HAS A COARSE SQUARETOED SOLE WITH AN
IRON BAND ROUND THE HEEL HE IS A MIDDLEAGED MAN MUCH SUNBURNED
AND HAS BEEN A CONVICT THESE FEW INDICATIONS MAY BE OF SOME
ASSISTANCE TO YOU COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF
SKIN MISSING FROM THE PALM OF HIS HAND THE OTHER MAN
AH THE OTHER MAN ASKED ATHELNEY JONES IN A SNEERING VOICE BUT
IMPRESSED NONE THE LESS AS I COULD EASILY SEE BY THE PRECISION OF
THE OTHERS MANNER
IS A RATHER CURIOUS PERSON SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES TURNING UPON HIS
HEEL I HOPE BEFORE VERY LONG TO BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE
PAIR OF THEM A WORD WITH YOU WATSON
HE LED ME OUT TO THE HEAD OF THE STAIR THIS UNEXPECTED OCCURRENCE
HE SAID HAS CAUSED US RATHER TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE
OF OUR JOURNEY

CHAPTER VII
THE EPISODE OF THE BARREL
THE POLICE HAD BROUGHT A CAB WITH THEM AND IN THIS I ESCORTED MISS
MORSTAN BACK TO HER HOME AFTER THE ANGELIC FASHION OF WOMEN SHE HAD
BORNE TROUBLE WITH A CALM FACE AS LONG AS THERE WAS SOME ONE WEAKER
THAN HERSELF TO SUPPORT AND I HAD FOUND HER BRIGHT AND PLACID BY THE
SIDE OF THE FRIGHTENED HOUSEKEEPER IN THE CAB HOWEVER SHE FIRST
TURNED FAINT AND THEN BURST INTO A PASSION OF WEEPINGSO SORELY
HAD SHE BEEN TRIED BY THE ADVENTURES OF THE NIGHT SHE HAS TOLD ME
SINCE THAT SHE THOUGHT ME COLD AND DISTANT UPON THAT JOURNEY SHE
LITTLE GUESSED THE STRUGGLE WITHIN MY BREAST OR THE EFFORT OF
SELFRESTRAINT WHICH HELD ME BACK MY SYMPATHIES AND MY LOVE WENT OUT
TO HER EVEN AS MY HAND HAD IN THE GARDEN I FELT THAT YEARS OF THE
CONVENTIONALITIES OF LIFE COULD NOT TEACH ME TO KNOW HER SWEET BRAVE
NATURE AS HAD THIS ONE DAY OF STRANGE EXPERIENCES YET THERE WERE TWO
THOUGHTS WHICH SEALED THE WORDS OF AFFECTION UPON MY LIPS SHE WAS
WEAK AND HELPLESS SHAKEN IN MIND AND NERVE IT WAS TO TAKE HER AT A
DISADVANTAGE TO OBTRUDE LOVE UPON HER AT SUCH A TIME WORSE STILL
SHE WAS RICH IF HOLMESS RESEARCHES WERE SUCCESSFUL SHE WOULD BE AN
HEIRESS WAS IT FAIR WAS IT HONORABLE THAT A HALFPAY SURGEON
SHOULD TAKE SUCH ADVANTAGE OF AN INTIMACY WHICH CHANCE HAD BROUGHT
ABOUT MIGHT SHE NOT LOOK UPON ME AS A MERE VULGAR FORTUNESEEKER I
COULD NOT BEAR TO RISK THAT SUCH A THOUGHT SHOULD CROSS HER MIND
THIS AGRA TREASURE INTERVENED LIKE AN IMPASSABLE BARRIER BETWEEN US
IT WAS NEARLY TWO OCLOCK WHEN WE REACHED MRS CECIL FORRESTERS THE
SERVANTS HAD RETIRED HOURS AGO BUT MRS FORRESTER HAD BEEN SO
INTERESTED BY THE STRANGE MESSAGE WHICH MISS MORSTAN HAD RECEIVED
THAT SHE HAD SAT UP IN THE HOPE OF HER RETURN SHE OPENED THE DOOR
HERSELF A MIDDLEAGED GRACEFUL WOMAN AND IT GAVE ME JOY TO SEE HOW
TENDERLY HER ARM STOLE ROUND THE OTHERS WAIST AND HOW MOTHERLY WAS
THE VOICE IN WHICH SHE GREETED HER SHE WAS CLEARLY NO MERE PAID
DEPENDANT BUT AN HONORED FRIEND I WAS INTRODUCED AND MRS
FORRESTER EARNESTLY BEGGED ME TO STEP IN AND TELL HER OUR ADVENTURES
I EXPLAINED HOWEVER THE IMPORTANCE OF MY ERRAND AND PROMISED
FAITHFULLY TO CALL AND REPORT ANY PROGRESS WHICH WE MIGHT MAKE WITH
THE CASE AS WE DROVE AWAY I STOLE A GLANCE BACK AND I STILL SEEM TO
SEE THAT LITTLE GROUP ON THE STEP THE TWO GRACEFUL CLINGING
FIGURES THE HALFOPENED DOOR THE HALL LIGHT SHINING THROUGH STAINED
GLASS THE BAROMETER AND THE BRIGHT STAIRRODS IT WAS SOOTHING TO
CATCH EVEN THAT PASSING GLIMPSE OF A TRANQUIL ENGLISH HOME IN THE
MIDST OF THE WILD DARK BUSINESS WHICH HAD ABSORBED US
AND THE MORE I THOUGHT OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE WILDER AND DARKER IT
GREW I REVIEWED THE WHOLE EXTRAORDINARY SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AS I
RATTLED ON THROUGH THE SILENT GASLIT STREETS THERE WAS THE ORIGINAL
PROBLEM THAT AT LEAST WAS PRETTY CLEAR NOW THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN
MORSTAN THE SENDING OF THE PEARLS THE ADVERTISEMENT THE
LETTERWE HAD HAD LIGHT UPON ALL THOSE EVENTS THEY HAD ONLY LED
US HOWEVER TO A DEEPER AND FAR MORE TRAGIC MYSTERY THE INDIAN
TREASURE THE CURIOUS PLAN FOUND AMONG MORSTANS BAGGAGE THE STRANGE
SCENE AT MAJOR SHOLTOS DEATH THE REDISCOVERY OF THE TREASURE
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY THE MURDER OF THE DISCOVERER THE VERY
SINGULAR ACCOMPANIMENTS TO THE CRIME THE FOOTSTEPS THE REMARKABLE
WEAPONS THE WORDS UPON THE CARD CORRESPONDING WITH THOSE UPON
CAPTAIN MORSTANS CHARTHERE WAS INDEED A LABYRINTH IN WHICH A MAN
LESS SINGULARLY ENDOWED THAN MY FELLOWLODGER MIGHT WELL DESPAIR OF
EVER FINDING THE CLUE
PINCHIN LANE WAS A ROW OF SHABBY TWOSTORIED BRICK HOUSES IN THE
LOWER QUARTER OF LAMBETH I HAD TO KNOCK FOR SOME TIME AT NO BEFORE I
COULD MAKE MY IMPRESSION AT LAST HOWEVER THERE WAS THE
GLINT OF A CANDLE BEHIND THE BLIND AND A FACE LOOKED OUT AT THE
UPPER WINDOW
GO ON YOU DRUNKEN VAGABONE SAID THE FACE IF YOU KICK UP ANY
MORE ROW ILL OPEN THE KENNELS AND LET OUT FORTYTHREE DOGS UPON
YOU
IF YOULL LET ONE OUT ITS JUST WHAT I HAVE COME FOR SAID I
GO ON YELLED THE VOICE SO HELP ME GRACIOUS I HAVE A WIPER IN
THE BAG AN ILL DROP IT ON YOUR EAD IF YOU DONT HOOK IT
BUT I WANT A DOG I CRIED
I WONT BE ARGUED WITH SHOUTED MR SHERMAN NOW STAND CLEAR FOR
WHEN I SAY THREE DOWN GOES THE WIPER
MR SHERLOCK HOLMES I BEGAN BUT THE WORDS HAD A MOST MAGICAL
EFFECT FOR THE WINDOW INSTANTLY SLAMMED DOWN AND WITHIN A MINUTE
THE DOOR WAS UNBARRED AND OPEN MR SHERMAN WAS A LANKY LEAN OLD
MAN WITH STOOPING SHOULDERS A STRINGY NECK AND BLUETINTED
GLASSES
A FRIEND OF MR SHERLOCK IS ALWAYS WELCOME SAID HE STEP IN
SIR KEEP CLEAR OF THE BADGER FOR HE BITES AH NAUGHTY NAUGHTY
WOULD YOU TAKE A NIP AT THE GENTLEMAN THIS TO A STOAT WHICH THRUST
ITS WICKED HEAD AND RED EYES BETWEEN THE BARS OF ITS CAGE DONT

GIVES IT THE RUN O THE ROOM FOR IT KEEPS THE BETTLES DOWN YOU MUST
NOT MIND MY BEIN JUST A LITTLE SHORT WI YOU AT FIRST FOR IM GUYED
AT BY THE CHILDREN AND THERES MANY A ONE JUST COMES DOWN THIS LANE
TO KNOCK ME UP WHAT WAS IT THAT MR SHERLOCK HOLMES WANTED SIR
HE WANTED A DOG OF YOURS
AH THAT WOULD BE TOBY
YES TOBY WAS THE NAME
TOBY LIVES AT NO ON THE LEFT HERE HE MOVED SLOWLY FORWARD WITH
HIS CANDLE AMONG THE QUEER ANIMAL FAMILY WHICH HE HAD GATHERED ROUND
HIM IN THE UNCERTAIN SHADOWY LIGHT I COULD SEE DIMLY THAT THERE
WERE GLANCING GLIMMERING EYES PEEPING DOWN AT US FROM EVERY CRANNY
AND CORNER EVEN THE RAFTERS ABOVE OUR HEADS WERE LINED BY SOLEMN
FOWLS WHO LAZILY SHIFTED THEIR WEIGHT FROM ONE LEG TO THE OTHER AS
OUR VOICES DISTURBED THEIR SLUMBERS
TOBY PROVED TO AN UGLY LONGHAIRED LOPEARED CREATURE HALF SPANIEL
AND HALF LURCHER BROWNANDWHITE IN COLOR WITH A VERY CLUMSY
WADDLING GAIT IT ACCEPTED AFTER SOME HESITATION A LUMP OF SUGAR
WHICH THE OLD NATURALIST HANDED TO ME AND HAVING THUS SEALED AN
ALLIANCE IT FOLLOWED ME TO THE CAB AND MADE NO DIFFICULTIES ABOUT
ACCOMPANYING ME IT HAD JUST STRUCK THREE ON THE PALACE CLOCK WHEN I
FOUND MYSELF BACK ONCE MORE AT PONDICHERRY LODGE THE
EXPRIZEFIGHTER MCMURDO HAD I FOUND BEEN ARRESTED AS AN ACCESSORY
AND BOTH HE AND MR SHOLTO HAD BEEN MARCHED OFF TO THE STATION TWO
CONSTABLES GUARDED THE NARROW GATE BUT THEY ALLOWED ME TO PASS WITH
THE DOG ON MY MENTIONING THE DETECTIVES NAME
HOLMES WAS STANDING ON THE DOORSTEP WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
SMOKING HIS PIPE
AH YOU HAVE HIM THERE SAID HE GOOD DOG THEN ATHELNEY JONES
HAS GONE WE HAVE HAD AN IMMENSE DISPLAY OF ENERGY SINCE YOU LEFT HE
HAS ARRESTED NOT ONLY FRIEND THADDEUS BUT THE GATEKEEPER THE
HOUSEKEEPER AND THE INDIAN SERVANT WE HAVE THE PLACE TO OURSELVES
BUT FOR A SERGEANT UPSTAIRS LEAVE THE DOG HERE AND COME UP
WE TIED TOBY TO THE HALL TABLE AND REASCENDED THE STAIRS THE ROOM
WAS AS WE HAD LEFT IT SAVE THAT A SHEET HAD BEEN DRAPED OVER THE
CENTRAL FIGURE A WEARYLOOKING POLICESERGEANT RECLINED IN THE
CORNER
LEND ME YOUR BULLSEYE SERGEANT SAID MY COMPANION NOW TIE THIS
BIT OF CARD ROUND MY NECK SO AS TO HANG IT IN FRONT OF ME THANK
YOU NOW I MUST KICK OFF MY BOOTS AND STOCKINGSJUST YOU CARRY THEM
DOWN WITH YOU WATSON I AM GOING TO DO A LITTLE CLIMBING AND DIP MY
HANDKERCHIEF INTO THE CREASOTE THAT WILL DO NOW COME UP INTO THE
GARRET WITH ME FOR A MOMENT
WE CLAMBERED UP THROUGH THE HOLE HOLMES TURNED HIS LIGHT ONCE MORE
UPON THE FOOTSTEPS IN THE DUST
I WISH YOU PARTICULARLY TO NOTICE THESE FOOTMARKS HE SAID DO YOU
OBSERVE ANYTHING NOTEWORTHY ABOUT THEM
THEY BELONG I SAID TO A CHILD OR A SMALL WOMAN
APART FROM THEIR SIZE THOUGH IS THERE NOTHING ELSE
THEY APPEAR TO BE MUCH AS OTHER FOOTMARKS
NOT AT ALL LOOK HERE THIS IS THE PRINT OF A RIGHT FOOT IN THE
DUST NOW I MAKE ONE WITH MY NAKED FOOT BESIDE IT WHAT IS THE CHIEF
DIFFERENCE
YOUR TOES ARE ALL CRAMPED TOGETHER THE OTHER PRINT HAS EACH TOE
DISTINCTLY DIVIDED
QUITE SO THAT IS THE POINT BEAR THAT IN MIND NOW WOULD YOU
KINDLY STEP OVER TO THAT FLAPWINDOW AND SMELL THE EDGE OF THE
WOODWORK I SHALL STAY HERE AS I HAVE THIS HANDKERCHIEF IN MY
HAND
I DID AS HE DIRECTED AND WAS INSTANTLY CONSCIOUS OF A STRONG TARRY
SMELL
THAT IS WHERE HE PUT HIS FOOT IN GETTING OUT IF YOU CAN TRACE HIM
I SHOULD THINK THAT TOBY WILL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY NOW RUN
DOWNSTAIRS LOOSE THE DOG AND LOOK OUT FOR BLONDIN
BY THE TIME THAT I GOT OUT INTO THE GROUNDS SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS ON
THE ROOF AND I COULD SEE HIM LIKE AN ENORMOUS GLOWWORM CRAWLING
VERY SLOWLY ALONG THE RIDGE I LOST SIGHT OF HIM BEHIND A STACK OF
CHIMNEYS BUT HE PRESENTLY REAPPEARED AND THEN VANISHED ONCE MORE
UPON THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHEN I MADE MY WAY ROUND THERE I FOUND HIM
SEATED AT ONE OF THE CORNER EAVES
THAT YOU WATSON HE CRIED
YES
THIS IS THE PLACE WHAT IS THAT BLACK THING DOWN THERE
A WATERBARREL
TOP ON IT
YES
NO SIGN OF A LADDER
NO
CONFOUND THE FELLOW ITS A MOST BREAKNECK PLACE I OUGHT TO BE
ABLE TO COME DOWN WHERE HE COULD CLIMB UP THE WATERPIPE FEELS
PRETTY FIRM HERE GOES ANYHOW
THERE WAS A SCUFFLING OF FEET AND THE LANTERN BEGAN TO COME STEADILY
DOWN THE SIDE OF THE WALL THEN WITH A LIGHT SPRING HE CAME ON TO THE
BARREL AND FROM THERE TO THE EARTH
IT WAS EASY TO FOLLOW HIM HE SAID DRAWING ON HIS STOCKINGS AND
BOOTS TILES WERE LOOSENED THE WHOLE WAY ALONG AND IN HIS HURRY HE
HAD DROPPED THIS IT CONFIRMS MY DIAGNOSIS AS YOU DOCTORS EXPRESS
IT
THE OBJECT WHICH HE HELD UP TO ME WAS A SMALL POCKET OR POUCH WOVEN
OUT OF COLORED GRASSES AND WITH A FEW TAWDRY BEADS STRUNG ROUND IT
IN SHAPE AND SIZE IT WAS NOT UNLIKE A CIGARETTECASE INSIDE WERE
HALF A DOZEN SPINES OF DARK WOOD SHARP AT ONE END AND ROUNDED AT THE
OTHER LIKE THAT WHICH HAD STRUCK BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTO
THEY ARE HELLISH THINGS SAID HE LOOK OUT THAT YOU DONT PRICK
YOURSELF IM DELIGHTED TO HAVE THEM FOR THE CHANCES ARE THAT THEY
ARE ALL HE HAS THERE IS THE LESS FEAR OF YOU OR ME FINDING ONE IN
OUR SKIN BEFORE LONG I WOULD SOONER FACE A MARTINI BULLET MYSELF
ARE YOU GAME FOR A SIXMILE TRUDGE WATSON
CERTAINLY I ANSWERED
YOUR LEG WILL STAND IT
OH YES
HERE YOU ARE DOGGY GOOD OLD TOBY SMELL IT TOBY SMELL IT HE
PUSHED THE CREASOTE HANDKERCHIEF UNDER THE DOGS NOSE WHILE THE
CREATURE STOOD WITH ITS FLUFFY LEGS SEPARATED AND WITH A MOST
COMICAL COCK TO ITS HEAD LIKE A CONNOISSEUR SNIFFING THE BOUQUET OF
A FAMOUS VINTAGE HOLMES THEN THREW THE HANDKERCHIEF TO A DISTANCE
FASTENED A STOUT CORD TO THE MONGRELS COLLAR AND LET HIM TO THE
FOOT OF THE WATERBARREL THE CREATURE INSTANTLY BROKE INTO A
SUCCESSION OF HIGH TREMULOUS YELPS AND WITH HIS NOSE ON THE
GROUND AND HIS TAIL IN THE AIR PATTERED OFF UPON THE TRAIL AT A
PACE WHICH STRAINED HIS LEASH AND KEPT US AT THE TOP OF OUR SPEED
THE EAST HAD BEEN GRADUALLY WHITENING AND WE COULD NOW SEE SOME
DISTANCE IN THE COLD GRAY LIGHT THE SQUARE MASSIVE HOUSE WITH ITS
BLACK EMPTY WINDOWS AND HIGH BARE WALLS TOWERED UP SAD AND
FORLORN BEHIND US OUR COURSE LET RIGHT ACROSS THE GROUNDS IN AND
OUT AMONG THE TRENCHES AND PITS WITH WHICH THEY WERE SCARRED AND
INTERSECTED THE WHOLE PLACE WITH ITS SCATTERED DIRTHEAPS AND
ILLGROWN SHRUBS HAD A BLIGHTED ILLOMENED LOOK WHICH HARMONIZED
WITH THE BLACK TRAGEDY WHICH HUNG OVER IT
ON REACHING THE BOUNDARY WALL TOBY RAN ALONG WHINING EAGERLY
UNDERNEATH ITS SHADOW AND STOPPED FINALLY IN A CORNER SCREENED BY A
YOUNG BEECH WHERE THE TWO WALLS JOINED SEVERAL BRICKS HAD BEEN
LOOSENED AND THE CREVICES LEFT WERE WORN DOWN AND ROUNDED UPON THE
LOWER SIDE AS THOUGH THEY HAD FREQUENTLY BEEN USED AS A LADDER
HOLMES CLAMBERED UP AND TAKING THE DOG FROM ME HE DROPPED IT OVER
UPON THE OTHER SIDE
THERES THE PRINT OF WOODENLEGS HAND HE REMARKED AS I MOUNTED
UP BESIDE HIM YOU SEE THE SLIGHT SMUDGE OF BLOOD UPON THE WHITE
PLASTER WHAT A LUCKY THING IT IS THAT WE HAVE HAD NO VERY HEAVY RAIN
SINCE YESTERDAY THE SCENT WILL LIE UPON THE ROAD IN SPITE OF THEIR
EIGHTANDTWENTY HOURS START
I CONFESS THAT I HAD MY DOUBTS MYSELF WHEN I REFLECTED UPON THE GREAT
TRAFFIC WHICH HAD PASSED ALONG THE LONDON ROAD IN THE INTERVAL MY
FEARS WERE SOON APPEASED HOWEVER TOBY NEVER HESITATED OR SWERVED
BUT WADDLED ON IN HIS PECULIAR ROLLING FASHION CLEARLY THE PUNGENT
SMELL OF THE CREASOTE ROSE HIGH ABOVE ALL OTHER CONTENDING SCENTS
DO NOT IMAGINE SAID HOLMES THAT I DEPEND FOR MY SUCCESS IN THIS
CASE UPON THE MERE CHANCE OF ONE OF THESE FELLOWS HAVING PUT HIS FOOT
IN THE CHEMICAL I HAVE KNOWLEDGE NOW WHICH WOULD ENABLE ME TO TRACE
THEM IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THIS HOWEVER IS THE READIEST AND
SINCE FORTUNE HAS PUT IT INTO OUR HANDS I SHOULD BE CULPABLE IF I
NEGLECTED IT IT HAS HOWEVER PREVENTED THE CASE FROM BECOMING THE
PRETTY LITTLE INTELLECTUAL PROBLEM WHICH IT AT ONE TIME PROMISED TO
BE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME CREDIT TO BE GAINED OUT OF IT BUT FOR
THIS TOO PALPABLE CLUE
THERE IS CREDIT AND TO SPARE SAID I I ASSURE YOU HOLMES THAT
I MARVEL AT THE MEANS BY WHICH YOU OBTAIN YOUR RESULTS IN THIS CASE
EVEN MORE THAN I DID IN THE JEFFERSON HOPE MURDER THE THING SEEMS TO
ME TO BE DEEPER AND MORE INEXPLICABLE HOW FOR EXAMPLE COULD YOU
DESCRIBE WITH SUCH CONFIDENCE THE WOODENLEGGED MAN
PSHAW MY DEAR BOY IT WAS SIMPLICITY ITSELF I DONT WISH TO BE
THEATRICAL IT IS ALL PATENT AND ABOVEBOARD TWO OFFICERS WHO ARE IN
COMMAND OF A CONVICTGUARD LEARN AN IMPORTANT SECRET AS TO BURIED
TREASURE A MAP IS DRAWN FOR THEM BY AN ENGLISHMAN NAMED JONATHAN
SMALL YOU REMEMBER THAT WE SAW THE NAME UPON THE CHART IN CAPTAIN
MORSTANS POSSESSION HE HAD SIGNED IT IN BEHALF OF HIMSELF AND HIS
ASSOCIATESTHE SIGN OF THE FOUR AS HE SOMEWHAT DRAMATICALLY CALLED
IT AIDED BY THIS CHART THE OFFICERSOR ONE OF THEMGETS THE
TREASURE AND BRINGS IT TO ENGLAND LEAVING WE WILL SUPPOSE SOME
CONDITION UNDER WHICH HE RECEIVED IT UNFULFILLED NOW THEN WHY DID
NOT JONATHAN SMALL GET THE TREASURE HIMSELF THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUS
THE CHART IS DATED AT A TIME WHEN MORSTAN WAS BROUGHT INTO CLOSE
ASSOCIATION WITH CONVICTS JONATHAN SMALL DID NOT GET THE TREASURE
BECAUSE HE AND HIS ASSOCIATES WERE THEMSELVES CONVICTS AND COULD NOT
GET AWAY
BUT THAT IS MERE SPECULATION SAID I
IT IS MORE THAN THAT IT IS THE ONLY HYPOTHESIS WHICH COVERS THE
FACTS LET US SEE HOW IT FITS IN WITH THE SEQUEL MAJOR SHOLTO
REMAINS AT PEACE FOR SOME YEARS HAPPY IN THE POSSESSION OF HIS
TREASURE THEN HE RECEIVES A LETTER FROM INDIA WHICH GIVES HIM A
GREAT FRIGHT WHAT WAS THAT
A LETTER TO SAY THAT THE MEN WHOM HE HAD WRONGED HAD BEEN SET FREE
OR HAD ESCAPED THAT IS MUCH MORE LIKELY FOR HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN
WHAT THEIR TERM OF IMPRISONMENT WAS IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A
SURPRISE TO HIM WHAT DOES HE DO THEN HE GUARDS HIMSELF AGAINST A
WOODENLEGGED MANA WHITE MAN MARK YOU FOR HE MISTAKES A WHITE
TRADESMAN FOR HIM AND ACTUALLY FIRES A PISTOL AT HIM NOW ONLY ONE
WHITE MANS NAME IS ON THE CHART THE OTHERS ARE HINDOOS OR
MOHAMMEDANS THERE IS NO OTHER WHITE MAN THEREFORE WE MAY SAY WITH
CONFIDENCE THAT THE WOODENLEGGED MAN IS IDENTICAL WITH JONATHAN
SMALL DOES THE REASONING STRIKE YO AS BEING FAULTY
NO IT IS CLEAR AND CONCISE
WELL NOW LET US PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF JONATHAN SMALL LET
US LOOK AT IT FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW HE COMES TO ENGLAND WITH THE
DOUBLE IDEA OF REGAINING WHAT HE WOULD CONSIDER TO BE HIS RIGHTS AND
OF HAVING HIS REVENGE UPON THE MAN WHO HAD WRONGED HIM HE FOUND OUT
WHERE SHOLTO LIVED AND VERY POSSIBLY HE ESTABLISHED COMMUNICATIONS
WITH SOME ONE INSIDE THE HOUSE THERE IS THIS BUTLER LAL RAO WHOM
WE HAVE NOT SEEN MRS BERNSTONE GIVES HIM FAR FROM A GOOD CHARACTER
SMALL COULD NOT FIND OUT HOWEVER WHERE THE TREASURE WAS HID FOR NO
ONE EVER KNEW SAVE THE MAJOR AND ONE FAITHFUL SERVANT WHO HAD DIED
SUDDENLY SMALL LEARNS THAT THE MAJOR IS ON HIS DEATHBED IN A FRENZY
LEST THE SECRET OF THE TREASURE DIE WITH HIM HE RUNS THE GAUNTLET OF
THE GUARDS MAKES HIS WAY TO THE DYING MANS WINDOW AND IS ONLY
DETERRED FROM ENTERING BY THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO SONS MAD WITH
HATE HOWEVER AGAINST THE DEAD MAN HE ENTERS THE ROOM THAT NIGHT
SEARCHES HIS PRIVATE PAPERS IN THE HOPE OF DISCOVERING SOME
MEMORANDUM RELATING TO THE TREASURE AND FINALLY LEAVES A MEMENTO OF
HIS VISIT IN THE SHORT INSCRIPTION UPON THE CARD HE HAD DOUBTLESS
PLANNED BEFOREHAND THAT SHOULD HE SLAY THE MAJOR HE WOULD LEAVE SOME
SUCH RECORD UPON THE BODY AS A SIGN THAT IT WAS NOT A COMMON MURDER
BUT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE FOUR ASSOCIATES SOMETHING IN THE
NATURE OF AN ACT OF JUSTICE WHIMSICAL AND BIZARRE CONCEITS OF THIS
KIND ARE COMMON ENOUGH IN THE ANNALS OF CRIME AND USUALLY AFFORD
VALUABLE INDICATIONS AS TO THE CRIMINAL DO YOU FOLLOW ALL THIS
VERY CLEARLY
NOW WHAT COULD JONATHAN SMALL DO HE COULD ONLY CONTINUE TO KEEP A
SECRET WATCH UPON THE EFFORTS MADE TO FIND THE TREASURE POSSIBLY HE
LEAVES ENGLAND AND ONLY COMES BACK AT INTERVALS THEN COMES THE
DISCOVERY OF THE GARRET AND HE IS INSTANTLY INFORMED OF IT WE AGAIN
TRACE THE PRESENCE OF SOME CONFEDERATE IN THE HOUSEHOLD JONATHAN
WITH HIS WOODEN LEG IS UTTERLY UNABLE TO REACH THE LOFTY ROOM OF
BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTO HE TAKES WITH HIM HOWEVER A RATHER CURIOUS
ASSOCIATE WHO GETS OVER THIS DIFFICULTY BUT DIPS HIS NAKED FOOT
INTO CREASOTE WHENCE COME TOBY AND A SIXMILE LIMP FOR A HALFPAY
OFFICER WITH A DAMAGED TENDO ACHILLIS
BUT IT WAS THE ASSOCIATE AND NOT JONATHAN WHO COMMITTED THE
CRIME
QUITE SO AND RATHER TO JONATHANS DISGUST TO JUDGE BY THE WAY THE
STAMPED ABOUT WHEN HE GOT INTO THE ROOM HE BORE NO GRUDGE AGAINST
BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTO AND WOULD HAVE PREFERRED IF HE COULD HAVE BEEN
SIMPLY BOUND AND GAGGED HE DID NOT WISH TO PUT HIS HEAD IN A HALTER
THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT HOWEVER THE SAVAGE INSTINCTS OF HIS
COMPANION HAD BROKEN OUT AND THE POISON HAD DONE ITS WORK SO
JONATHAN SMALL LEFT HIS RECORD LOWERED THE TREASUREBOX TO THE
GROUND AND FOLLOWED IT HIMSELF THAT WAS THE TRAIN OF EVENTS AS FAR
AS I CAN DECIPHER THEM OF COURSE AS TO HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE HE
MUST BE MIDDLEAGED AND MUST BE SUNBURNED AFTER SERVING HIS TIME IN
SUCH AN OVEN AS THE ANDAMANS HIS HEIGHT IS READILY CALCULATED FROM
THE LENGTH OF HIS STRIDE AND WE KNOW THAT HE WAS BEARDED HIS
HAIRINESS WAS THE ONE POINT WHICH IMPRESSED ITSELF UPON THADDEUS
SHOLTO WHEN HE SAW HIM AT THE WINDOW I DONT KNOW THAT THERE IS
ANYTHING ELSE
THE ASSOCIATE
AH WELL THERE IS NO GREAT MYSTERY IN THAT BUT YOU WILL KNOW ALL
ABOUT IT SOON ENOUGH HOW SWEET THE MORNING AIR IS SEE HOW THAT ONE
LITTLE CLOUD FLOATS LIKE A PINK FEATHER FROM SOME GIGANTIC FLAMINGO
NOW THE RED RIM OF THE SUN PUSHES ITSELF OVER THE LONDON CLOUDBANK
IT SHINES ON A GOOD MANY FOLK BUT ON NONE I DARE BET WHO ARE ON A
STRANGER ERRAND THAN YOU AND I HOW SMALL WE FEEL WITH OUR PETTY
AMBITIONS AND STRIVINGS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GREAT ELEMENTAL FORCES
OF NATURE ARE YOU WELL UP IN YOUR JEAN PAUL
FAIRLY SO I WORKED BACK TO HIM THROUGH CARLYLE
THAT WAS LIKE FOLLOWING THE BROOK TO THE PARENT LAKE HE MAKES ONE
CURIOUS BUT PROFOUND REMARK IT IS THAT THE CHIEF PROOF OF MANS REAL
GREATNESS LIES IN HIS PERCEPTION OF HIS OWN SMALLNESS IT ARGUES YOU
SEE A POWER OF COMPARISON AND OF APPRECIATION WHICH IS IN ITSELF A
PROOF OF NOBILITY THERE IS MUCH FOOD FOR THOUGHT IN RICHTER YOU
HAVE NOT A PISTOL HAVE YOU
I HAVE MY STICK
IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY NEED SOMETHING OF THE SORT IF WE GET
TO THEIR LAIR JONATHAN I SHALL LEAVE TO YOU BUT IF THE OTHER TURNS
NASTY I SHALL SHOOT HIM DEAD HE TOOK OUT HIS REVOLVER AS HE SPOKE
AND HAVING LOADED TWO OF THE CHAMBERS HE PUT IT BACK INTO THE
RIGHTHAND POCKET OF HIS JACKET
WE HAD DURING THIS TIME BEEN FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE OF TOBY DOWN THE
HALFRURAL VILLALINED ROADS WHICH LEAD TO THE METROPOLIS NOW
HOWEVER WE WERE BEGINNING TO COME AMONG CONTINUOUS STREETS WHERE
LABORERS AND DOCKMEN WERE ALREADY ASTIR AND SLATTERNLY WOMEN WERE
TAKING DOWN SHUTTERS AND BRUSHING DOORSTEPS AT THE SQUARETOPPED
CORNER PUBLIC HOUSES BUSINESS WAS JUST BEGINNING AND ROUGHLOOKING
MEN WERE EMERGING RUBBING THEIR SLEEVES ACROSS THEIR BEARDS AFTER
THEIR MORNING WET STRANGE DOGS SAUNTERED UP AND STARED WONDERINGLY
AT US AS WE PASSED BUT OUR INIMITABLE TOBY LOOKED NEITHER TO THE
RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT BUT TROTTED ONWARDS WITH HIS NOSE TO THE
GROUND AND AN OCCASIONAL EAGER WHINE WHICH SPOKE OF A HOT SCENT
WE HAD TRAVERSED STREATHAM BRIXTON CAMBERWELL AND NOW FOUND
OURSELVES IN KENNINGTON LANE HAVING BORNE AWAY THROUGH THE
SIDESTREETS TO THE EAST OF THE OVAL THE MEN WHOM WE PURSUED SEEMED
TO HAVE TAKEN A CURIOUSLY ZIGZAG ROAD WITH THE IDEA PROBABLY OF
ESCAPING OBSERVATION THEY HAD NEVER KEPT TO THE MAIN ROAD IF A
PARALLEL SIDESTREET WOULD SERVE THEIR TURN AT THE FOOT OF
KENNINGTON LANE THEY HAD EDGED AWAY TO THE LEFT THROUGH BOND STREET
AND MILES STREET WHERE THE LATTER STREET TURNS INTO KNIGHTS PLACE
TOBY CEASED TO ADVANCE BUT BEGAN TO RUN BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH
ONE EAR COCKED AND THE OTHER DROOPING THE VERY PICTURE OF CANINE
INDECISION THEN HE WADDLED ROUND IN CIRCLES LOOKING UP TO US FROM
TIME TO TIME AS IF TO ASK FOR SYMPATHY IN HIS EMBARRASSMENT
WHAT THE DEUCE IS THE MATTER WITH THE DOG GROWLED HOLMES THEY
SURELY WOULD NOT TAKE A CAB OR GO OFF IN A BALLOON
PERHAPS THEY STOOD HERE FOR SOME TIME I SUGGESTED
AH ITS ALL RIGHT HES OFF AGAIN SAID MY COMPANION IN A TONE OF
RELIEF
HE WAS INDEED OFF FOR AFTER SNIFFING ROUND AGAIN HE SUDDENLY MADE UP
HIS MIND AND DARTED AWAY WITH AN ENERGY AND DETERMINATION SUCH AS HE
HAD NOT YET SHOWN THE SCENT APPEARED TO BE MUCH HOTTER THAN BEFORE
FOR HE HAD NOT EVEN TO PUT HIS NOSE ON THE GROUND BUT TUGGED AT HIS
LEASH AND TRIED TO BREAK INTO A RUN I COLD SEE BY THE GLEAM IN
HOLMESS EYES THAT HE THOUGHT WE WERE NEARING THE END OF OUR JOURNEY
OUR COURSE NOW RAN DOWN NINE ELMS UNTIL WE CAME TO BRODERICK AND
NELSONS LARGE TIMBERYARD JUST PAST THE WHITE EAGLE TAVERN HERE
THE DOG FRANTIC WITH EXCITEMENT TURNED DOWN THROUGH THE SIDEGATE
INTO THE ENCLOSURE WHERE THE SAWYERS WERE ALREADY AT WORK ON THE
DOG RACED THROUGH SAWDUST AND SHAVINGS DOWN AN ALLEY ROUND A
PASSAGE BETWEEN TWO WOODPILES AND FINALLY WITH A TRIUMPHANT YELP
SPRANG UPON A LARGE BARREL WHICH STILL STOOD UPON THE HANDTROLLEY ON
WHICH IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT WITH LOLLING TONGUE AND BLINKING EYES
TOBY STOOD UPON THE CASK LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US FOR
SOME SIGN OF APPRECIATION THE STAVES OF THE BARREL AND THE WHEELS OF
THE TROLLEY WERE SMEARED WITH A DARK LIQUID AND THE WHOLE AIR WAS
HEAVY WITH THE SMELL OF CREASOTE
SHERLOCK HOLMES AND I LOOKED BLANKLY AT EACH OTHER AND THEN BURST
SIMULTANEOUSLY INTO AN UNCONTROLLABLE FIT OF LAUGHTER
CHAPTER VIII
THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS
WHAT NOW I ASKED TOBY HAS LOST HIS CHARACTER FOR INFALLIBILITY
HE ACTED ACCORDING TO HIS LIGHTS SAID HOLMES LIFTING HIM DOWN
FROM THE BARREL AND WALKING HIM OUT OF THE TIMBERYARD IF YOU
CONSIDER HOW MUCH CREASOTE IS CARTED ABOUT LONDON IN ONE DAY IT IS
NO GREAT WONDER THAT OUR TRAIL SHOULD HAVE BEEN CROSSED IT IS MUCH
USED NOW ESPECIALLY FOR THE SEASONING OF WOOD POOR TOBY IS NOT TO
BLAME
WE MUST GET ON THE MAIN SCENT AGAIN I SUPPOSE
YES AND FORTUNATELY WE HAVE NO DISTANCE TO GO EVIDENTLY WHAT
PUZZLED THE DOG AT THE CORNER OF KNIGHTS PLACE WAS THAT THERE WERE
TWO DIFFERENT TRAILS RUNNING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS WE TOOK THE
WRONG ONE IT ONLY REMAINS TO FOLLOW THE OTHER
THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT THIS ON LEADING TOBY TO THE PLACE
WHERE HE HAD COMMITTED HIS FAULT HE CAST ABOUT IN A WIDE CIRCLE AND
FINALLY DASHED OFF IN A FRESH DIRECTION
WE MUST TAKE CARE THAT HE DOES NOT NOW BRING US TO THE PLACE WHERE
THE CREASOTEBARREL CAME FROM I OBSERVED
I HAD THOUGHT OF THAT BUT YOU NOTICE THAT HE KEEPS ON THE PAVEMENT
WHEREAS THE BARREL PASSED DOWN THE ROADWAY NO WE ARE ON THE TRUE
SCENT NOW
IT TENDED DOWN TOWARDS THE RIVERSIDE RUNNING THROUGH BELMONT PLACE
AND PRINCES STREET AT THE END OF BROAD STREET IT RAN RIGHT DOWN TO
THE WATERS EDGE WHERE THERE WAS A SMALL WOODEN WHARF TOBY LED US
TO THE VERY EDGE OF THIS AND THERE STOOD WHINING LOOKING OUT ON THE
DARK CURRENT BEYOND
WE ARE OUT OF LUCK SAID HOLMES THEY HAVE TAKEN TO A BOAT HERE
SEVERAL SMALL PUNTS AND SKIFFS WERE LYING ABOUT IN THE WATER AND ON
THE EDGE OF THE WHARF WE TOOK TOBY ROUND TO EACH IN TURN BUT
THOUGH HE SNIFFED EARNESTLY HE MADE NO SIGN
CLOSE TO THE RUDE LANDINGSTAGE WAS A SMALL BRICK HOUSE WITH A
WOODEN PLACARD SLUNG OUT THROUGH THE SECOND WINDOW MORDECAI SMITH
WAS PRINTED ACROSS IT IN LARGE LETTERS AND UNDERNEATH BOATS TO
HIRE BY THE HOUR OR DAY A SECOND INSCRIPTION ABOVE THE DOOR
INFORMED US THAT A STEAM LAUNCH WAS KEPTA STATEMENT WHICH WAS
CONFIRMED BY A GREAT PILE OF COKE UPON THE JETTY SHERLOCK HOLMES
LOOKED SLOWLY ROUND AND HIS FACE ASSUMED AN OMINOUS EXPRESSION
THIS LOOKS BAD SAID HE THESE FELLOWS ARE SHARPER THAN I
EXPECTED THEY SEEM TO HAVE COVERED THEIR TRACKS THERE HAS I FEAR
BEEN PRECONCERTED MANAGEMENT HERE
HE WAS APPROACHING THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE WHEN IT OPENED AND A
LITTLE CURLYHEADED LAD OF SIX CAME RUNNING OUT FOLLOWED BY A
STOUTISH REDFACED WOMAN WITH A LARGE SPONGE IN HER HAND
YOU COME BACK AND BE WASHED JACK SHE SHOUTED COME BACK YOU
YOUNG IMP FOR IF YOUR FATHER COMES HOME AND FINDS YOU LIKE THAT

BOAT SIR MAYBE I COULD SERVE AS WELL

BARGE ID HA THOUGHT NOTHIN FOR MANY A TIME A JOB HAS TAKEN HIM AS

SMITHTHERE IS A BOATMAN HERE WITH A WHERRY WATSON WE SHALL TAKE

I WOULD ENGAGE A LAUNCH AND GO DOWN THE RIVER ON THE TRACK OF THE
AURORA
MY DEAR FELLOW IT WOULD BE A COLOSSAL TASK SHE MAY HAVE TOUCHED AT
ANY WHARF ON EITHER SIDE OF THE STREAM BETWEEN HERE AND GREENWICH
BELOW THE BRIDGE THERE IS A PERFECT LABYRINTH OF LANDINGPLACES FOR
MILES IT WOULD TAKE YOU DAYS AND DAYS TO EXHAUST THEM IF YOU SET
ABOUT IT ALONE
EMPLOY THE POLICE THEN
NO I SHALL PROBABLY CALL ATHELNEY JONES IN AT THE LAST MOMENT HE
IS NOT A BAD FELLOW AND I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING WHICH WOULD
INJURE HIM PROFESSIONALLY BUT I HAVE A FANCY FOR WORKING IT OUT
MYSELF NOW THAT WE HAVE GONE SO FAR
COULD WE ADVERTISE THEN ASKING FOR INFORMATION FROM WHARFINGERS
WORSE AND WORSE OUR MEN WOULD KNOW THAT THE CHASE WAS HOT AT THEIR
HEELS AND THEY WOULD BE OFF OUT OF THE COUNTRY AS IT IS THEY ARE
LIKELY ENOUGH TO LEAVE BUT AS LONG AS THEY THINK THEY ARE PERFECTLY
SAFE THEY WILL BE IN NO HURRY JONESS ENERGY WILL BE OF USE TO US
THERE FOR HIS VIEW OF THE CASE IS SURE TO PUSH ITSELF INTO THE DAILY
PRESS AND THE RUNAWAYS WILL THINK THAT EVERY ONE IS OFF ON THE WRONG
SCENT
WHAT ARE WE TO DO THEN I ASKED AS WE LANDED NEAR MILLBANK
PENITENTIARY
TAKE THIS HANSOM DRIVE HOME HAVE SOME BREAKFAST AND GET AN HOURS
SLEEP IT IS QUITE ON THE CARDS THAT WE MAY BE AFOOT TONIGHT AGAIN
STOP AT A TELEGRAPHOFFICE CABBY WE WILL KEEP TOBY FOR HE MAY BE
OF USE TO US YET
WE PULLED UP AT THE GREAT PETER STREET POSTOFFICE AND HOLMES
DESPATCHED HIS WIRE WHOM DO YOU THINK THAT IS TO HE ASKED AS WE
RESUMED OUR JOURNEY
I AM SURE I DONT KNOW
YOU REMEMBER THE BAKER STREET DIVISION OF THE DETECTIVE POLICE FORCE
WHOM I EMPLOYED IN THE JEFFERSON HOPE CASE
WELL SAID I LAUGHING
THIS IS JUST THE CASE WHERE THEY MIGHT BE INVALUABLE IF THEY FAIL
I HAVE OTHER RESOURCES BUT I SHALL TRY THEM FIRST THAT WIRE WAS TO
MY DIRTY LITTLE LIEUTENANT WIGGINS AND I EXPECT THAT HE AND HIS
GANG WILL BE WITH US BEFORE WE HAVE FINISHED OUR BREAKFAST
IT WAS BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE OCLOCK NOW AND I WAS CONSCIOUS OF A
STRONG REACTION AFTER THE SUCCESSIVE EXCITEMENTS OF THE NIGHT I WAS
LIMP AND WEARY BEFOGGED IN MIND AND FATIGUED IN BODY I HAD NOT THE
PROFESSIONAL ENTHUSIASM WHICH CARRIED MY COMPANION ON NOR COULD I
LOOK AT THE MATTER AS A MERE ABSTRACT INTELLECTUAL PROBLEM AS FAR AS
THE DEATH OF BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTO WENT I HAD HEARD LITTLE GOOD OF HIM
AND COULD FEEL NO INTENSE ANTIPATHY TO HIS MURDERERS THE TREASURE
HOWEVER WAS A DIFFERENT MATTER THAT OR PART OF IT BELONGED
RIGHTFULLY TO MISS MORSTAN WHILE THERE WAS A CHANCE OF RECOVERING IT
I WAS READY TO DEVOTE MY LIFE TO THE ONE OBJECT TRUE IF I FOUND IT
IT WOULD PROBABLY PUT HER FOREVER BEYOND MY REACH YET IT WOULD BE A
PETTY AND SELFISH LOVE WHICH WOULD BE INFLUENCED BY SUCH A THOUGHT AS
THAT IF HOLMES COULD WORK TO FIND THE CRIMINALS I HAD A TENFOLD
STRONGER REASON TO URGE ME ON TO FIND THE TREASURE
A BATH AT BAKER STREET AND A COMPLETE CHANGE FRESHENED ME UP
WONDERFULLY WHEN I CAME DOWN TO OUR ROOM I FOUND THE BREAKFAST LAID
AND HOLMES POURING OUT THE COFFEE
HERE IT IS SAID HE LAUGHING AND POINTING TO AN OPEN NEWSPAPER
THE ENERGETIC JONES AND THE UBIQUITOUS REPORTER HAVE FIXED IT UP
BETWEEN THEM BUT YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THE CASE BETTER HAVE YOUR
HAM AND EGGS FIRST
I TOOK THE PAPER FROM HIM AND READ THE SHORT NOTICE WHICH WAS HEADED
MYSTERIOUS BUSINESS AT UPPER NORWOOD
ABOUT TWELVE OCLOCK LAST NIGHT SAID THE STANDARD MR
BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTO OF PONDICHERRY LODGE UPPER NORWOOD WAS FOUND
DEAD IN HIS ROOM UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH POINT TO FOUL PLAY AS FAR
AS WE CAN LEARN NO ACTUAL TRACES OF VIOLENCE WERE FOUND UPON MR
SHOLTOS PERSON BUT A VALUABLE COLLECTION OF INDIAN GEMS WHICH THE
DECEASED GENTLEMAN HAD INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER HAS BEEN CARRIED
OFF THE DISCOVERY WAS FIRST MADE BY MR SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR
WATSON WHO HAD CALLED AT THE HOUSE WITH MR THADDEUS SHOLTO BROTHER
OF THE DECEASED BY A SINGULAR PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE MR ATHELNEY
JONES THE WELLKNOWN MEMBER OF THE DETECTIVE POLICE FORCE HAPPENED
TO BE AT THE NORWOOD POLICE STATION AND WAS ON THE GROUND WITHIN
HALF AN HOUR OF THE FIRST ALARM HIS TRAINED AND EXPERIENCED
FACULTIES WERE AT ONCE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE DETECTION OF THE
CRIMINALS WITH THE GRATIFYING RESULT THAT THE BROTHER THADDEUS
SHOLTO HAS ALREADY BEEN ARRESTED TOGETHER WITH THE HOUSEKEEPER
MRS BERNSTONE AN INDIAN BUTLER NAMED LAL RAO AND A PORTER OR
GATEKEEPER NAMED MCMURDO IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE THIEF OR
THIEVES WERE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOUSE FOR MR JONESS
WELLKNOWN TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE AND HIS POWERS OF MINUTE OBSERVATION
HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PROVE CONCLUSIVELY THAT THE MISCREANTS COULD NOT
HAVE ENTERED BY THE DOOR OR BY THE WINDOW BUT MUST HAVE MADE THEIR
WAY ACROSS THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING AND SO THROUGH A TRAPDOOR INTO
A ROOM WHICH COMMUNICATED WITH THAT IN WHICH THE BODY WAS FOUND THIS
FACT WHICH HAS BEEN VERY CLEARLY MADE OUT PROVES CONCLUSIVELY THAT
IT WAS NO MERE HAPHAZARD BURGLARY THE PROMPT AND ENERGETIC ACTION OF
THE OFFICERS OF THE LAW SHOWS THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF THE PRESENCE ON
SUCH OCCASIONS OF A SINGLE VIGOROUS AND MASTERFUL MIND WE CANNOT BUT
THINK THAT IT SUPPLIES AN ARGUMENT TO THOSE WHO WOULD WISH TO SEE OUR
DETECTIVES MORE DECENTRALIZED AND SO BROUGHT INTO CLOSER AND MORE
EFFECTIVE TOUCH WITH THE CASES WHICH IT IS THEIR DUTY TO
INVESTIGATE
ISNT IT GORGEOUS SAID HOLMES GRINNING OVER HIS COFFEECUP WHAT
DO YOU THINK OF IT
I THINK THAT WE HAVE HAD A CLOSE SHAVE OURSELVES OF BEING ARRESTED
FOR THE CRIME
SO DO I I WOULDNT ANSWER FOR OUR SAFETY NOW IF HE SHOULD HAPPEN
TO HAVE ANOTHER OF HIS ATTACKS OF ENERGY
AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A LOUD RING AT THE BELL AND I COULD HEAR
MRS HUDSON OUR LANDLADY RAISING HER VOICE IN A WAIL OF
EXPOSTULATION AND DISMAY
BY HEAVEN HOLMES I SAID HALF RISING I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE
REALLY AFTER US
NO ITS NOT QUITE SO BAD AS THAT IT IS THE UNOFFICIAL FORCETHE
BAKER STREET IRREGULARS
AS HE SPOKE THERE CAME A SWIFT PATTERING OF NAKED FEET UPON THE
STAIRS A CLATTER OF HIGH VOICES AND IN RUSHED A DOZEN DIRTY AND
RAGGED LITTLE STREETARABS THERE WAS SOME SHOW OF DISCIPLINE AMONG
THEM DESPITE THEIR TUMULTUOUS ENTRY FOR THEY INSTANTLY DREW UP IN
LINE AND STOOD FACING US WITH EXPECTANT FACES ONE OF THEIR NUMBER
TALLER AND OLDER THAN THE OTHERS STOOD FORWARD WITH AN AIR OF
LOUNGING SUPERIORITY WHICH WAS VERY FUNNY IN SUCH A DISREPUTABLE
LITTLE CARECROW
GOT YOUR MESSAGE SIR SAID HE AND BROUGHT EM ON SHARP THREE
BOB AND A TANNER FOR TICKETS
HERE YOU ARE SAID HOLMES PRODUCING SOME SILVER IN FUTURE THEY
CAN REPORT TO YOU WIGGINS AND YOU TO ME I CANNOT HAVE THE HOUSE
INVADED IN THIS WAY HOWEVER IT IS JUST AS WELL THAT YOU SHOULD ALL
HEAR THE INSTRUCTIONS I WANT TO FIND THE WHEREABOUTS OF A STEAM
LAUNCH CALLED THE AURORA OWNER MORDECAI SMITH BLACK WITH TWO RED
STREAKS FUNNEL BLACK WITH A WHITE BAND SHE IS DOWN THE RIVER
SOMEWHERE I WANT ONE BOY TO BE AT MORDECAI SMITHS LANDINGSTAGE
OPPOSITE MILLBANK TO SAY IF THE BOAT COMES BACK YOU MUST DIVIDE IT
OUT AMONG YOURSELVES AND DO BOTH BANKS THOROUGHLY LET ME KNOW THE
MOMENT YOU HAVE NEWS IS THAT ALL CLEAR
YES GUVNOR SAID WIGGINS
THE OLD SCALE OF PAY AND A GUINEA TO THE BOY WHO FINDS THE BOAT
HERES A DAY IN ADVANCE NOW OFF YOU GO HE HANDED THEM A SHILLING
EACH AND AWAY THEY BUZZED DOWN THE STAIRS AND I SAW THEM A MOMENT
LATER STREAMING DOWN THE STREET
IF THE LAUNCH IS ABOVE WATER THEY WILL FIND HER SAID HOLMES AS HE
ROSE FROM THE TABLE AND LIT HIS PIPE THEY CAN GO EVERYWHERE SEE
EVERYTHING OVERHEAR EVERY ONE I EXPECT TO HEAR BEFORE EVENING THAT
THEY HAVE SPOTTED HER IN THE MEAN WHILE WE CAN DO NOTHING BUT AWAIT
RESULTS WE CANNOT PICK UP THE BROKEN TRAIL UNTIL WE FIND EITHER THE
AURORA OR MR MORDECAI SMITH
TOBY COULD EAT THESE SCRAPS I DARE SAY ARE YOU GOING TO BED
HOLMES
NO I AM NOT TIRED I HAVE A CURIOUS CONSTITUTION I NEVER REMEMBER
FEELING TIRED BY WORK THOUGH IDLENESS EXHAUSTS ME COMPLETELY I AM
GOING TO SMOKE AND TO THINK OVER THIS QUEER BUSINESS TO WHICH MY FAIR
CLIENT HAS INTRODUCED US IF EVER MAN HAD AN EASY TASK THIS OF OURS
OUGHT TO BE WOODENLEGGED MEN ARE NOT SO COMMON BUT THE OTHER MAN
MUST I SHOULD THINK BE ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE
THAT OTHER MAN AGAIN
I HAVE NO WISH TO MAKE A MYSTERY OF HIMTO YOU ANYWAY BUT YOU
MUST HAVE FORMED YOUR OWN OPINION NOW DO CONSIDER THE DATA
DIMINUTIVE FOOTMARKS TOES NEVER FETTERED BY BOOTS NAKED FEET
STONEHEADED WOODEN MACE GREAT AGILITY SMALL POISONED DARTS WHAT
DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THIS
A SAVAGE I EXCLAIMED PERHAPS ONE OF THOSE INDIANS WHO WERE THE
ASSOCIATES OF JONATHAN SMALL
HARDLY THAT SAID HE WHEN FIRST I SAW SIGNS OF STRANGE WEAPONS I
WAS INCLINED TO THINK SO BUT THE REMARKABLE CHARACTER OF THE
FOOTMARKS CAUSED ME TO RECONSIDER MY VIEWS SOME OF THE INHABITANTS
OF THE INDIAN PENINSULA ARE SMALL MEN BUT NONE COULD HAVE LEFT SUCH
MARKS AS THAT THE HINDOO PROPER HAS LONG AND THIN FEET THE
SANDALWEARING MOHAMMEDAN HAS THE GREAT TOE WELL SEPARATED FROM THE
OTHERS BECAUSE THE THONG IS COMMONLY PASSED BETWEEN THESE LITTLE
DARTS TOO COULD ONLY BE SHOT IN ONE WAY THEY ARE FROM A BLOWPIPE
NOW THEN WHERE ARE WE TO FIND OUR SAVAGE
SOUTH AMERICAN I HAZARDED
HE STRETCHED HIS HAND UP AND TOOK DOWN A BULKY VOLUME FROM THE
SHELF THIS IS THE FIRST VOLUME OF A GAZETTEER WHICH IS NOW BEING
PUBLISHED IT MAY BE LOOKED UPON AS THE VERY LATEST AUTHORITY WHAT
HAVE WE HERE ANDAMAN ISLANDS SITUATED MILES TO THE NORTH OF
SUMATRA IN THE BAY OF BENGAL HUM HUM WHATS ALL THIS MOIST
CLIMATE CORAL REEFS SHARKS PORT BLAIR CONVICTBARRACKS RUTLAND
ISLAND COTTONWOODSAH HERE WE ARE THE ABORIGINES OF THE ANDAMAN
ISLANDS MAY PERHAPS CLAIM THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE SMALLEST RACE
UPON THIS EARTH THOUGH SOME ANTHROPOLOGISTS PREFER THE BUSHMEN OF
AFRICA THE DIGGER INDIANS OF AMERICA AND THE TERRA DEL FUEGIANS
THE AVERAGE HEIGHT IS RATHER BELOW FOUR FEET ALTHOUGH MANY
FULLGROWN ADULTS MAY BE FOUND WHO ARE VERY MUCH SMALLER THAN THIS
THEY ARE A FIERCE MOROSE AND INTRACTABLE PEOPLE THOUGH CAPABLE OF
FORMING MOST DEVOTED FRIENDSHIPS WHEN THEIR CONFIDENCE HAS ONCE BEEN
GAINED MARK THAT WATSON NOW THEN LISTEN TO THIS THEY ARE
NATURALLY HIDEOUS HAVING LARGE MISSHAPEN HEADS SMALL FIERCE EYES
AND DISTORTED FEATURES THEIR FEET AND HANDS HOWEVER ARE REMARKABLY
SMALL SO INTRACTABLE AND FIERCE ARE THEY THAT ALL THE EFFORTS OF THE
BRITISH OFFICIAL HAVE FAILED TO WIN THEM OVER IN ANY DEGREE THEY
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A TERROR TO SHIPWRECKED CREWS BRAINING THE
SURVIVORS WITH THEIR STONEHEADED CLUBS OR SHOOTING THEM WITH THEIR
POISONED ARROWS THESE MASSACRES ARE INVARIABLY CONCLUDED BY A
CANNIBAL FEAST NICE AMIABLE PEOPLE WATSON IF THIS FELLOW HAD
BEEN LEFT TO HIS OWN UNAIDED DEVICES THIS AFFAIR MIGHT HAVE TAKEN AN
EVEN MORE GHASTLY TURN I FANCY THAT EVEN AS IT IS JONATHAN SMALL
WOULD GIVE A GOOD DEAL NOT TO HAVE EMPLOYED HIM
BUT HOW CAME HE TO HAVE SO SINGULAR A COMPANION
AH THAT IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL SINCE HOWEVER WE HAD ALREADY
DETERMINED THAT SMALL HAD COME FROM THE ANDAMANS IT IS NOT SO VERY
WONDERFUL THAT THIS ISLANDER SHOULD BE WITH HIM NO DOUBT WE SHALL
KNOW ALL ABOUT IT IN TIME LOOK HERE WATSON YOU LOOK REGULARLY
DONE LIE DOWN THERE ON THE SOFA AND SEE IF I CAN PUT YOU TO SLEEP
HE TOOK UP HIS VIOLIN FROM THE CORNER AND AS I STRETCHED MYSELF OUT
HE BEGAN TO PLAY SOME LOW DREAMY MELODIOUS AIRHIS OWN NO DOUBT
FOR HE HAD A REMARKABLE GIFT FOR IMPROVISATION I HAVE A VAGUE
REMEMBRANCE OF HIS GAUNT LIMBS HIS EARNEST FACE AND THE RISE AND
FALL OF HIS BOW THEN I SEEMED TO BE FLOATED PEACEFULLY AWAY UPON A
SOFT SEA OF SOUND UNTIL I FOUND MYSELF IN DREAMLAND WITH THE SWEET
FACE OF MARY MORSTAN LOOKING DOWN UPON ME
CHAPTER IX
A BREAK IN THE CHAIN
IT WAS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON BEFORE I WOKE STRENGTHENED AND
REFRESHED SHERLOCK HOLMES STILL SAT EXACTLY AS I HAD LEFT HIM SAVE
THAT HE HAD LAID ASIDE HIS VIOLIN AND WAS DEEP IN A BOOK HE LOOKED
ACROSS AT ME AS I STIRRED AND I NOTICED THAT HIS FACE WAS DARK AND
TROUBLED
YOU HAVE SLEPT SOUNDLY HE SAID I FEARED THAT OUR TALK WOULD WAKE
YOU
I HEARD NOTHING I ANSWERED HAVE YOU HAD FRESH NEWS THEN
UNFORTUNATELY NO I CONFESS THAT I AM SURPRISED AND DISAPPOINTED I
EXPECTED SOMETHING DEFINITE BY THIS TIME WIGGINS HAS JUST BEEN UP
TO REPORT HE SAYS THAT NO TRACE CAN BE FOUND OF THE LAUNCH IT IS A
PROVOKING CHECK FOR EVERY HOUR IS OF IMPORTANCE
CAN I DO ANYTHING I AM PERFECTLY FRESH NOW AND QUITE READY FOR
ANOTHER NIGHTS OUTING
NO WE CAN DO NOTHING WE CAN ONLY WAIT IF WE GO OURSELVES THE
MESSAGE MIGHT COME IN OUR ABSENCE AND DELAY BE CAUSED YOU CAN DO
WHAT YOU WILL BUT I MUST REMAIN ON GUARD
THEN I SHALL RUN OVER TO CAMBERWELL AND CALL UPON MRS CECIL
FORRESTER SHE ASKED ME TO YESTERDAY
ON MRS CECIL FORRESTER ASKED HOLMES WITH THE TWINKLE OF A SMILE
IN HIS EYES
WELL OF COURSE MISS MORSTAN TOO THEY WERE ANXIOUS TO HEAR WHAT
HAPPENED
I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH SAID HOLMES WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE
ENTIRELY TRUSTEDNOT THE BEST OF THEM
I DID NOT PAUSE TO ARGUE OVER THIS ATROCIOUS SENTIMENT I SHALL BE
BACK IN AN HOUR OR TWO I REMARKED
ALL RIGHT GOOD LUCK BUT I SAY IF YOU ARE CROSSING THE RIVER YOU
MAY AS WELL RETURN TOBY FOR I DONT THINK IT IS AT ALL LIKELY THAT
WE SHALL HAVE ANY USE FOR HIM NOW
I TOOK OUR MONGREL ACCORDINGLY AND LEFT HIM TOGETHER WITH A
HALFSOVEREIGN AT THE OLD NATURALISTS IN PINCHIN LANE AT
CAMBERWELL I FOUND MISS MORSTAN A LITTLE WEARY AFTER HER NIGHTS
ADVENTURES BUT VERY EAGER TO HEAR THE NEWS MRS FORRESTER TOO WAS
FULL OF CURIOSITY I TOLD THEM ALL THAT WE HAD DONE SUPPRESSING
HOWEVER THE MORE DREADFUL PARTS OF THE TRAGEDY THUS ALTHOUGH I
SPOKE OF MR SHOLTOS DEATH I SAID NOTHING OF THE EXACT MANNER AND
METHOD OF IT WITH ALL MY OMISSIONS HOWEVER THERE WAS ENOUGH TO
STARTLE AND AMAZE THEM
IT IS A ROMANCE CRIED MRS FORRESTER AN INJURED LADY HALF A
MILLION IN TREASURE A BLACK CANNIBAL AND A WOODENLEGGED RUFFIAN
THEY TAKE THE PLACE OF THE CONVENTIONAL DRAGON OR WICKED EARL
AND TWO KNIGHTERRANTS TO THE RESCUE ADDED MISS MORSTAN WITH A
BRIGHT GLANCE AT ME
WHY MARY YOUR FORTUNE DEPENDS UPON THE ISSUE OF THIS SEARCH I
DONT THINK THAT YOU ARE NEARLY EXCITED ENOUGH JUST IMAGINE WHAT IT
MUST BE TO BE SO RICH AND TO HAVE THE WORLD AT YOUR FEET
IT SENT A LITTLE THRILL OF JOY TO MY HEART TO NOTICE THAT SHE SHOWED
NO SIGN OF ELATION AT THE PROSPECT ON THE CONTRARY SHE GAVE A TOSS
OF HER PROUD HEAD AS THOUGH THE MATTER WERE ONE IN WHICH SHE TOOK
SMALL INTEREST
IT IS FOR MR THADDEUS SHOLTO THAT I AM ANXIOUS SHE SAID NOTHING
ELSE IS OF ANY CONSEQUENCE BUT I THINK THAT HE HAS BEHAVED MOST
KINDLY AND HONORABLY THROUGHOUT IT IS OUR DUTY TO CLEAR HIM OF THIS
DREADFUL AND UNFOUNDED CHARGE
IT WAS EVENING BEFORE I LEFT CAMBERWELL AND QUITE DARK BY THE TIME I
REACHED HOME MY COMPANIONS BOOK AND PIPE LAY BY HIS CHAIR BUT HE
HAD DISAPPEARED I LOOKED ABOUT IN THE HOPE OF SEEING A NOTE BUT
THERE WAS NONE
I SUPPOSE THAT MR SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS GONE OUT I SAID TO MRS HUDSON AS
SHE CAME UP TO LOWER THE BLINDS
NO SIR HE HAS GONE TO HIS ROOM SIR DO YOU KNOW SIR SINKING
HER VOICE INTO AN IMPRESSIVE WHISPER I AM AFRAID FOR HIS HEALTH
WHY SO MRS HUDSON
WELL HES THAT STRANGE SIR AFTER YOU WAS GONE HE WALKED AND HE
WALKED UP AND DOWN AND UP AND DOWN UNTIL I WAS WEARY OF THE SOUND
OF HIS FOOTSTEP THEN I HEARD HIM TALKING TO HIMSELF AND MUTTERING
AND EVERY TIME THE BELL RANG OUT HE CAME ON THE STAIRHEAD WITH WHAT
IS THAT MRS HUDSON AND NOW HE HAS SLAMMED OFF TO HIS ROOM BUT I
CAN HEAR HIM WALKING AWAY THE SAME AS EVER I HOPE HES NOT GOING TO
BE ILL SIR I VENTURED TO SAY SOMETHING TO HIM ABOUT COOLING
MEDICINE BUT HE TURNED ON ME SIR WITH SUCH A LOOK THAT I DONT
KNOW HOW EVER I GOT OUT OF THE ROOM
I DONT THINK THAT YOU HAVE ANY CAUSE TO BE UNEASY MRS HUDSON I
ANSWERED I HAVE SEEN HIM LIKE THIS BEFORE HE HAS SOME SMALL MATTER
UPON HIS MIND WHICH MAKES HIM RESTLESS I TRIED TO SPEAK LIGHTLY TO
OUR WORTHY LANDLADY BUT I WAS MYSELF SOMEWHAT UNEASY WHEN THROUGH
THE LONG NIGHT I STILL FROM TIME TO TIME HEARD THE DULL SOUND OF HIS
TREAD AND KNEW HOW HIS KEEN SPIRIT WAS CHAFING AGAINST THIS
INVOLUNTARY INACTION
AT BREAKFASTTIME HE LOOKED WORN AND HAGGARD WITH A LITTLE FLECK OF
FEVERISH COLOR UPON EITHER CHEEK
YOU ARE KNOCKING YOURSELF UP OLD MAN I REMARKED I HEARD YOU
MARCHING ABOUT IN THE NIGHT
NO I COULD NOT SLEEP HE ANSWERED THIS INFERNAL PROBLEM IS
CONSUMING ME IT IS TOO MUCH TO BE BALKED BY SO PETTY AN OBSTACLE
WHEN ALL ELSE HAD BEEN OVERCOME I KNOW THE MEN THE LAUNCH
EVERYTHING AND YET I CAN GET NO NEWS I HAVE SET OTHER AGENCIES AT
WORK AND USED EVERY MEANS AT MY DISPOSAL THE WHOLE RIVER HAS BEEN
SEARCHED ON EITHER SIDE BUT THERE IS NO NEWS NOR HAS MRS SMITH
HEARD OF HER HUSBAND I SHALL COME TO THE CONCLUSION SOON THAT THEY
HAVE SCUTTLED THE CRAFT BUT THERE ARE OBJECTIONS TO THAT
OR THAT MRS SMITH HAS PUT US ON A WRONG SCENT
NO I THINK THAT MAY BE DISMISSED I HAD INQUIRIES MADE AND THERE
IS A LAUNCH OF THAT DESCRIPTION
COULD IT HAVE GONE UP THE RIVER
I HAVE CONSIDERED THAT POSSIBILITY TOO AND THERE IS A SEARCHPARTY
WHO WILL WORK UP AS FAR AS RICHMOND IF NO NEWS COMES TODAY I SHALL
START OFF MYSELF TOMORROW AND GO FOR THE MEN RATHER THAN THE BOAT
BUT SURELY SURELY WE SHALL HEAR SOMETHING
WE DID NOT HOWEVER NOT A WORD CAME TO US EITHER FROM WIGGINS OR
FROM THE OTHER AGENCIES THERE WERE ARTICLES IN MOST OF THE PAPERS
UPON THE NORWOOD TRAGEDY THEY ALL APPEARED TO BE RATHER HOSTILE TO
THE UNFORTUNATE THADDEUS SHOLTO NO FRESH DETAILS WERE TO BE FOUND
HOWEVER IN ANY OF THEM SAVE THAT AN INQUEST WAS TO BE HELD UPON THE
FOLLOWING DAY I WALKED OVER TO CAMBERWELL IN THE EVENING TO REPORT
OUR ILL SUCCESS TO THE LADIES AND ON MY RETURN I FOUND HOLMES
DEJECTED AND SOMEWHAT MOROSE HE WOULD HARDLY REPLY TO MY QUESTIONS
AND BUSIED HIMSELF ALL EVENING IN AN ABSTRUSE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS WHICH
INVOLVED MUCH HEATING OF RETORTS AND DISTILLING OF VAPORS ENDING AT
LAST IN A SMELL WHICH FAIRLY DROVE ME OUT OF THE APARTMENT UP TO THE
SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING I COULD HEAR THE CLINKING OF HIS
TESTTUBES WHICH TOLD ME THAT HE WAS STILL ENGAGED IN HIS MALODOROUS
EXPERIMENT
IN THE EARLY DAWN I WOKE WITH A START AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND HIM
STANDING BY MY BEDSIDE CLAD IN A RUDE SAILOR DRESS WITH A
PEAJACKET AND A COARSE RED SCARF ROUND HIS NECK
I AM OFF DOWN THE RIVER WATSON SAID HE I HAVE BEEN TURNING IT
OVER IN MY MIND AND I CAN SEE ONLY ONE WAY OUT OF IT IT IS WORTH
TRYING AT ALL EVENTS
SURELY I CAN COME WITH YOU THEN SAID I
NO YOU CAN BE MUCH MORE USEFUL IF YOU WILL REMAIN HERE AS MY
REPRESENTATIVE I AM LOATH TO GO FOR IT IS QUITE ON THE CARDS THAT
SOME MESSAGE MAY COME DURING THE DAY THOUGH WIGGINS WAS DESPONDENT
ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT I WANT YOU TO OPEN ALL NOTES AND TELEGRAMS AND
TO ACT ON YOUR OWN JUDGMENT IF ANY NEWS SHOULD COME CAN I RELY UPON
YOU
MOST CERTAINLY
I AM AFRAID THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WIRE TO ME FOR I CAN
HARDLY TELL YET WHERE I MAY FIND MYSELF IF I AM IN LUCK HOWEVER I
MAY NOT BE GONE SO VERY LONG I SHALL HAVE NEWS OF SOME SORT OR OTHER
BEFORE I GET BACK
I HAD HEARD NOTHING OF HIM BY BREAKFASTTIME ON OPENING THE
STANDARD HOWEVER I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A FRESH ALLUSION TO THE
BUSINESS
WITH REFERENCE TO THE UPPER NORWOOD TRAGEDY IT REMARKED WE HAVE
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE MATTER PROMISES TO BE EVEN MORE COMPLEX
AND MYSTERIOUS THAN WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED FRESH EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN
THAT IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE THAT MR THADDEUS SHOLTO COULD HAVE BEEN
IN ANY WAY CONCERNED IN THE MATTER HE AND THE HOUSEKEEPER MRS
BERNSTONE WERE BOTH RELEASED YESTERDAY EVENING IT IS BELIEVED
HOWEVER THAT THE POLICE HAVE A CLUE AS TO THE REAL CULPRITS AND
THAT IT IS BEING PROSECUTED BY MR ATHELNEY JONES OF SCOTLAND YARD
WITH ALL HIS WELLKNOWN ENERGY AND SAGACITY FURTHER ARRESTS MAY BE
EXPECTED AT ANY MOMENT
THAT IS SATISFACTORY SO FAR AS IT GOES THOUGHT I FRIEND SHOLTO
IS SAFE AT ANY RATE I WONDER WHAT THE FRESH CLUE MAY BE THOUGH IT
SEEMS TO BE A STEREOTYPED FORM WHENEVER THE POLICE HAVE MADE A
BLUNDER
I TOSSED THE PAPER DOWN UPON THE TABLE BUT AT THAT MOMENT MY EYE
CAUGHT AN ADVERTISEMENT IN THE AGONY COLUMN IT RAN IN THIS WAY
LOSTWHEREAS MORDECAI SMITH BOATMAN AND HIS SON JIM LEFT
SMITHS WHARF AT OR ABOUT THREE OCLOCK LAST TUESDAY MORNING IN THE
STEAM LAUNCH AURORA BLACK WITH TWO RED STRIPES FUNNEL BLACK WITH A
WHITE BAND THE SUM OF FIVE POUNDS WILL BE PAID TO ANY ONE WHO CAN
GIVE INFORMATION TO MRS SMITH AT SMITHS WHARF OR AT B BAKER
STREET AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE SAID MORDECAI SMITH AND THE
LAUNCH AURORA
THIS WAS CLEARLY HOLMESS DOING THE BAKER STREET ADDRESS WAS ENOUGH
TO PROVE THAT IT STRUCK ME AS RATHER INGENIOUS BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE
READ BY THE FUGITIVES WITHOUT THEIR SEEING IN IT MORE THAN THE
NATURAL ANXIETY OF A WIFE FOR HER MISSING HUSBAND
IT WAS A LONG DAY EVERY TIME THAT A KNOCK CAME TO THE DOOR OR A
SHARP STEP PASSED IN THE STREET I IMAGINED THAT IT WAS EITHER HOLMES
RETURNING OR AN ANSWER TO HIS ADVERTISEMENT I TRIED TO READ BUT MY
THOUGHTS WOULD WANDER OFF TO OUR STRANGE QUEST AND TO THE
ILLASSORTED AND VILLAINOUS PAIR WHOM WE WERE PURSUING COULD THERE
BE I WONDERED SOME RADICAL FLAW IN MY COMPANIONS REASONING MIGHT
HE BE SUFFERING FROM SOME HUGE SELFDECEPTION WAS IT NOT POSSIBLE
THAT HIS NIMBLE AND SPECULATIVE MIND HAD BUILT UP THIS WILD THEORY
UPON FAULTY PREMISES I HAD NEVER KNOWN HIM TO BE WRONG AND YET THE
KEENEST REASONER MAY OCCASIONALLY BE DECEIVED HE WAS LIKELY I
THOUGHT TO FALL INTO ERROR THROUGH THE OVERREFINEMENT OF HIS
LOGICHIS PREFERENCE FOR A SUBTLE AND BIZARRE EXPLANATION WHEN A
PLAINER AND MORE COMMONPLACE ONE LAY READY TO HIS HAND YET ON THE
OTHER HAND I HAD MYSELF SEEN THE EVIDENCE AND I HAD HEARD THE
REASONS FOR HIS DEDUCTIONS WHEN I LOOKED BACK ON THE LONG CHAIN OF
CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES MANY OF THEM TRIVIAL IN THEMSELVES BUT ALL
TENDING IN THE SAME DIRECTION I COULD NOT DISGUISE FROM MYSELF THAT
EVEN IF HOLMESS EXPLANATION WERE INCORRECT THE TRUE THEORY MUST BE
EQUALLY OUTR AND STARTLING
AT THREE OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THERE WAS A LOUD PEAL AT THE BELL
AN AUTHORITATIVE VOICE IN THE HALL AND TO MY SURPRISE NO LESS A
PERSON THAN MR ATHELNEY JONES WAS SHOWN UP TO ME VERY DIFFERENT WAS
HE HOWEVER FROM THE BRUSQUE AND MASTERFUL PROFESSOR OF COMMON SENSE
WHO HAD TAKEN OVER THE CASE SO CONFIDENTLY AT UPPER NORWOOD HIS
EXPRESSION WAS DOWNCAST AND HIS BEARING MEEK AND EVEN APOLOGETIC
GOODDAY SIR GOODDAY SAID HE MR SHERLOCK HOLMES IS OUT I
UNDERSTAND
YES AND I CANNOT BE SURE WHEN HE WILL BE BACK BUT PERHAPS YOU
WOULD CARE TO WAIT TAKE THAT CHAIR AND TRY ONE OF THESE CIGARS
THANK YOU I DONT MIND IF I DO SAID HE MOPPING HIS FACE WITH A
RED BANDANNA HANDKERCHIEF
AND A WHISKEYANDSODA
WELL HALF A GLASS IT IS VERY HOT FOR THE TIME OF YEAR AND I HAVE
HAD A GOOD DEAL TO WORRY AND TRY ME YOU KNOW MY THEORY ABOUT THIS
NORWOOD CASE
I REMEMBER THAT YOU EXPRESSED ONE
WELL I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO RECONSIDER IT I HAD MY NET DRAWN
TIGHTLY ROUND MR SHOLTO SIR WHEN POP HE WENT THROUGH A HOLE IN THE
MIDDLE OF IT HE WAS ABLE TO PROVE AN ALIBI WHICH COULD NOT BE
SHAKEN FROM THE TIME THAT HE LEFT HIS BROTHERS ROOM HE WAS NEVER
OUT OF SIGHT OF SOME ONE OR OTHER SO IT COULD NOT BE HE WHO CLIMBED
OVER ROOFS AND THROUGH TRAPDOORS ITS A VERY DARK CASE AND MY
PROFESSIONAL CREDIT IS AT STAKE I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD OF A LITTLE
ASSISTANCE
WE ALL NEED HELP SOMETIMES SAID I
YOUR FRIEND MR SHERLOCK HOLMES IS A WONDERFUL MAN SIR SAID HE
IN A HUSKY AND CONFIDENTIAL VOICE HES A MAN WHO IS NOT TO BE BEAT
I HAVE KNOWN THAT YOUNG MAN GO INTO A GOOD MANY CASES BUT I NEVER
SAW THE CASE YET THAT HE COULD NOT THROW A LIGHT UPON HE IS
IRREGULAR IN HIS METHODS AND A LITTLE QUICK PERHAPS IN JUMPING AT
THEORIES BUT ON THE WHOLE I THINK HE WOULD HAVE MADE A MOST
PROMISING OFFICER AND I DONT CARE WHO KNOWS IT I HAVE HAD A WIRE
FROM HIM THIS MORNING BY WHICH I UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS GOT SOME
CLUE TO THIS SHOLTO BUSINESS HERE IS THE MESSAGE
HE TOOK THE TELEGRAM OUT OF HIS POCKET AND HANDED IT TO ME IT WAS
DATED FROM POPLAR AT TWELVE OCLOCK GO TO BAKER STREET AT ONCE IT
SAID IF I HAVE NOT RETURNED WAIT FOR ME I AM CLOSE ON THE TRACK
OF THE SHOLTO GANG YOU CAN COME WITH US TONIGHT IF YOU WANT TO BE
IN AT THE FINISH
THIS SOUNDS WELL HE HAS EVIDENTLY PICKED UP THE SCENT AGAIN SAID
I
AH THEN HE HAS BEEN AT FAULT TOO EXCLAIMED JONES WITH EVIDENT
SATISFACTION EVEN THE BEST OF US ARE THROWN OFF SOMETIMES OF
COURSE THIS MAY PROVE TO BE A FALSE ALARM BUT IT IS MY DUTY AS AN
OFFICER OF THE LAW TO ALLOW NO CHANCE TO SLIP BUT THERE IS SOME ONE
AT THE DOOR PERHAPS THIS IS HE
A HEAVY STEP WAS HEARD ASCENDING THE STAIR WITH A GREAT WHEEZING AND
RATTLING AS FROM A MAN WHO WAS SORELY PUT TO IT FOR BREATH ONCE OR
TWICE HE STOPPED AS THOUGH THE CLIMB WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIM BUT AT
LAST HE MADE HIS WAY TO OUR DOOR AND ENTERED HIS APPEARANCE
CORRESPONDED TO THE SOUNDS WHICH WE HAD HEARD HE WAS AN AGED MAN
CLAD IN SEAFARING GARB WITH AN OLD PEAJACKET BUTTONED UP TO HIS
THROAT HIS BACK WAS BOWED HIS KNEES WERE SHAKY AND HIS BREATHING
WAS PAINFULLY ASTHMATIC AS HE LEANED UPON A THICK OAKEN CUDGEL HIS
SHOULDERS HEAVED IN THE EFFORT TO DRAW THE AIR INTO HIS LUNGS HE HAD
A COLORED SCARF ROUND HIS CHIN AND I COULD SEE LITTLE OF HIS FACE
SAVE A PAIR OF KEEN DARK EYES OVERHUNG BY BUSHY WHITE BROWS AND
LONG GRAY SIDEWHISKERS ALTOGETHER HE GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION OF A
RESPECTABLE MASTER MARINER WHO HAD FALLEN INTO YEARS AND POVERTY
WHAT IS IT MY MAN I ASKED
HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM IN THE SLOW METHODICAL FASHION OF OLD AGE
IS MR SHERLOCK HOLMES HERE SAID HE
NO BUT I AM ACTING FOR HIM YOU CAN TELL ME ANY MESSAGE YOU HAVE
FOR HIM
IT WAS TO HIM HIMSELF I WAS TO TELL IT SAID HE
BUT I TELL YOU THAT I AM ACTING FOR HIM WAS IT ABOUT MORDECAI
SMITHS BOAT
YES I KNOWS WELL WHERE IT IS AN I KNOWS WHERE THE MEN HE IS AFTER
ARE AN I KNOWS WHERE THE TREASURE IS I KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT
THEN TELL ME AND I SHALL LET HIM KNOW
IT WAS TO HIM I WAS TO TELL IT HE REPEATED WITH THE PETULANT
OBSTINACY OF A VERY OLD MAN
WELL YOU MUST WAIT FOR HIM
NO NO I AINT GOIN TO LOSE A WHOLE DAY TO PLEASE NO ONE IF MR
HOLMES AINT HERE THEN MR HOLMES MUST FIND IT ALL OUT FOR HIMSELF
I DONT CARE ABOUT THE LOOK OF EITHER OF YOU AND I WONT TELL A
WORD
HE SHUFFLED TOWARDS THE DOOR BUT ATHELNEY JONES GOT IN FRONT OF HIM
WAIT A BIT MY FRIEND SAID HE YOU HAVE IMPORTANT INFORMATION
AND YOU MUST NOT WALK OFF WE SHALL KEEP YOU WHETHER YOU LIKE OR
NOT UNTIL OUR FRIEND RETURNS
THE OLD MAN MADE A LITTLE RUN TOWARDS THE DOOR BUT AS ATHELNEY
JONES PUT HIS BROAD BACK UP AGAINST IT HE RECOGNIZED THE USELESSNESS
OF RESISTANCE
PRETTY SORT O TREATMENT THIS HE CRIED STAMPING HIS STICK I
COME HERE TO SEE A GENTLEMAN AND YOU TWO WHO I NEVER SAW IN MY
LIFE SEIZE ME AND TREAT ME IN THIS FASHION
YOU WILL BE NONE THE WORSE I SAID WE SHALL RECOMPENSE YOU FOR
THE LOSS OF YOUR TIME SIT OVER HERE ON THE SOFA AND YOU WILL NOT
HAVE LONG TO WAIT
HE CAME ACROSS SULLENLY ENOUGH AND SEATED HIMSELF WITH HIS FACE
RESTING ON HIS HANDS JONES AND I RESUMED OUR CIGARS AND OUR TALK
SUDDENLY HOWEVER HOLMESS VOICE BROKE IN UPON US
I THINK THAT YOU MIGHT OFFER ME A CIGAR TOO HE SAID
WE BOTH STARTED IN OUR CHAIRS THERE WAS HOLMES SITTING CLOSE TO US
WITH AN AIR OF QUIET AMUSEMENT
HOLMES I EXCLAIMED YOU HERE BUT WHERE IS THE OLD MAN
HERE IS THE OLD MAN SAID HE HOLDING OUT A HEAP OF WHITE HAIR
HERE HE ISWIG WHISKERS EYEBROWS AND ALL I THOUGHT MY DISGUISE
WAS PRETTY GOOD BUT I HARDLY EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD STAND THAT
TEST
AH YOU ROGUE CRIED JONES HIGHLY DELIGHTED YOU WOULD HAVE MADE
AN ACTOR AND A RARE ONE YOU HAD THE PROPER WORKHOUSE COUGH AND
THOSE WEAK LEGS OF YOURS ARE WORTH TEN POUND A WEEK I THOUGHT I KNEW
THE GLINT OF YOUR EYE THOUGH YOU DIDNT GET AWAY FROM US SO EASILY
YOU SEE
I HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THAT GETUP ALL DAY SAID HE LIGHTING HIS
CIGAR YOU SEE A GOOD MANY OF THE CRIMINAL CLASSES BEGIN TO KNOW
MEESPECIALLY SINCE OUR FRIEND HERE TOOK TO PUBLISHING SOME OF MY
CASES SO I CAN ONLY GO ON THE WARPATH UNDER SOME SIMPLE DISGUISE
LIKE THIS YOU GOT MY WIRE
YES THAT WAS WHAT BROUGHT ME HERE
HOW HAS YOUR CASE PROSPERED
IT HAS ALL COME TO NOTHING I HAVE HAD TO RELEASE TWO OF MY
PRISONERS AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AGAINST THE OTHER TWO
NEVER MIND WE SHALL GIVE YOU TWO OTHERS IN THE PLACE OF THEM BUT
YOU MUST PUT YOURSELF UNDER MY ORDERS YOU ARE WELCOME TO ALL THE
OFFICIAL CREDIT BUT YOU MUST ACT ON THE LINE THAT I POINT OUT IS
THAT AGREED
ENTIRELY IF YOU WILL HELP ME TO THE MEN
WELL THEN IN THE FIRST PLACE I SHALL WANT A FAST POLICEBOATA
STEAM LAUNCHTO BE AT THE WESTMINSTER STAIRS AT SEVEN OCLOCK
THAT IS EASILY MANAGED THERE IS ALWAYS ONE ABOUT THERE BUT I CAN
STEP ACROSS THE ROAD AND TELEPHONE TO MAKE SURE
THEN I SHALL WANT TWO STANCH MEN IN CASE OF RESISTANCE
THERE WILL BE TWO OR THREE IN THE BOAT WHAT ELSE
WHEN WE SECURE THE MEN WE SHALL GET THE TREASURE I THINK THAT IT
WOULD BE A PLEASURE TO MY FRIEND HERE TO TAKE THE BOX ROUND TO THE
YOUNG LADY TO WHOM HALF OF IT RIGHTFULLY BELONGS LET HER BE THE
FIRST TO OPEN ITEH WATSON
IT WOULD BE A GREAT PLEASURE TO ME
RATHER AN IRREGULAR PROCEEDING SAID JONES SHAKING HIS HEAD
HOWEVER THE WHOLE THING IS IRREGULAR AND I SUPPOSE WE MUST WINK AT
IT THE TREASURE MUST AFTERWARDS BE HANDED OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES
UNTIL AFTER THE OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION
CERTAINLY THAT IS EASILY MANAGED ONE OTHER POINT I SHOULD MUCH
LIKE TO HAVE A FEW DETAILS ABOUT THIS MATTER FROM THE LIPS OF
JONATHAN SMALL HIMSELF YOU KNOW I LIKE TO WORK THE DETAIL OF MY
CASES OUT THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO MY HAVING AN UNOFFICIAL INTERVIEW
WITH HIM EITHER HERE IN MY ROOMS OR ELSEWHERE AS LONG AS HE IS
EFFICIENTLY GUARDED
WELL YOU ARE MASTER OF THE SITUATION I HAVE HAD NO PROOF YET OF
THE EXISTENCE OF THIS JONATHAN SMALL HOWEVER IF YOU CAN CATCH HIM I
DONT SEE HOW I CAN REFUSE YOU AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM
THAT IS UNDERSTOOD THEN
PERFECTLY IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
ONLY THAT I INSIST UPON YOUR DINING WITH US IT WILL BE READY IN
HALF AN HOUR I HAVE OYSTERS AND A BRACE OF GROUSE WITH SOMETHING A
LITTLE CHOICE IN WHITE WINESWATSON YOU HAVE NEVER YET RECOGNIZED
MY MERITS AS A HOUSEKEEPER
CHAPTER X
THE END OF THE ISLANDER
OUR MEAL WAS A MERRY ONE HOLMES COUD TALK EXCEEDINGLY WELL WHEN HE
CHOSE AND THAT NIGHT HE DID CHOOSE HE APPEARED TO BE IN A STATE OF
NERVOUS EXALTATION I HAVE NEVER KNOWN HIM SO BRILLIANT HE SPOKE ON
A QUICK SUCCESSION OF SUBJECTSON MIRACLEPLAYS ON MEDIEVAL
POTTERY ON STRADIVARIUS VIOLINS ON THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON AND ON
THE WARSHIPS OF THE FUTUREHANDLING EACH AS THOUGH HE HAD MADE A
SPECIAL STUDY OF IT HIS BRIGHT HUMOR MARKED THE REACTION FROM HIS
BLACK DEPRESSION OF THE PRECEDING DAYS ATHELNEY JONES PROVED TO BE A
SOCIABLE SOUL IN HIS HOURS OF RELAXATION AND FACE HIS DINNER WITH
THE AIR OF A BON VIVANT FOR MYSELF I FELT ELATED AT THE THOUGHT
THAT WE WERE NEARING THE END OF OUR TASK AND I CAUGHT SOMETHING OF
HOLMESS GAIETY NONE OF US ALLUDED DURING DINNER TO THE CAUSE WHICH
HAD BROUGHT US TOGETHER
WHEN THE CLOTH WAS CLEARED HOLMES GLANCED AT THIS WATCH AND FILLED
UP THREE GLASSES WITH PORT ONE BUMPER SAID HE TO THE SUCCESS OF
OUR LITTLE EXPEDITION AND NOW IT IS HIGH TIME WE WERE OFF HAVE YOU
A PISTOL WATSON
I HAVE MY OLD SERVICEREVOLVER IN MY DESK
YOU HAD BEST TAKE IT THEN IT IS WELL TO BE PREPARED I SEE THAT
THE CAB IS AT THE DOOR I ORDERED IT FOR HALFPAST SIX
IT WAS A LITTLE PAST SEVEN BEFORE WE REACHED THE WESTMINSTER WHARF
AND FOUND OUR LAUNCH AWAITING US HOLMES EYED IT CRITICALLY
IS THERE ANYTHING TO MARK IT AS A POLICEBOAT
YESTHAT GREEN LAMP AT THE SIDE
THEN TAKE IT OFF
THE SMALL CHANGE WAS MADE WE STEPPED ON BOARD AND THE ROPES WERE
CAST OFF JONES HOLMES AND I SAT IN THE STERN THERE WAS ONE MAN AT
THE RUDDER ONE TO TEND THE ENGINES AND TWO BURLY POLICEINSPECTORS
FORWARD
WHERE TO ASKED JONES
TO THE TOWER TELL THEM TO STOP OPPOSITE JACOBSONS YARD
OUR CRAFT WAS EVIDENTLY A VERY FAST ONE WE SHOT PAST THE LONG LINES
OF LOADED BARGES AS THOUGH THEY WERE STATIONARY HOLMES SMILED WITH
SATISFACTION AS WE OVERHAULED A RIVER STEAMER AND LEFT HER BEHIND US
WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO CATCH ANYTHING ON THE RIVER HE SAID
WELL HARDLY THAT BUT THERE ARE NOT MANY LAUNCHES TO BEAT US
WE SHALL HAVE TO CATCH THE AURORA AND SHE HAS A NAME FOR BEING A
CLIPPER I WILL TELL YOU HOW THE LAND LIES WATSON YOU RECOLLECT HOW
ANNOYED I WAS AT BEING BALKED BY SO SMALL A THING
YES
WELL I GAVE MY MIND A THOROUGH REST BY PLUNGING INTO A CHEMICAL
ANALYSIS ONE OF OUR GREATEST STATESMEN HAS SAID THAT A CHANGE OF
WORK IS THE BEST REST SO IT IS WHEN I HAD SUCCEEDED IN DISSOLVING
THE HYDROCARBON WHICH I WAS AT WORK AT I CAME BACK TO OUR PROBLEM OF
THE SHOLTOS AND THOUGHT THE WHOLE MATTER OUT AGAIN MY BOYS HAD BEEN
UP THE RIVER AND DOWN THE RIVER WITHOUT RESULT THE LAUNCH WAS NOT AT
ANY LANDINGSTAGE OR WHARF NOR HAD IT RETURNED YET IT COULD HARDLY
HAVE BEEN SCUTTLED TO HIDE THEIR TRACESTHOUGH THAT ALWAYS REMAINED
AS A POSSIBLE HYPOTHESIS IF ALL ELSE FAILED I KNEW THIS MAN SMALL
HAD A CERTAIN DEGREE OF LOW CUNNING BUT I DID NOT THINK HIM CAPABLE
OF ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF DELICATE FINESSE THAT IS USUALLY A
PRODUCT OF HIGHER EDUCATION I THEN REFLECTED THAT SINCE HE HAD
CERTAINLY BEEN IN LONDON SOME TIMEAS WE HAD EVIDENCE THAT HE
MAINTAINED A CONTINUAL WATCH OVER PONDICHERRY LODGEHE COULD HARDLY
LEAVE AT A MOMENTS NOTICE BUT WOULD NEED SOME LITTLE TIME IF IT
WERE ONLY A DAY TO ARRANGE HIS AFFAIRS THAT WAS THE BALANCE OF
PROBABILITY AT ANY RATE
IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A LITTLE WEAK SAID I IT IS MORE PROBABLE
THAT HE HAD ARRANGED HIS AFFAIRS BEFORE EVER HE SET OUT UPON HIS
EXPEDITION
NO I HARDLY THINK SO THIS LAIR OF HIS WOULD BE TOO VALUABLE A
RETREAT IN CASE OF NEED FOR HIM TO GIVE IT UP UNTIL HE WAS SURE THAT
HE COULD DO WITHOUT IT BUT A SECOND CONSIDERATION STRUCK ME
JONATHAN SMALL MUST HAVE FELT THAT THE PECULIAR APPEARANCE OF HIS
COMPANION HOWEVER MUCH HE MAY HAVE TOPCOATED HIM WOULD GIVE RISE
TO GOSSIP AND POSSIBLY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS NORWOOD TRAGEDY HE
WAS QUITE SHARP ENOUGH TO SEE THAT THEY HAD STARTED FROM THEIR
HEADQUARTERS UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS AND HE WOULD WISH TO GET BACK
BEFORE IT WAS BROAD LIGHT NOW IT WAS PAST THREE OCLOCK ACCORDING
TO MRS SMITH WHEN THEY GOT THE BOAT IT WOULD BE QUITE BRIGHT AND
PEOPLE WOULD BE ABOUT IN AN HOUR OR SO THEREFORE I ARGUED THEY DID
NOT GO VERY FAR THEY PAID SMITH WELL TO HOLD HIS TONGUE RESERVED
HIS LAUNCH FOR THE FINAL ESCAPE AND HURRIED TO THEIR LODGINGS WITH
THE TREASUREBOX IN A COUPLE OF NIGHTS WHEN THEY HAD TIME TO SEE
WHAT VIEW THE PAPERS TOOK AND WHETHER THERE WAS ANY SUSPICION THEY
WOULD MAKE THEIR WAY UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS TO SOME SHIP AT
GRAVESEND OR IN THE DOWNS WHERE NO DOUBT THEY HAD ALREADY ARRANGED
FOR PASSAGES TO AMERICA OR THE COLONIES
BUT THE LAUNCH THEY COULD NOT HAVE TAKEN THAT TO THEIR LODGINGS
QUITE SO I ARGUED THAT THE LAUNCH MUST BE NO GREAT WAY OFF IN
SPITE OF ITS INVISIBILITY I THEN PUT MYSELF IN THE PLACE OF SMALL
AND LOOKED AT IT AS A MAN OF HIS CAPACITY WOULD HE WOULD PROBABLY
CONSIDER THAT TO SEND BACK THE LAUNCH OR TO KEEP IT AT A WHARF WOULD
MAKE PURSUIT EASY IF THE POLICE DID HAPPEN TO GET ON HIS TRACK HOW
THEN COULD HE CONCEAL THE LAUNCH AND YET HAVE HER AT HAND WHEN
WANTED I WONDERED WHAT I SHOULD DO MYSELF IF I WERE IN HIS SHOES I
COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY OF DOING IT I MIGHT LAND THE LAUNCH OVER
TO SOME BOATBUILDER OR REPAIRER WITH DIRECTIONS TO MAKE A TRIFLING
CHANGE IN HER SHE WOULD THEN BE REMOVED TO HIS SHED OR HARD AND SO
BE EFFECTUALLY CONCEALED WHILE AT THE SAME TIME I COULD HAVE HER AT
A FEW HOURS NOTICE
THAT SEEMS SIMPLE ENOUGH
IT IS JUST THESE VERY SIMPLE THINGS WHICH ARE EXTREMELY LIABLE TO BE
OVERLOOKED HOWEVER I DETERMINED TO ACT ON THE IDEA I STARTED AT
ONCE IN THIS HARMLESS SEAMANS RIG AND INQUIRED AT ALL THE YARDS DOWN
THE RIVER I DREW BLANK AT FIFTEEN BUT AT THE
SIXTEENTHJACOBSONSI LEARNED THAT THE AURORA HAD BEEN HANDED OVER
TO THEM TWO DAYS AGO BY A WOODENLEGGED MAN WITH SOME TRIVIAL
DIRECTIONS AS TO HER RUDDER THERE AINT NAUGHT AMISS WITH HER
RUDDER SAID THE FOREMAN THERE SHE LIES WITH THE RED STREAKS AT
THAT MOMENT WHO SHOULD COME DOWN BUT MORDECAI SMITH THE MISSING
OWNER HE WAS RATHER THE WORSE FOR LIQUOR I SHOULD NOT OF COURSE
HAVE KNOWN HIM BUT HE BELLOWED OUT HIS NAME AND THE NAME OF HIS
LAUNCH I WANT HER TONIGHT AT EIGHT OCLOCK SAID HEEIGHT
OCLOCK SHARP MIND FOR I HAVE TWO GENTLEMEN WHO WONT BE KEPT
WAITING THEY HAD EVIDENTLY PAID HIM WELL FOR HE WAS VERY FLUSH OF
MONEY CHUCKING SHILLINGS ABOUT TO THE MEN I FOLLOWED HIM SOME
DISTANCE BUT HE SUBSIDED INTO AN ALEHOUSE SO I WENT BACK TO THE
YARD AND HAPPENING TO PICK UP ONE OF MY BOYS ON THE WAY I
STATIONED HIM AS A SENTRY OVER THE LAUNCH HE IS TO STAND AT WATERS
EDGE AND WAVE HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO US WHEN THEY START WE SHALL BE
LYING OFF IN THE STREAM AND IT WILL BE A STRANGE THING IF WE DO NOT
TAKE MEN TREASURE AND ALL
YOU HAVE PLANNED IT ALL VERY NEATLY WHETHER THEY ARE THE RIGHT MEN
OR NOT SAID JONES BUT IF THE AFFAIR WERE IN MY HANDS I SHOULD
HAVE HAD A BODY OF POLICE IN JACOBSONS YARD AND ARRESTED THEM WHEN
THEY CAME DOWN
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN NEVER THIS MAN SMALL IS A PRETTY SHREWD
FELLOW HE WOULD SEND A SCOUT ON AHEAD AND IF ANYTHING MADE HIM
SUSPICIOUS LIE SNUG FOR ANOTHER WEEK
BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE STUCK TO MORDECAI SMITH AND SO BEEN LED TO THEIR
HIDINGPLACE SAID I
IN THAT CASE I SHOULD HAVE WASTED MY DAY I THINK THAT IT IS A
HUNDRED TO ONE AGAINST SMITH KNOWING WHERE THEY LIVE AS LONG AS HE
HAS LIQUOR AND GOOD PAY WHY SHOULD HE ASK QUESTIONS THEY SEND HIM
MESSAGES WHAT TO DO NO I THOUGHT OVER EVERY POSSIBLE COURSE AND
THIS IS THE BEST
WHILE THIS CONVERSATION HAD BEEN PROCEEDING WE HAD BEEN SHOOTING THE
LONG SERIES OF BRIDGES WHICH SPAN THE THAMES AS WE PASSED THE CITY
THE LAST RAYS OF THE SUN WERE GILDING THE CROSS UPON THE SUMMIT OF
ST PAULS IT WAS TWILIGHT BEFORE WE REACHED THE TOWER
THAT IS JACOBSONS YARD SAID HOLMES POINTING TO A BRISTLE OF
MASTS AND RIGGING ON THE SURREY SIDE CRUISE GENTLY UP AND DOWN HERE
UNDER COVER OF THIS STRING OF LIGHTERS HE TOOK A PAIR OF
NIGHTGLASSES FROM HIS POCKET AND GAZED SOME TIME AT THE SHORE I
SEE MY SENTRY AT HIS POST HE REMARKED BUT NO SIGN OF A
HANDKERCHIEF
SUPPOSE WE GO DOWNSTREAM A SHORT WAY AND LIE IN WAIT FOR THEM
SAID JONES EAGERLY WE WERE ALL EAGER BY THIS TIME EVEN THE
POLICEMEN AND STOKERS WHO HAD A VERY VAGUE IDEA OF WHAT WAS GOING
FORWARD
WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED HOLMES ANSWERED IT
IS CERTAINLY TEN TO ONE THAT THEY GO DOWNSTREAM BUT WE CANNOT BE
CERTAIN FROM THIS POINT WE CAN SEE THE ENTRANCE OF THE YARD AND
THEY CAN HARDLY SEE US IT WILL BE A CLEAR NIGHT AND PLENTY OF LIGHT
WE MUST STAY WHERE WE ARE SEE HOW THE FOLK SWARM OVER YONDER IN THE
GASLIGHT
THEY ARE COMING FROM WORK IN THE YARD
DIRTYLOOKING RASCALS BUT I SUPPOSE EVERY ONE HAS SOME LITTLE
IMMORTAL SPARK CONCEALED ABOUT HIM YOU WOULD NOT THINK IT TO LOOK
AT THEM THERE IS NO A PRIORI PROBABILITY ABOUT IT A STRANGE ENIGMA
IS MAN
SOME ONE CALLS HIM A SOUL CONCEALED IN AN ANIMAL I SUGGESTED
WINWOOD READE IS GOOD UPON THE SUBJECT SAID HOLMES HE REMARKS
THAT WHILE THE INDIVIDUAL MAN IS AN INSOLUBLE PUZZLE IN THE
AGGREGATE HE BECOMES A MATHEMATICAL CERTAINTY YOU CAN FOR EXAMPLE
NEVER FORETELL WHAT ANY ONE MAN WILL DO BUT YOU CAN SAY WITH
PRECISION WHAT AN AVERAGE NUMBER WILL BE UP TO INDIVIDUALS VARY BUT
PERCENTAGES REMAIN CONSTANT SO SAYS THE STATISTICIAN BUT DO I SEE A
HANDKERCHIEF SURELY THERE IS A WHITE FLUTTER OVER YONDER
YES IT IS YOUR BOY I CRIED I CAN SEE HIM PLAINLY
AND THERE IS THE AURORA EXCLAIMED HOLMES AND GOING LIKE THE
DEVIL FULL SPEED AHEAD ENGINEER MAKE AFTER THAT LAUNCH WITH THE
YELLOW LIGHT BY HEAVEN I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF IF SHE PROVES
TO HAVE THE HEELS OF US
SHE HAD SLIPPED UNSEEN THROUGH THE YARDENTRANCE AND PASSED BEHIND
TWO OR THREE SMALL CRAFT SO THAT SHE HAD FAIRLY GOT HER SPEED UP
BEFORE WE SAW HER NOW SHE WAS FLYING DOWN THE STREAM NEAR IN TO THE
SHORE GOING AT A TREMENDOUS RATE JONES LOOKED GRAVELY AT HER AND
SHOOK HIS HEAD
SHE IS VERY FAST HE SAID I DOUBT IF WE SHALL CATCH HER
WE MUST CATCH HER CRIED HOLMES BETWEEN HIS TEETH HEAP IT ON
STOKERS MAKE HER DO ALL SHE CAN IF WE BURN THE BOAT WE MUST HAVE
THEM
WE WERE FAIRLY AFTER HER NOW THE FURNACES ROARED AND THE POWERFUL
ENGINES WHIZZED AND CLANKED LIKE A GREAT METALLIC HEART HER SHARP
STEEP PROW CUT THROUGH THE RIVERWATER AND SENT TWO ROLLING WAVES TO
RIGHT AND TO LEFT OF US WITH EVERY THROB OF THE ENGINES WE SPRANG
AND QUIVERED LIKE A LIVING THING ONE GREAT YELLOW LANTERN IN OUR
BOWS THREW A LONG FLICKERING FUNNEL OF LIGHT IN FRONT OF US RIGHT
AHEAD A DARK BLUR UPON THE WATER SHOWED WHERE THE AURORA LAY AND THE
SWIRL OF WHITE FOAM BEHIND HER SPOKE OF THE PACE AT WHICH SHE WAS
GOING WE FLASHED PAST BARGES STEAMERS MERCHANTVESSELS IN AND
OUT BEHIND THIS ONE AND ROUND THE OTHER VOICES HAILED US OUT OF THE
DARKNESS BUT STILL THE AURORA THUNDERED ON AND STILL WE FOLLOWED
CLOSE UPON HER TRACK
PILE IT ON MEN PILE IT ON CRIED HOLMES LOOKING DOWN INTO THE
ENGINEROOM WHILE THE FIERCE GLOW FROM BELOW BEAT UPON HIS EAGER
AQUILINE FACE GET EVERY POUND OF STEAM YOU CAN
I THINK WE GAIN A LITTLE SAID JONES WITH HIS EYES ON THE AURORA
I AM SURE OF IT SAID I WE SHALL BE UP WITH HER IN A VERY FEW
MINUTES
AT THAT MOMENT HOWEVER AS OUR EVIL FATE WOULD HAVE IT A TUG WITH
THREE BARGES IN TOW BLUNDERED IN BETWEEN US IT WAS ONLY BY PUTTING
OUR HELM HARD DOWN THAT WE AVOIDED A COLLISION AND BEFORE WE COULD
ROUND THEM AND RECOVER OUR WAY THE AURORA HAD GAINED A GOOD TWO
HUNDRED YARDS SHE WAS STILL HOWEVER WELL IN VIEW AND THE MURKY
UNCERTAIN TWILIGHT WAS SETTING INTO A CLEAR STARLIT NIGHT OUR
BOILERS WERE STRAINED TO THEIR UTMOST AND THE FRAIL SHELL VIBRATED
AND CREAKED WITH THE FIERCE ENERGY WHICH WAS DRIVING US ALONG WE HAD
SHOT THROUGH THE POOL PAST THE WEST INDIA DOCKS DOWN THE LONG
DEPTFORD REACH AND UP AGAIN AFTER ROUNDING THE ISLE OF DOGS THE
DULL BLUR IN FRONT OF US RESOLVED ITSELF NOW CLEARLY ENOUGH INTO THE
DAINTY AURORA JONES TURNED OUR SEARCHLIGHT UPON HER SO THAT WE
COULD PLAINLY SEE THE FIGURES UPON HER DECK ONE MAN SAT BY THE
STERN WITH SOMETHING BLACK BETWEEN HIS KNEES OVER WHICH HE STOOPED
BESIDE HIM LAY A DARK MASS WHICH LOOKED LIKE A NEWFOUNDLAND DOG THE
BOY HELD THE TILLER WHILE AGAINST THE RED GLARE OF THE FURNACE I
COULD SEE OLD SMITH STRIPPED TO THE WAIST AND SHOVELLING COALS FOR
DEAR LIFE THEY MAY HAVE HAD SOME DOUBT AT FIRST AS TO WHETHER WE
WERE REALLY PURSUING THEM BUT NOW AS WE FOLLOWED EVERY WINDING AND
TURNING WHICH THEY TOOK THERE COULD NO LONGER BE ANY QUESTION ABOUT
IT AT GREENWICH WE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PACES BEHIND THEM AT
BLACKWALL WE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY I
HAVE COURSED MANY CREATURES IN MANY COUNTRIES DURING MY CHECKERED
CAREER BUT NEVER DID SPORT GIVE ME SUCH A WILD THRILL AS THIS MAD
FLYING MANHUNT DOWN THE THAMES STEADILY WE DREW IN UPON THEM YARD
BY YARD IN THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT WE COULD HEAR THE PANTING AND
CLANKING OF THEIR MACHINERY THE MAN IN THE STERN STILL CROUCHED UPON
THE DECK AND HIS ARMS WERE MOVING AS THOUGH HE WERE BUSY WHILE
EVERY NOW AND THEN HE WOULD LOOK UP AND MEASURE WITH A GLANCE THE
DISTANCE WHICH STILL SEPARATED US NEARER WE CAME AND NEARER JONES
YELLED TO THEM TO STOP WE WERE NOT MORE THAN FOUR BOATS LENGTHS
BEHIND THEM BOTH BOATS FLYING AT A TREMENDOUS PACE IT WAS A CLEAR
REACH OF THE RIVER WITH BARKING LEVEL UPON ONE SIDE AND THE
MELANCHOLY PLUMSTEAD MARSHES UPON THE OTHER AT OUR HAIL THE MAN IN
THE STERN SPRANG UP FROM THE DECK AND SHOOK HIS TWO CLINCHED FISTS AT
US CURSING THE WHILE IN A HIGH CRACKED VOICE HE WAS A GOODSIZED
POWERFUL MAN AND AS HE STOOD POISING HIMSELF WITH LEGS ASTRIDE I
COULD SEE THAT FROM THE THIGH DOWNWARDS THERE WAS BUT A WOODEN STUMP
UPON THE RIGHT SIDE AT THE SOUND OF HIS STRIDENT ANGRY CRIES THERE
WAS MOVEMENT IN THE HUDDLED BUNDLE UPON THE DECK IT STRAIGHTENED
ITSELF INTO A LITTLE BLACK MANTHE SMALLEST I HAVE EVER SEENWITH A
GREAT MISSHAPEN HEAD AND A SHOCK OF TANGLED DISHEVELLED HAIR
HOLMES HAD ALREADY DRAWN HIS REVOLVER AND I WHIPPED OUT MINE AT THE
SIGHT OF THIS SAVAGE DISTORTED CREATURE HE WAS WRAPPED IN SOME SORT
OF DARK ULSTER OR BLANKET WHICH LEFT ONLY HIS FACE EXPOSED BUT THAT
FACE WAS ENOUGH TO GIVE A MAN A SLEEPLESS NIGHT NEVER HAVE I SEEN
FEATURES SO DEEPLY MARKED WITH ALL BESTIALITY AND CRUELTY HIS SMALL
EYES GLOWED AND BURNED WITH A SOMBRE LIGHT AND HIS THICK LIPS WERE
WRITHED BACK FROM HIS TEETH WHICH GRINNED AND CHATTERED AT US WITH A
HALF ANIMAL FURY
FIRE IF HE RAISES HIS HAND SAID HOLMES QUIETLY WE WERE WITHIN A
BOATSLENGTH BY THIS TIME AND ALMOST WITHIN TOUCH OF OUR QUARRY I
CAN SEE THE TWO OF THEM NOW AS THEY STOOD THE WHITE MAN WITH HIS
LEGS FAR APART SHRIEKING OUT CURSES AND THE UNHALLOWED DWARF WITH
HIS HIDEOUS FACE AND HIS STRONG YELLOW TEETH GNASHING AT US IN THE
LIGHT OF OUR LANTERN
IT WAS WELL THAT WE HAD SO CLEAR A VIEW OF HIM EVEN AS WE LOOKED HE
PLUCKED OUT FROM UNDER HIS COVERING A SHORT ROUND PIECE OF WOOD
LIKE A SCHOOLRULER AND CLAPPED IT TO HIS LIPS OUR PISTOLS RANG OUT
TOGETHER HE WHIRLED ROUND THREW UP HIS ARMS AND WITH A KIND OF
CHOKING COUGH FELL SIDEWAYS INTO THE STREAM I CAUGHT ONE GLIMPSE OF
HIS VENOMOUS MENACING EYES AMID THE WHITE SWIRL OF THE WATERS AT
THE SAME MOMENT THE WOODENLEGGED MAN THREW HIMSELF UPON THE RUDDER
AND PUT IT HARD DOWN SO THAT HIS BOAT MADE STRAIGHT IN FOR THE
SOUTHERN BANK WHILE WE SHOT PAST HER STERN ONLY CLEARING HER BY A
FEW FEET WE WERE ROUND AFTER HER IN AN INSTANT BUT SHE WAS ALREADY
NEARLY AT THE BANK IT WAS A WILD AND DESOLATE PLACE WHERE THE MOON
GLIMMERED UPON A WIDE EXPANSE OF MARSHLAND WITH POOLS OF STAGNANT
WATER AND BEDS OF DECAYING VEGETATION THE LAUNCH WITH A DULL THUD
RAN UP UPON THE MUDBANK WITH HER BOW IN THE AIR AND HER STERN FLUSH
WITH THE WATER THE FUGITIVE SPRANG OUT BUT HIS STUMP INSTANTLY SANK
ITS WHOLE LENGTH INTO THE SODDEN SOIL IN VAIN HE STRUGGLED AND
WRITHED NOT ONE STEP COULD HE POSSIBLY TAKE EITHER FORWARDS OR
BACKWARDS HE YELLED IN IMPOTENT RAGE AND KICKED FRANTICALLY INTO
THE MUD WITH HIS OTHER FOOT BUT HIS STRUGGLES ONLY BORED HIS WOODEN
PIN THE DEEPER INTO THE STICKY BANK WHEN WE BROUGHT OUR LAUNCH
ALONGSIDE HE WAS SO FIRMLY ANCHORED THAT IT WAS ONLY BY THROWING THE
END OF A ROPE OVER HIS SHOULDERS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HAUL HIM OUT
AND TO DRAG HIM LIKE SOME EVIL FISH OVER OUR SIDE THE TWO SMITHS
FATHER AND SON SAT SULLENLY IN THEIR LAUNCH BUT CAME ABOARD MEEKLY
ENOUGH WHEN COMMANDED THE AURORA HERSELF WE HAULED OFF AND MADE FAST
TO OUR STERN A SOLID IRON CHEST OF INDIAN WORKMANSHIP STOOD UPON THE
DECK THIS THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION WAS THE SAME THAT HAD
CONTAINED THE ILLOMENED TREASURE OF THE SHOLTOS THERE WAS NO KEY
BUT IT WAS OF CONSIDERABLE WEIGHT SO WE TRANSFERRED IT CAREFULLY TO
OUR OWN LITTLE CABIN AS WE STEAMED SLOWLY UPSTREAM AGAIN WE
FLASHED OUR SEARCHLIGHT IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF
THE ISLANDER SOMEWHERE IN THE DARK OOZE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THAMES
LIE THE BONES OF THAT STRANGE VISITOR TO OUR SHORES
SEE HERE SAID HOLMES POINTING TO THE WOODEN HATCHWAY WE WERE
HARDLY QUICK ENOUGH WITH OUR PISTOLS THERE SURE ENOUGH JUST
BEHIND WHERE WE HAD BEEN STANDING STUCK ONE OF THOSE MURDEROUS DARTS
WHICH WE KNEW SO WELL IT MUST HAVE WHIZZED BETWEEN US AT THE INSTANT
THAT WE FIRED HOLMES SMILED AT IT AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN HIS
EASY FASHION BUT I CONFESS THAT IT TURNED ME SICK TO THINK OF THE
HORRIBLE DEATH WHICH HAD PASSED SO CLOSE TO US THAT NIGHT
CHAPTER XI
THE GREAT AGRA TREASURE
OUR CAPTIVE SAT IN THE CABIN OPPOSITE TO THE IRON BOX WHICH HE HAD
DONE SO MUCH AND WAITED SO LONG TO GAIN HE WAS A SUNBURNED
RECKLESSEYED FELLOW WITH A NETWORK OF LINES AND WRINKLES ALL OVER
HIS MAHOGANY FEATURES WHICH TOLD OF A HARD OPENAIR LIFE THERE WAS
A SINGULAR PROMINENCE ABOUT HIS BEARDED CHIN WHICH MARKED A MAN WHO
WAS NOT TO BE EASILY TURNED FROM HIS PURPOSE HIS AGE MAY HAVE BEEN
FIFTY OR THEREABOUTS FOR HIS BLACK CURLY HAIR WAS THICKLY SHOT WITH
GRAY HIS FACE IN REPOSE WAS NOT AN UNPLEASING ONE THOUGH HIS HEAVY
BROWS AND AGGRESSIVE CHIN GAVE HIM AS I HAD LATELY SEEN A TERRIBLE
EXPRESSION WHEN MOVED TO ANGER HE SAT NOW WITH HIS HANDCUFFED HANDS
UPON HIS LAP AND HIS HEAD SUNK UPON HIS BREAST WHILE HE LOOKED WITH
HIS KEEN TWINKLING EYES AT THE BOX WHICH HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF HIS
ILLDOINGS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THERE WAS MORE SORROW THAN ANGER IN
HIS RIGID AND CONTAINED COUNTENANCE ONCE HE LOOKED UP AT ME WITH A
GLEAM OF SOMETHING LIKE HUMOUR IN HIS EYES
WELL JONATHAN SMALL SAID HOLMES LIGHTING A CIGAR I AM SORRY
THAT IT HAS COME TO THIS
AND SO AM I SIR HE ANSWERED FRANKLY I DONT BELIEVE THAT I CAN
SWING OVER THE JOB I GIVE YOU MY WORD ON THE BOOK THAT I NEVER
RAISED HAND AGAINST MR SHOLTO IT WAS THAT LITTLE HELLHOUND TONGA
WHO SHOT ONE OF HIS CURSED DARTS INTO HIM I HAD NO PART IN IT SIR
I WAS AS GRIEVED AS IF IT HAD BEEN MY BLOODRELATION I WELTED THE
LITTLE DEVIL WITH THE SLACK END OF THE ROPE FOR IT BUT IT WAS DONE
AND I COULD NOT UNDO IT AGAIN
HAVE A CIGAR SAID HOLMES AND YOU HAD BEST TAKE A PULL OUT OF MY
FLASK FOR YOU ARE VERY WET HOW COULD YOU EXPECT SO SMALL AND WEAK A
MAN AS THIS BLACK FELLOW TO OVERPOWER MR SHOLTO AND HOLD HIM WHILE
YOU WERE CLIMBING THE ROPE
YOU SEEM TO KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT IT AS IF YOU WERE THERE SIR THE
TRUTH IS THAT I HOPED TO FIND THE ROOM CLEAR I KNEW THE HABITS OF
THE HOUSE PRETTY WELL AND IT WAS THE TIME WHEN MR SHOLTO USUALLY
WENT DOWN TO HIS SUPPER I SHALL MAKE NO SECRET OF THE BUSINESS THE
BEST DEFENCE THAT I CAN MAKE IS JUST THE SIMPLE TRUTH NOW IF IT HAD
BEEN THE OLD MAJOR I WOULD HAVE SWUNG FOR HIM WITH A LIGHT HEART I
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT NO MORE OF KNIFING HIM THAN OF SMOKING THIS CIGAR
BUT ITS CURSED HARD THAT I SHOULD BE LAGGED OVER THIS YOUNG SHOLTO
WITH WHOM I HAD NO QUARREL WHATEVER
YOU ARE UNDER THE CHARGE OF MR ATHELNEY JONES OF SCOTLAND YARD HE
IS GOING TO BRING YOU UP TO MY ROOMS AND I SHALL ASK YOU FOR A TRUE
ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER YOU MUST MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT FOR IF YOU
DO I HOPE THAT I MAY BE OF USE TO YOU I THINK I CAN PROVE THAT THE
POISON ACTS SO QUICKLY THAT THE MAN WAS DEAD BEFORE EVER YOU REACHED
THE ROOM
THAT HE WAS SIR I NEVER GOT SUCH A TURN IN MY LIFE AS WHEN I SAW
HIM GRINNING AT ME WITH HIS HEAD ON HIS SHOULDER AS I CLIMBED THROUGH
THE WINDOW IT FAIRLY SHOOK ME SIR ID HAVE HALF KILLED TONGA FOR
IT IF HE HAD NOT SCRAMBLED OFF THAT WAS HOW HE CAME TO LEAVE HIS
CLUB AND SOME OF HIS DARTS TOO AS HE TELLS ME WHICH I DARE SAY
HELPED TO PUT YOU ON OUR TRACK THOUGH HOW YOU KEPT ON IT IS MORE
THAN I CAN TELL I DONT FEEL NO MALICE AGAINST YOU FOR IT BUT IT
DOES SEEM A QUEER THING HE ADDED WITH A BITTER SMILE THAT I WHO
HAVE A FAIR CLAIM TO NIGH UPON HALF A MILLION OF MONEY SHOULD SPEND
THE FIRST HALF OF MY LIFE BUILDING A BREAKWATER IN THE ANDAMANS AND
AM LIKE TO SPEND THE OTHER HALF DIGGING DRAINS AT DARTMOOR IT WAS AN
EVIL DAY FOR ME WHEN FIRST I CLAPPED EYES UPON THE MERCHANT ACHMET
AND HAD TO DO WITH THE AGRA TREASURE WHICH NEVER BROUGHT ANYTHING
BUT A CURSE YET UPON THE MAN WHO OWNED IT TO HIM IT BROUGHT MURDER
TO MAJOR SHOLTO IT BROUGHT FEAR AND GUILT TO ME IT HAS MEANT SLAVERY
FOR LIFE
AT THIS MOMENT ATHELNEY JONES THRUST HIS BROAD FACE AND HEAVY
SHOULDERS INTO THE TINY CABIN QUITE A FAMILY PARTY HE REMARKED
I THINK I SHALL HAVE A PULL AT THAT FLASK HOLMES WELL I THINK WE
MAY ALL CONGRATULATE EACH OTHER PITY WE DIDNT TAKE THE OTHER ALIVE
BUT THERE WAS NO CHOICE I SAY HOLMES YOU MUST CONFESS THAT YOU CUT
IT RATHER FINE IT WAS ALL WE COULD DO TO OVERHAUL HER
ALL IS WELL THAT ENDS WELL SAID HOLMES BUT I CERTAINLY DID NOT
KNOW THAT THE AURORA WAS SUCH A CLIPPER
SMITH SAYS SHE IS ONE OF THE FASTEST LAUNCHES ON THE RIVER AND THAT
IF HE HAD HAD ANOTHER MAN TO HELP HIM WITH THE ENGINES WE SHOULD
NEVER HAVE CAUGHT HER HE SWEARS HE KNEW NOTHING OF THIS NORWOOD
BUSINESS
NEITHER HE DID CRIED OUR PRISONERNOT A WORD I CHOSE HIS
LAUNCH BECAUSE I HEARD THAT SHE WAS A FLIER WE TOLD HIM NOTHING BUT
WE PAID HIM WELL AND HE WAS TO GET SOMETHING HANDSOME IF WE REACHED
OUR VESSEL THE ESMERALDA AT GRAVESEND OUTWARD BOUND FOR THE
BRAZILS
WELL IF HE HAS DONE NO WRONG WE SHALL SEE THAT NO WRONG COMES TO
HIM IF WE ARE PRETTY QUICK IN CATCHING OUR MEN WE ARE NOT SO QUICK
IN CONDEMNING THEM IT WAS AMUSING TO NOTICE HOW THE CONSEQUENTIAL
JONES WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GIVE HIMSELF AIRS ON THE STRENGTH OF
THE CAPTURE FROM THE SLIGHT SMILE WHICH PLAYED OVER SHERLOCK
HOLMESS FACE I COULD SEE THAT THE SPEECH HAD NOT BEEN LOST UPON
HIM
WE WILL BE AT VAUXHALL BRIDGE PRESENTLY SAID JONES AND SHALL
LAND YOU DR WATSON WITH THE TREASUREBOX I NEED HARDLY TELL YOU
THAT I AM TAKING A VERY GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY UPON MYSELF IN DOING
THIS IT IS MOST IRREGULAR BUT OF COURSE AN AGREEMENT IS AN
AGREEMENT I MUST HOWEVER AS A MATTER OF DUTY SEND AN INSPECTOR
WITH YOU SINCE YOU HAVE SO VALUABLE A CHARGE YOU WILL DRIVE NO
DOUBT
YES I SHALL DRIVE
IT IS A PITY THERE IS NO KEY THAT WE MAY MAKE AN INVENTORY FIRST
YOU WILL HAVE TO BREAK IT OPEN WHERE IS THE KEY MY MAN
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER SAID SMALL SHORTLY
HUM THERE WAS NO USE YOUR GIVING THIS UNNECESSARY TROUBLE WE HAVE
HAD WORK ENOUGH ALREADY THROUGH YOU HOWEVER DOCTOR I NEED NOT WARN
YOU TO BE CAREFUL BRING THE BOX BACK WITH YOU TO THE BAKER STREET
ROOMS YOU WILL FIND US THERE ON OUR WAY TO THE STATION
THEY LANDED ME AT VAUXHALL WITH MY HEAVY IRON BOX AND WITH A BLUFF
GENIAL INSPECTOR AS MY COMPANION A QUARTER OF AN HOURS DRIVE
BROUGHT US TO MRS CECIL FORRESTERS THE SERVANT SEEMED SURPRISED AT
SO LATE A VISITOR MRS CECIL FORRESTER WAS OUT FOR THE EVENING SHE
EXPLAINED AND LIKELY TO BE VERY LATE MISS MORSTAN HOWEVER WAS IN
THE DRAWINGROOM SO TO THE DRAWINGROOM I WENT BOX IN HAND LEAVING
THE OBLIGING INSPECTOR IN THE CAB
SHE WAS SEATED BY THE OPEN WINDOW DRESSED IN SOME SORT OF WHITE
DIAPHANOUS MATERIAL WITH A LITTLE TOUCH OF SCARLET AT THE NECK AND
WAIST THE SOFT LIGHT OF A SHADED LAMP FELL UPON HER AS SHE LEANED
BACK IN THE BASKET CHAIR PLAYING OVER HER SWEET GRAVE FACE AND
TINTING WITH A DULL METALLIC SPARKLE THE RICH COILS OF HER LUXURIANT
HAIR ONE WHITE ARM AND HAND DROOPED OVER THE SIDE OF THE CHAIR AND
HER WHOLE POSE AND FIGURE SPOKE OF AN ABSORBING MELANCHOLY AT THE
SOUND OF MY FOOTFALL SHE SPRANG TO HER FEET HOWEVER AND A BRIGHT
FLUSH OF SURPRISE AND OF PLEASURE COLORED HER PALE CHEEKS
I HEARD A CAB DRIVE UP SHE SAID I THOUGHT THAT MRS FORRESTER
HAD COME BACK VERY EARLY BUT I NEVER DREAMED THAT IT MIGHT BE YOU
WHAT NEWS HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME
I HAVE BROUGHT SOMETHING BETTER THAN NEWS SAID I PUTTING DOWN THE
BOX UPON THE TABLE AND SPEAKING JOVIALLY AND BOISTEROUSLY THOUGH MY
HEART WAS HEAVY WITHIN ME I HAVE BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING WHICH IS
WORTH ALL THE NEWS IN THE WORLD I HAVE BROUGHT YOU A FORTUNE
SHE GLANCED AT IRON BOX IS THAT THE TREASURE THEN SHE ASKED
COOLLY ENOUGH
YES THIS IS THE GREAT AGRA TREASURE HALF OF IT IS YOURS AND HALF
IS THADDEUS SHOLTOS YOU WILL HAVE A COUPLE OF HUNDRED THOUSAND
EACH THINK OF THAT AN ANNUITY OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS THERE WILL BE
FEW RICHER YOUNG LADIES IN ENGLAND IS IT NOT GLORIOUS
I THINK THAT I MUST HAVE BEEN RATHER OVERACTING MY DELIGHT AND THAT
SHE DETECTED A HOLLOW RING IN MY CONGRATULATIONS FOR I SAW HER
EYEBROWS RISE A LITTLE AND SHE GLANCED AT ME CURIOUSLY
IF I HAVE IT SAID SHE I OWE IT TO YOU
NO NO I ANSWERED NOT TO ME BUT TO MY FRIEND SHERLOCK HOLMES
WITH ALL THE WILL IN THE WORLD I COULD NEVER HAVE FOLLOWED UP A CLUE
WHICH HAS TAXED EVEN HIS ANALYTICAL GENIUS AS IT WAS WE VERY
NEARLY LOST IT AT THE LAST MOMENT
PRAY SIT DOWN AND TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT DR WATSON SAID SHE
I NARRATED BRIEFLY WHAT HAD OCCURRED SINCE I HAD SEEN HER
LASTHOLMESS NEW METHOD OF SEARCH THE DISCOVERY OF THE AURORA
THE APPEARANCE OF ATHELNEY JONES OUR EXPEDITION IN THE EVENING AND
THE WILD CHASE DOWN THE THAMES SHE LISTENED WITH PARTED LIPS AND
SHINING EYES TO MY RECITAL OF OUR ADVENTURES WHEN I SPOKE OF THE
DART WHICH HAD SO NARROWLY MISSED US SHE TURNED SO WHITE THAT I
FEARED THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO FAINT
IT IS NOTHING SHE SAID AS I HASTENED TO POUR HER OUT SOME WATER
I AM ALL RIGHT AGAIN IT WAS A SHOCK TO ME TO HEAR THAT I HAD PLACED
MY FRIENDS IN SUCH HORRIBLE PERIL
THAT IS ALL OVER I ANSWERED IT WAS NOTHING I WILL TELL YOU NO
MORE GLOOMY DETAILS LET US TURN TO SOMETHING BRIGHTER THERE IS THE
TREASURE WHAT COULD BE BRIGHTER THAN THAT I GOT LEAVE TO BRING IT
WITH ME THINKING THAT IT WOULD INTEREST YOU TO BE THE FIRST TO SEE
IT
IT WOULD BE OF THE GREATEST INTEREST TO ME SHE SAID THERE WAS NO
EAGERNESS IN HER VOICE HOWEVER IT HAD STRUCK HER DOUBTLESS THAT
IT MIGHT SEEM UNGRACIOUS UPON HER PART TO BE INDIFFERENT TO A PRIZE
WHICH HAD COST SO MUCH TO WIN
WHAT A PRETTY BOX SHE SAID STOOPING OVER IT THIS IS INDIAN
WORK I SUPPOSE
YES IT IS BENARES METALWORK
AND SO HEAVY SHE EXCLAIMED TRYING TO RAISE IT THE BOX ALONE
MUST BE OF SOME VALUE WHERE IS THE KEY
SMALL THREW IT INTO THE THAMES I ANSWERED I MUST BORROW MRS
FORRESTERS POKER THERE WAS IN THE FRONT A THICK AND BROAD HASP
WROUGHT IN THE IMAGE OF A SITTING BUDDHA UNDER THIS I THRUST THE END
OF THE POKER AND TWISTED IT OUTWARD AS A LEVER THE HASP SPRANG OPEN
WITH A LOUD SNAP WITH TREMBLING FINGERS I FLUNG BACK THE LID WE
BOTH STOOD GAZING IN ASTONISHMENT THE BOX WAS EMPTY
NO WONDER THAT IT WAS HEAVY THE IRONWORK WAS TWOTHIRDS OF AN INCH
THICK ALL ROUND IT WAS MASSIVE WELL MADE AND SOLID LIKE A CHEST
CONSTRUCTED TO CARRY THINGS OF GREAT PRICE BUT NOT ONE SHRED OR
CRUMB OF METAL OR JEWELRY LAY WITHIN IT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AND
COMPLETELY EMPTY
THE TREASURE IS LOST SAID MISS MORSTAN CALMLY
AS I LISTENED TO THE WORDS AND REALIZED WHAT THEY MEANT A GREAT
SHADOW SEEMED TO PASS FROM MY SOUL I DID NOT KNOW HOW THIS AGRA
TREASURE HAD WEIGHED ME DOWN UNTIL NOW THAT IT WAS FINALLY REMOVED
IT WAS SELFISH NO DOUBT DISLOYAL WRONG BUT I COULD REALIZE
NOTHING SAVE THAT THE GOLDEN BARRIER WAS GONE FROM BETWEEN US THANK
GOD I EJACULATED FROM MY VERY HEART
SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH A QUICK QUESTIONING SMILE WHY DO YOU SAY
THAT SHE ASKED
BECAUSE YOU ARE WITHIN MY REACH AGAIN I SAID TAKING HER HAND SHE
DID NOT WITHDRAW IT BECAUSE I LOVE YOU MARY AS TRULY AS EVER A
MAN LOVED A WOMAN BECAUSE THIS TREASURE THESE RICHES SEALED MY
LIPS NOW THAT THEY ARE GONE I CAN TELL YOU HOW I LOVE YOU THAT IS
WHY I SAID THANK GOD
THEN I SAY THANK GOD TOO SHE WHISPERED AS I DREW HER TO MY
SIDE WHOEVER HAD LOST A TREASURE I KNEW THAT NIGHT THAT I HAD
GAINED ONE
CHAPTER XII
THE STRANGE STORY OF JONATHAN SMALL
A VERY PATIENT MAN WAS THAT INSPECTOR IN THE CAB FOR IT WAS A WEARY
TIME BEFORE I REJOINED HIM HIS FACE CLOUDED OVER WHEN I SHOWED HIM
THE EMPTY BOX
THERE GOES THE REWARD SAID HE GLOOMILY WHERE THERE IS NO MONEY
THERE IS NO PAY THIS NIGHTS WORK WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH A TENNER
EACH TO SAM BROWN AND ME IF THE TREASURE HAD BEEN THERE
MR THADDEUS SHOLTO IS A RICH MAN I SAID HE WILL SEE THAT YOU
ARE REWARDED TREASURE OR NO
THE INSPECTOR SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDENTLY HOWEVER ITS A BAD JOB
HE REPEATED AND SO MR ATHELNEY JONES WILL THINK
HIS FORECAST PROVED TO BE CORRECT FOR THE DETECTIVE LOOKED BLANK
ENOUGH WHEN I GOT TO BAKER STREET AND SHOWED HIM THE EMPTY BOX THEY
HAD ONLY JUST ARRIVED HOLMES THE PRISONER AND HE FOR THEY HAD
CHANGED THEIR PLANS SO FAR AS TO REPORT THEMSELVES AT A STATION UPON
THE WAY MY COMPANION LOUNGED IN HIS ARMCHAIR WITH HIS USUAL
LISTLESS EXPRESSION WHILE SMALL SAT STOLIDLY OPPOSITE TO HIM WITH
HIS WOODEN LEG COCKED OVER HIS SOUND ONE AS I EXHIBITED THE EMPTY
BOX HE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND LAUGHED ALOUD
THIS IS YOUR DOING SMALL SAID ATHELNEY JONES ANGRILY
YES I HAVE PUT IT AWAY WHERE YOU SHALL NEVER LAY HAND UPON IT HE
CRIED EXULTANTLY IT IS MY TREASURE AND IF I CANT HAVE THE LOOT
ILL TAKE DARNED GOOD CARE THAT NO ONE ELSE DOES I TELL YOU THAT NO
LIVING MAN HAS ANY RIGHT TO IT UNLESS IT IS THREE MEN WHO ARE IN THE
ANDAMAN CONVICTBARRACKS AND MYSELF I KNOW NOW THAT I CANNOT HAVE
THE USE OF IT AND I KNOW THAT THEY CANNOT I HAVE ACTED ALL THROUGH
FOR THEM AS MUCH AS FOR MYSELF ITS BEEN THE SIGN OF FOUR WITH US
ALWAYS WELL I KNOW THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD ME DO JUST WHAT I HAVE
DONE AND THROW THE TREASURE INTO THE THAMES RATHER THAN LET IT GO TO
KITH OR KIN OF SHOLTO OR OF MORSTAN IT WAS NOT TO MAKE THEM RICH
THAT WE DID FOR ACHMET YOULL FIND THE TREASURE WHERE THE KEY IS
AND WHERE LITTLE TONGA IS WHEN I SAW THAT YOUR LAUNCH MUST CATCH US
I PUT THE LOOT AWAY IN A SAFE PLACE THERE ARE NO RUPEES FOR YOU THIS
JOURNEY
YOU ARE DECEIVING US SMALL SAID ATHELNEY JONES STERNLY IF YOU
HAD WISHED TO THROW THE TREASURE INTO THE THAMES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
EASIER FOR YOU TO HAVE THROWN BOX AND ALL
EASIER FOR ME TO THROW AND EASIER FOR YOU TO RECOVER HE ANSWERED
WITH A SHREWD SIDELONG LOOK THE MAN THAT WAS CLEVER ENOUGH TO HUNT
ME DOWN IS CLEVER ENOUGH TO PICK AN IRON BOX FROM THE BOTTOM OF A
RIVER NOW THAT THEY ARE SCATTERED OVER FIVE MILES OR SO IT MAY BE A
HARDER JOB IT WENT TO MY HEART TO DO IT THOUGH I WAS HALF MAD WHEN
YOU CAME UP WITH US HOWEVER THERES NO GOOD GRIEVING OVER IT IVE
HAD UPS IN MY LIFE AND IVE HAD DOWNS BUT IVE LEARNED NOT TO CRY
OVER SPILLED MILK
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER SMALL SAID THE DETECTIVE IF YOU
HAD HELPED JUSTICE INSTEAD OF THWARTING IT IN THIS WAY YOU WOULD
HAVE HAD A BETTER CHANCE AT YOUR TRIAL
JUSTICE SNARLED THE EXCONVICT A PRETTY JUSTICE WHOSE LOOT IS
THIS IF IT IS NOT OURS WHERE IS THE JUSTICE THAT I SHOULD GIVE IT
UP TO THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER EARNED IT LOOK HOW I HAVE EARNED IT
TWENTY LONG YEARS IN THAT FEVERRIDDEN SWAMP ALL DAY AT WORK UNDER
THE MANGROVETREE ALL NIGHT CHAINED UP IN THE FILTHY CONVICTHUTS
BITTEN BY MOSQUITOES RACKED WITH AGUE BULLIED BY EVERY CURSED
BLACKFACED POLICEMAN WHO LOVED TO TAKE IT OUT OF A WHITE MAN THAT
WAS HOW I EARNED THE AGRA TREASURE AND YOU TALK TO ME OF JUSTICE
BECAUSE I CANNOT BEAR TO FEEL THAT I HAVE PAID THIS PRICE ONLY THAT
ANOTHER MAY ENJOY IT I WOULD RATHER SWING A SCORE OF TIMES OR HAVE
ONE OF TONGAS DARTS IN MY HIDE THAN LIVE IN A CONVICTS CELL AND
FEEL THAT ANOTHER MAN IS AT HIS EASE IN A PALACE WITH THE MONEY THAT
SHOULD BE MINE SMALL HAD DROPPED HIS MASK OF STOICISM AND ALL THIS
CAME OUT IN A WILD WHIRL OF WORDS WHILE HIS EYES BLAZED AND THE
HANDCUFFS CLANKED TOGETHER WITH THE IMPASSIONED MOVEMENT OF HIS
HANDS I COULD UNDERSTAND AS I SAW THE FURY AND THE PASSION OF THE
MAN THAT IT WAS NO GROUNDLESS OR UNNATURAL TERROR WHICH HAD
POSSESSED MAJOR SHOLTO WHEN HE FIRST LEARNED THAT THE INJURED CONVICT
WAS UPON HIS TRACK
YOU FORGET THAT WE KNOW NOTHING OF ALL THIS SAID HOLMES QUIETLY
WE HAVE NOT HEARD YOUR STORY AND WE CANNOT TELL HOW FAR JUSTICE MAY
ORIGINALLY HAVE BEEN ON YOUR SIDE
WELL SIR YOU HAVE BEEN VERY FAIRSPOKEN TO ME THOUGH I CAN SEE
THAT I HAVE YOU TO THANK THAT I HAVE THESE BRACELETS UPON MY WRISTS
STILL I BEAR NO GRUDGE FOR THAT IT IS ALL FAIR AND ABOVEBOARD IF
YOU WANT TO HEAR MY STORY I HAVE NO WISH TO HOLD IT BACK WHAT I SAY
TO YOU IS GODS TRUTH EVERY WORD OF IT THANK YOU YOU CAN PUT THE
GLASS BESIDE ME HERE AND ILL PUT MY LIPS TO IT IF I AM DRY
I AM A WORCESTERSHIRE MAN MYSELFBORN NEAR PERSHORE I DARE SAY
YOU WOULD FIND A HEAP OF SMALLS LIVING THERE NOW IF YOU WERE TO LOOK
I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT OF TAKING A LOOK ROUND THERE BUT THE TRUTH IS
THAT I WAS NEVER MUCH OF A CREDIT TO THE FAMILY AND I DOUBT IF THEY
WOULD BE SO VERY GLAD TO SEE ME THEY WERE ALL STEADY CHAPELGOING
FOLK SMALL FARMERS WELL KNOWN AND RESPECTED OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE
WHILE I WAS ALWAYS A BIT OF A ROVER AT LAST HOWEVER WHEN I WAS
ABOUT EIGHTEEN I GAVE THEM NO MORE TROUBLE FOR I GOT INTO A MESS
OVER A GIRL AND COULD ONLY GET OUT OF IT AGAIN BY TAKING THE QUEENS
SHILLING AND JOINING THE D BUFFS WHICH WAS JUST STARTING FOR INDIA
I WASNT DESTINED TO DO MUCH SOLDIERING HOWEVER I HAD JUST GOT
PAST THE GOOSESTEP AND LEARNED TO HANDLE MY MUSKET WHEN I WAS FOOL
ENOUGH TO GO SWIMMING IN THE GANGES LUCKILY FOR ME MY COMPANY
SERGEANT JOHN HOLDER WAS IN THE WATER AT THE SAME TIME AND HE WAS
ONE OF THE FINEST SWIMMERS IN THE SERVICE A CROCODILE TOOK ME JUST
AS I WAS HALFWAY ACROSS AND NIPPED OFF MY RIGHT LEG AS CLEAN AS A
SURGEON COULD HAVE DONE IT JUST ABOVE THE KNEE WHAT WITH THE SHOCK
AND THE LOSS OF BLOOD I FAINTED AND SHOULD HAVE DROWNED IF HOLDER
HAD NOT CAUGHT HOLD OF ME AND PADDLED FOR THE BANK I WAS FIVE MONTHS
IN HOSPITAL OVER IT AND WHEN AT LAST I WAS ABLE TO LIMP OUT OF IT
WITH THIS TIMBER TOE STRAPPED TO MY STUMP I FOUND MYSELF INVALIDED
OUT OF THE ARMY AND UNFITTED FOR ANY ACTIVE OCCUPATION
I WAS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE PRETTY DOWN ON MY LUCK AT THIS TIME FOR
I WAS A USELESS CRIPPLE THOUGH NOT YET IN MY TWENTIETH YEAR HOWEVER
MY MISFORTUNE SOON PROVED TO BE A BLESSING IN DISGUISE A MAN NAMED
ABELWHITE WHO HAD COME OUT THERE AS AN INDIGOPLANTER WANTED AN
OVERSEER TO LOOK AFTER HIS COOLIES AND KEEP THEM UP TO THEIR WORK HE
HAPPENED TO BE A FRIEND OF OUR COLONELS WHO HAD TAKEN AN INTEREST
IN ME SINCE THE ACCIDENT TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT THE COLONEL
RECOMMENDED ME STRONGLY FOR THE POST AND AS THE WORK WAS MOSTLY TO
BE DONE ON HORSEBACK MY LEG WAS NO GREAT OBSTACLE FOR I HAD ENOUGH
KNEE LEFT TO KEEP GOOD GRIP ON THE SADDLE WHAT I HAD TO DO WAS TO
RIDE OVER THE PLANTATION TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE MEN AS THEY WORKED
AND TO REPORT THE IDLERS THE PAY WAS FAIR I HAD COMFORTABLE
QUARTERS AND ALTOGETHER I WAS CONTENT TO SPEND THE REMAINDER OF MY
LIFE IN INDIGOPLANTING MR ABELWHITE WAS A KIND MAN AND HE WOULD
OFTEN DROP INTO MY LITTLE SHANTY AND SMOKE A PIPE WITH ME FOR WHITE
FOLK OUT THERE FEEL THEIR HEARTS WARM TO EACH OTHER AS THEY NEVER DO
HERE AT HOME
WELL I WAS NEVER IN LUCKS WAY LONG SUDDENLY WITHOUT A NOTE OF
WARNING THE GREAT MUTINY BROKE UPON US ONE MONTH INDIA LAY AS STILL
AND PEACEFUL TO ALL APPEARANCE AS SURREY OR KENT THE NEXT THERE
WERE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BLACK DEVILS LET LOOSE AND THE COUNTRY WAS
A PERFECT HELL OF COURSE YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT GENTLEMENA DEAL
MORE THAN I DO VERY LIKE SINCE READING IS NOT IN MY LINE I ONLY
KNOW WHAT I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES OUR PLANTATION WAS AT A PLACE
CALLED MUTTRA NEAR THE BORDER OF THE NORTHWEST PROVINCES NIGHT
AFTER NIGHT THE WHOLE SKY WAS ALIGHT WITH THE BURNING BUNGALOWS AND
DAY AFTER DAY WE HAD SMALL COMPANIES OF EUROPEANS PASSING THROUGH OUR
ESTATE WITH THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN ON THEIR WAY TO AGRA WHERE
WERE THE NEAREST TROOPS MR ABELWHITE WAS AN OBSTINATE MAN HE HAD
IT IN HIS HEAD THAT THE AFFAIR HAD BEEN EXAGGERATED AND THAT IT
WOULD BLOW OVER AS SUDDENLY AS IT HAD SPRUNG UP THERE HE SAT ON HIS
VERANDA DRINKING WHISKEYPEGS AND SMOKING CHEROOTS WHILE THE
COUNTRY WAS IN A BLAZE ABOUT HIM OF COURSE WE STUCK BY HIM I AND
DAWSON WHO WITH HIS WIFE USED TO DO THE BOOKWORK AND THE
MANAGING WELL ONE FINE DAY THE CRASH CAME I HAD BEEN AWAY ON A
DISTANT PLANTATION AND WAS RIDING SLOWLY HOME IN THE EVENING WHEN
MY EYE FELL UPON SOMETHING ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER AT THE BOTTOM OF A
STEEP NULLAH I RODE DOWN TO SEE WHAT IT WAS AND THE COLD STRUCK
THROUGH MY HEART WHEN I FOUND IT WAS DAWSONS WIFE ALL CUT INTO
RIBBONS AND HALF EATEN BY JACKALS AND NATIVE DOGS A LITTLE FURTHER
UP THE ROAD DAWSON HIMSELF WAS LYING ON HIS FACE QUITE DEAD WITH AN
EMPTY REVOLVER IN HIS HAND AND FOUR SEPOYS LYING ACROSS EACH OTHER IN
FRONT OF HIM I REINED UP MY HORSE WONDERING WHICH WAY I SHOULD
TURN BUT AT THAT MOMENT I SAW THICK SMOKE CURLING UP FROM
ABELWHITES BUNGALOW AND THE FLAMES BEGINNING TO BURST THROUGH THE
ROOF I KNEW THEN THAT I COULD DO MY EMPLOYER NO GOOD BUT WOULD ONLY
THROW MY OWN LIFE AWAY IF I MEDDLED IN THE MATTER FROM WHERE I STOOD
I COULD SEE HUNDREDS OF THE BLACK FIENDS WITH THEIR RED COATS STILL
ON THEIR BACKS DANCING AND HOWLING ROUND THE BURNING HOUSE SOME OF
THEM POINTED AT ME AND A COUPLE OF BULLETS SANG PAST MY HEAD SO I
BROKE AWAY ACROSS THE PADDYFIELDS AND FOUND MYSELF LATE AT NIGHT
SAFE WITHIN THE WALLS AT AGRA
AS IT PROVED HOWEVER THERE WAS NO GREAT SAFETY THERE EITHER THE
WHOLE COUNTRY WAS UP LIKE A SWARM OF BEES WHEREVER THE ENGLISH COULD
COLLECT IN LITTLE BANDS THEY HELD JUST THE GROUND THAT THEIR GUNS
COMMANDED EVERYWHERE ELSE THEY WERE HELPLESS FUGITIVES IT WAS A
FIGHT OF THE MILLIONS AGAINST THE HUNDREDS AND THE CRUELLEST PART OF
IT WAS THAT THESE MEN THAT WE FOUGHT AGAINST FOOT HORSE AND
GUNNERS WERE OUR OWN PICKED TROOPS WHOM WE HAD TAUGHT AND TRAINED
HANDLING OUR OWN WEAPONS AND BLOWING OUR OWN BUGLECALLS AT AGRA
THERE WERE THE D BENGAL FUSILIERS SOME SIKHS TWO TROOPS OF HORSE
AND A BATTERY OF ARTILLERY A VOLUNTEER CORPS OF CLERKS AND MERCHANTS
HAD BEEN FORMED AND THIS I JOINED WOODEN LEG AND ALL WE WENT OUT
TO MEET THE REBELS AT SHAHGUNGE EARLY IN JULY AND WE BEAT THEM BACK
FOR A TIME BUT OUR POWDER GAVE OUT AND WE HAD TO FALL BACK UPON THE
CITY NOTHING BUT THE WORST NEWS CAME TO US FROM EVERY SIDEWHICH
IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT FOR IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP YOU WILL SEE
THAT WE WERE RIGHT IN THE HEART OF IT LUCKNOW IS RATHER BETTER THAN
A HUNDRED MILES TO THE EAST AND CAWNPORE ABOUT AS FAR TO THE SOUTH
FROM EVERY POINT ON THE COMPASS THERE WAS NOTHING BUT TORTURE AND
MURDER AND OUTRAGE
THE CITY OF AGRA IS A GREAT PLACE SWARMING WITH FANATICS AND FIERCE
DEVILWORSHIPPERS OF ALL SORTS OUR HANDFUL OF MEN WERE LOST AMONG
THE NARROW WINDING STREETS OUR LEADER MOVED ACROSS THE RIVER
THEREFORE AND TOOK UP HIS POSITION IN THE OLD FORT AT AGRA I DONT
KNOW IF ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN HAVE EVER READ OR HEARD ANYTHING OF THAT
OLD FORT IT IS A VERY QUEER PLACETHE QUEEREST THAT EVER I WAS IN
AND I HAVE BEEN IN SOME RUM CORNERS TOO FIRST OF ALL IT IS
ENORMOUS IN SIZE I SHOULD THINK THAT THE ENCLOSURE MUST BE ACRES AND
ACRES THERE IS A MODERN PART WHICH TOOK ALL OUR GARRISON WOMEN
CHILDREN STORES AND EVERYTHING ELSE WITH PLENTY OF ROOM OVER BUT
THE MODERN PART IS NOTHING LIKE THE SIZE OF THE OLD QUARTER WHERE
NOBODY GOES AND WHICH IS GIVEN OVER TO THE SCORPIONS AND THE
CENTIPEDES IT IS ALL FULL OF GREAT DESERTED HALLS AND WINDING
PASSAGES AND LONG CORRIDORS TWISTING IN AND OUT SO THAT IT IS EASY
ENOUGH FOR FOLK TO GET LOST IN IT FOR THIS REASON IT WAS SELDOM THAT
ANY ONE WENT INTO IT THOUGH NOW AND AGAIN A PARTY WITH TORCHES MIGHT
GO EXPLORING
THE RIVER WASHES ALONG THE FRONT OF THE OLD FORT AND SO PROTECTS
IT BUT ON THE SIDES AND BEHIND THERE ARE MANY DOORS AND THESE HAD
TO BE GUARDED OF COURSE IN THE OLD QUARTER AS WELL AS IN THAT WHICH
WAS ACTUALLY HELD BY OUR TROOPS WE WERE SHORTHANDED WITH HARDLY
MEN ENOUGH TO MAN THE ANGLES OF THE BUILDING AND TO SERVE THE GUNS
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US THEREFORE TO STATION A STRONG GUARD AT
EVERY ONE OF THE INNUMERABLE GATES WHAT WE DID WAS TO ORGANIZE A
CENTRAL GUARDHOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FORT AND TO LEAVE EACH GATE
UNDER THE CHARGE OF ONE WHITE MAN AND TWO OR THREE NATIVES I WAS
SELECTED TO TAKE CHARGE DURING CERTAIN HOURS OF THE NIGHT OF A SMALL
ISOLATED DOOR UPON THE SOUTHWEST SIDE OF THE BUILDING TWO SIKH
TROOPERS WERE PLACED UNDER MY COMMAND AND I WAS INSTRUCTED IF
ANYTHING WENT WRONG TO FIRE MY MUSKET WHEN I MIGHT RELY UPON HELP
COMING AT ONCE FROM THE CENTRAL GUARD AS THE GUARD WAS A GOOD TWO
HUNDRED PACES AWAY HOWEVER AND AS THE SPACE BETWEEN WAS CUT UP INTO
A LABYRINTH OF PASSAGES AND CORRIDORS I HAD GREAT DOUBTS AS TO
WHETHER THEY COULD ARRIVE IN TIME TO BE OF ANY USE IN CASE OF AN
ACTUAL ATTACK
WELL I WAS PRETTY PROUD AT HAVING THIS SMALL COMMAND GIVEN ME
SINCE I WAS A RAW RECRUIT AND A GAMELEGGED ONE AT THAT FOR TWO
NIGHTS I KEPT THE WATCH WITH MY PUNJAUBEES THEY WERE TALL
FIERCELOOKING CHAPS MAHOMET SINGH AND ABDULLAH KHAN BY NAME BOTH
OLD FIGHTINGMEN WHO HAD BORNE ARMS AGAINST US AT CHILIANWALLAH
THEY COULD TALK ENGLISH PRETTY WELL BUT I COULD GET LITTLE OUT OF
THEM THEY PREFERRED TO STAND TOGETHER AND JABBER ALL NIGHT IN THEIR
QUEER SIKH LINGO FOR MYSELF I USED TO STAND OUTSIDE THE GATEWAY
LOOKING DOWN ON THE BROAD WINDING RIVER AND ON THE TWINKLING LIGHTS
OF THE GREAT CITY THE BEATING OF DRUMS THE RATTLE OF TOMTOMS AND
THE YELLS AND HOWLS OF THE REBELS DRUNK WITH OPIUM AND WITH BANG
WERE ENOUGH TO REMIND US ALL NIGHT OF OUR DANGEROUS NEIGHBORS ACROSS
THE STREAM EVERY TWO HOURS THE OFFICER OF THE NIGHT USED TO COME
ROUND TO ALL THE POSTS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL WAS WELL
THE THIRD NIGHT OF MY WATCH WAS DARK AND DIRTY WITH A SMALL
DRIVING RAIN IT WAS DREARY WORK STANDING IN THE GATEWAY HOUR AFTER
HOUR IN SUCH WEATHER I TRIED AGAIN AND AGAIN TO MAKE MY SIKHS TALK
BUT WITHOUT MUCH SUCCESS AT TWO IN THE MORNING THE ROUNDS PASSED
AND BROKE FOR A MOMENT THE WEARINESS OF THE NIGHT FINDING THAT MY
COMPANIONS WOULD NOT BE LED INTO CONVERSATION I TOOK OUT MY PIPE
AND LAID DOWN MY MUSKET TO STRIKE THE MATCH IN AN INSTANT THE TWO
SIKHS WERE UPON ME ONE OF THEM SNATCHED MY FIRELOCK UP AND LEVELLED
IT AT MY HEAD WHILE THE OTHER HELD A GREAT KNIFE TO MY THROAT AND
SWORE BETWEEN HIS TEETH THAT HE WOULD PLUNGE IT INTO ME IF I MOVED A
STEP
MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT THESE FELLOWS WERE IN LEAGUE WITH THE
REBELS AND THAT THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF AN ASSAULT IF OUR DOOR
WERE IN THE HANDS OF THE SEPOYS THE PLACE MUST FALL AND THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN BE TREATED AS THEY WERE IN CAWNPORE MAYBE YOU GENTLEMEN
THINK THAT I AM JUST MAKING OUT A CASE FOR MYSELF BUT I GIVE YOU MY
WORD THAT WHEN I THOUGHT OF THAT THOUGH I FELT THE POINT OF THE
KNIFE AT MY THROAT I OPENED MY MOUTH WITH THE INTENTION OF GIVING A
SCREAM IF IT WAS MY LAST ONE WHICH MIGHT ALARM THE MAIN GUARD THE
MAN WHO HELD ME SEEMED TO KNOW MY THOUGHTS FOR EVEN AS I BRACED
MYSELF TO IT HE WHISPERED DONT MAKE A NOISE THE FORT IS SAFE
ENOUGH THERE ARE NO REBEL DOGS ON THIS SIDE OF THE RIVER THERE WAS
THE RING OF TRUTH IN WHAT HE SAID AND I KNEW THAT IF I RAISED MY
VOICE I WAS A DEAD MAN I COULD READ IT IN THE FELLOWS BROWN EYES I
WAITED THEREFORE IN SILENCE TO SEE WHAT IT WAS THAT THEY WANTED
FROM ME
LISTEN TO ME SAHIB SAID THE TALLER AND FIERCER OF THE PAIR THE
ONE WHOM THEY CALLED ABDULLAH KHAN YOU MUST EITHER BE WITH US NOW
OR YOU MUST BE SILENCED FOREVER THE THING IS TOO GREAT A ONE FOR US
TO HESITATE EITHER YOU ARE HEART AND SOUL WITH US ON YOUR OATH ON
THE CROSS OF THE CHRISTIANS OR YOUR BODY THIS NIGHT SHALL BE THROWN
INTO THE DITCH AND WE SHALL PASS OVER TO OUR BROTHERS IN THE REBEL
ARMY THERE IS NO MIDDLE WAY WHICH IS IT TO BE DEATH OR LIFE WE
CAN ONLY GIVE YOU THREE MINUTES TO DECIDE FOR THE TIME IS PASSING
AND ALL MUST BE DONE BEFORE THE ROUNDS COME AGAIN
HOW CAN I DECIDE SAID I YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME WHAT YOU WANT OF
ME BUT I TELL YOU NOW THAT IF IT IS ANYTHING AGAINST THE SAFETY OF
THE FORT I WILL HAVE NO TRUCK WITH IT SO YOU CAN DRIVE HOME YOUR
KNIFE AND WELCOME
IT IS NOTHING AGAINST THE FORT SAID HE WE ONLY ASK YOU TO DO
THAT WHICH YOUR COUNTRYMEN COME TO THIS LAND FOR WE ASK YOU TO BE
RICH IF YOU WILL BE ONE OF US THIS NIGHT WE WILL SWEAR TO YOU UPON
THE NAKED KNIFE AND BY THE THREEFOLD OATH WHICH NO SIKH WAS EVER
KNOWN TO BREAK THAT YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR FAIR SHARE OF THE LOOT A
QUARTER OF THE TREASURE SHALL BE YOURS WE CAN SAY NO FAIRER
BUT WHAT IS THE TREASURE THEN I ASKED I AM AS READY TO BE RICH
AS YOU CAN BE IF YOU WILL BUT SHOW ME HOW IT CAN BE DONE
YOU WILL SWEAR THEN SAID HE BY THE BONES OF YOUR FATHER BY
THE HONOR OF YOUR MOTHER BY THE CROSS OF YOUR FAITH TO RAISE NO
HAND AND SPEAK NO WORD AGAINST US EITHER NOW OR AFTERWARDS
I WILL SWEAR IT I ANSWERED PROVIDED THAT THE FORT IS NOT
ENDANGERED
THEN MY COMRADE AND I WILL SWEAR THAT YOU SHALL HAVE A QUARTER OF
THE TREASURE WHICH SHALL BE EQUALLY DIVIDED AMONG THE FOUR OF US
THERE ARE BUT THREE SAID I
NO DOST AKBAR MUST HAVE HIS SHARE WE CAN TELL THE TALE TO YOU
WHILE WE AWAIT THEM DO YOU STAND AT THE GATE MAHOMET SINGH AND
GIVE NOTICE OF THEIR COMING THE THING STANDS THUS SAHIB AND I TELL
IT TO YOU BECAUSE I KNOW THAT AN OATH IS BINDING UPON A FERINGHEE
AND THAT WE MAY TRUST YOU HAD YOU BEEN A LYING HINDOO THOUGH YOU
HAD SWORN BY ALL THE GODS IN THEIR FALSE TEMPLES YOUR BLOOD WOULD
HAVE BEEN UPON THE KNIFE AND YOUR BODY IN THE WATER BUT THE SIKH
KNOWS THE ENGLISHMAN AND THE ENGLISHMAN KNOWS THE SIKH HEARKEN
THEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
THERE IS A RAJAH IN THE NORTHERN PROVINCES WHO HAS MUCH WEALTH
THOUGH HIS LANDS ARE SMALL MUCH HAS COME TO HIM FROM HIS FATHER AND
MORE STILL HE HAS SET BY HIMSELF FOR HE IS OF A LOW NATURE AND
HOARDS HIS GOLD RATHER THAN SPEND IT WHEN THE TROUBLES BROKE OUT HE
WOULD BE FRIENDS BOTH WITH THE LION AND THE TIGERWITH THE SEPOY
AND WITH THE COMPANYS RAJ SOON HOWEVER IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE
WHITE MENS DAY WAS COME FOR THROUGH ALL THE LAND HE COULD HEAR OF
NOTHING BUT OF THEIR DEATH AND THEIR OVERTHROW YET BEING A CAREFUL
MAN HE MADE SUCH PLANS THAT COME WHAT MIGHT HALF AT LEAST OF HIS
TREASURE SHOULD BE LEFT TO HIM THAT WHICH WAS IN GOLD AND SILVER HE
KEPT BY HIM IN THE VAULTS OF HIS PALACE BUT THE MOST PRECIOUS STONES
AND THE CHOICEST PEARLS THAT HE HAD HE PUT IN AN IRON BOX AND SENT
IT BY A TRUSTY SERVANT WHO UNDER THE GUISE OF A MERCHANT SHOULD
TAKE IT TO THE FORT AT AGRA THERE TO LIE UNTIL THE LAND IS AT PEACE
THUS IF THE REBELS WON HE WOULD HAVE HIS MONEY BUT IF THE COMPANY
CONQUERED HIS JEWELS WOULD BE SAVED TO HIM HAVING THUS DIVIDED HIS
HOARD HE THREW HIMSELF INTO THE CAUSE OF THE SEPOYS SINCE THEY WERE
STRONG UPON HIS BORDERS BY DOING THIS MARK YOU SAHIB HIS PROPERTY
BECOMES THE DUE OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TRUE TO THEIR SALT
THIS PRETENDED MERCHANT WHO TRAVELS UNDER THE NAME OF ACHMET IS
NOW IN THE CITY OF AGRA AND DESIRES TO GAIN HIS WAY INTO THE FORT
HE HAS WITH HIM AS TRAVELLINGCOMPANION MY FOSTERBROTHER DOST AKBAR
WHO KNOWS HIS SECRET DOST AKBAR HAS PROMISED THIS NIGHT TO LEAD HIM
TO A SIDEPOSTERN OF THE FORT AND HAS CHOSEN THIS ONE FOR HIS
PURPOSE HERE HE WILL COME PRESENTLY AND HERE HE WILL FIND MAHOMET
SINGH AND MYSELF AWAITING HIM THE PLACE IS LONELY AND NONE SHALL
KNOW OF HIS COMING THE WORLD SHALL KNOW OF THE MERCHANT ACHMET NO
MORE BUT THE GREAT TREASURE OF THE RAJAH SHALL BE DIVIDED AMONG US
WHAT SAY YOU TO IT SAHIB
IN WORCESTERSHIRE THE LIFE OF A MAN SEEMS A GREAT AND A SACRED
THING BUT IT IS VERY DIFFERENT WHEN THERE IS FIRE AND BLOOD ALL
ROUND YOU AND YOU HAVE BEEN USED TO MEETING DEATH AT EVERY TURN
WHETHER ACHMET THE MERCHANT LIVED OR DIED WAS A THING AS LIGHT AS AIR
TO ME BUT AT THE TALK ABOUT THE TREASURE MY HEART TURNED TO IT AND
I THOUGHT OF WHAT I MIGHT DO IN THE OLD COUNTRY WITH IT AND HOW MY
FOLK WOULD STARE WHEN THEY SAW THEIR NEERDOWELL COMING BACK WITH
HIS POCKETS FULL OF GOLD MOIDORES I HAD THEREFORE ALREADY MADE UP
MY MIND ABDULLAH KHAN HOWEVER THINKING THAT I HESITATED PRESSED
THE MATTER MORE CLOSELY
CONSIDER SAHIB SAID HE THAT IF THIS MAN IS TAKEN BY THE
COMMANDANT HE WILL BE HUNG OR SHOT AND HIS JEWELS TAKEN BY THE
GOVERNMENT SO THAT NO MAN WILL BE A RUPEE THE BETTER FOR THEM NOW
SINCE WE DO THE TAKING OF HIM WHY SHOULD WE NOT DO THE REST AS WELL
THE JEWELS WILL BE AS WELL WITH US AS IN THE COMPANYS COFFERS THERE
WILL BE ENOUGH TO MAKE EVERY ONE OF US RICH MEN AND GREAT CHIEFS NO
ONE CAN KNOW ABOUT THE MATTER FOR HERE WE ARE CUT OFF FROM ALL MEN
WHAT COULD BE BETTER FOR THE PURPOSE SAY AGAIN THEN SAHIB
WHETHER YOU ARE WITH US OR IF WE MUST LOOK UPON YOU AS AN ENEMY
I AM WITH YOU HEART AND SOUL SAID I
IT IS WELL HE ANSWERED HANDING ME BACK MY FIRELOCK YOU SEE
THAT WE TRUST YOU FOR YOUR WORD LIKE OURS IS NOT TO BE BROKEN WE
HAVE NOW ONLY TO WAIT FOR MY BROTHER AND THE MERCHANT
DOES YOUR BROTHER KNOW THEN OF WHAT YOU WILL DO I ASKED
THE PLAN IS HIS HE HAS DEVISED IT WE WILL GO TO THE GATE AND
SHARE THE WATCH WITH MAHOMET SINGH
THE RAIN WAS STILL FALLING STEADILY FOR IT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING
OF THE WET SEASON BROWN HEAVY CLOUDS WERE DRIFTING ACROSS THE SKY
AND IT WAS HARD TO SEE MORE THAN A STONECAST A DEEP MOAT LAY IN
FRONT OF OUR DOOR BUT THE WATER WAS IN PLACES NEARLY DRIED UP AND
IT COULD EASILY BE CROSSED IT WAS STRANGE TO ME TO BE STANDING THERE
WITH THOSE TWO WILD PUNJAUBEES WAITING FOR THE MAN WHO WAS COMING TO
HIS DEATH
SUDDENLY MY EYE CAUGHT THE GLINT OF A SHADED LANTERN AT THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE MOAT IT VANISHED AMONG THE MOUNDHEAPS AND THEN
APPEARED AGAIN COMING SLOWLY IN OUR DIRECTION
HERE THEY ARE I EXCLAIMED
YOU WILL CHALLENGE HIM SAHIB AS USUAL WHISPERED ABDULLAH GIVE
HIM NO CAUSE FOR FEAR SEND US IN WITH HIM AND WE SHALL DO THE REST
WHILE YOU STAY HERE ON GUARD HAVE THE LANTERN READY TO UNCOVER THAT
WE MAY BE SURE THAT IT IS INDEED THE MAN
THE LIGHT HAD FLICKERED ONWARDS NOW STOPPING AND NOW ADVANCING
UNTIL I COULD SEE TWO DARK FIGURES UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOAT I
LET THEM SCRAMBLE DOWN THE SLOPING BANK SPLASH THROUGH THE MIRE AND
CLIMB HALFWAY UP TO THE GATE BEFORE I CHALLENGED THEM
WHO GOES THERE SAID I IN A SUBDUED VOICE
FRIENDS CAME THE ANSWER I UNCOVERED MY LANTERN AND THREW A FLOOD
OF LIGHT UPON THEM THE FIRST WAS AN ENORMOUS SIKH WITH A BLACK
BEARD WHICH SWEPT NEARLY DOWN TO HIS CUMMERBUND OUTSIDE OF A SHOW I
HAVE NEVER SEEN SO TALL A MAN THE OTHER WAS A LITTLE FAT ROUND
FELLOW WITH A GREAT YELLOW TURBAN AND A BUNDLE IN HIS HAND DONE UP
IN A SHAWL HE SEEMED TO BE ALL IN A QUIVER WITH FEAR FOR HIS HANDS
TWITCHED AS IF HE HAD THE AGUE AND HIS HEAD KEPT TURNING TO LEFT AND
RIGHT WITH TWO BRIGHT LITTLE TWINKLING EYES LIKE A MOUSE WHEN HE
VENTURES OUT FROM HIS HOLE IT GAVE ME THE CHILLS TO THINK OF KILLING
HIM BUT I THOUGHT OF THE TREASURE AND MY HEART SET AS HARD AS A
FLINT WITHIN ME WHEN HE SAW MY WHITE FACE HE GAVE A LITTLE CHIRRUP
OF JOY AND CAME RUNNING UP TOWARDS ME
YOUR PROTECTION SAHIB HE PANTEDYOUR PROTECTION FOR THE
UNHAPPY MERCHANT ACHMET I HAVE TRAVELLED ACROSS RAJPOOTANA THAT I
MIGHT SEEK THE SHELTER OF THE FORT AT AGRA I HAVE BEEN ROBBED AND
BEATEN AND ABUSED BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN THE FRIEND OF THE COMPANY IT
IS A BLESSED NIGHT THIS WHEN I AM ONCE MORE IN SAFETYI AND MY POOR
POSSESSIONS
WHAT HAVE YOU IN THE BUNDLE I ASKED
AN IRON BOX HE ANSWERED WHICH CONTAINS ONE OR TWO LITTLE FAMILY
MATTERS WHICH ARE OF NO VALUE TO OTHERS BUT WHICH I SHOULD BE SORRY
TO LOSE YET I AM NOT A BEGGAR AND I SHALL REWARD YOU YOUNG SAHIB
AND YOUR GOVERNOR ALSO IF HE WILL GIVE ME THE SHELTER I ASK
I COULD NOT TRUST MYSELF TO SPEAK LONGER WITH THE MAN THE MORE I
LOOKED AT HIS FAT FRIGHTENED FACE THE HARDER DID IT SEEM THAT WE
SHOULD SLAY HIM IN COLD BLOOD IT WAS BEST TO GET IT OVER
TAKE HIM TO THE MAIN GUARD SAID I THE TWO SIKHS CLOSED IN UPON
HIM ON EACH SIDE AND THE GIANT WALKED BEHIND WHILE THEY MARCHED IN
THROUGH THE DARK GATEWAY NEVER WAS A MAN SO COMPASSED ROUND WITH
DEATH I REMAINED AT THE GATEWAY WITH THE LANTERN
I COULD HEAR THE MEASURED TRAMP OF THEIR FOOTSTEPS SOUNDING THROUGH
THE LONELY CORRIDORS SUDDENLY IT CEASED AND I HEARD VOICES AND A
SCUFFLE WITH THE SOUND OF BLOWS A MOMENT LATER THERE CAME TO MY
HORROR A RUSH OF FOOTSTEPS COMING IN MY DIRECTION WITH THE LOUD
BREATHING OF A RUNNING MAN I TURNED MY LANTERN DOWN THE LONG
STRAIGHT PASSAGE AND THERE WAS THE FAT MAN RUNNING LIKE THE WIND
WITH A SMEAR OF BLOOD ACROSS HIS FACE AND CLOSE AT HIS HEELS
BOUNDING LIKE A TIGER THE GREAT BLACKBEARDED SIKH WITH A KNIFE
FLASHING IN HIS HAND I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MAN RUN SO FAST AS THAT
LITTLE MERCHANT HE WAS GAINING ON THE SIKH AND I COULD SEE THAT IF
HE ONCE PASSED ME AND GOT TO THE OPEN AIR HE WOULD SAVE HIMSELF YET
MY HEART SOFTENED TO HIM BUT AGAIN THE THOUGHT OF HIS TREASURE
TURNED ME HARD AND BITTER I CAST MY FIRELOCK BETWEEN HIS LEGS AS HE
RACED PAST AND HE ROLLED TWICE OVER LIKE A SHOT RABBIT ERE HE COULD
STAGGER TO HIS FEET THE SIKH WAS UPON HIM AND BURIED HIS KNIFE TWICE
IN HIS SIDE THE MAN NEVER UTTERED MOAN NOR MOVED MUSCLE BUT LAY
WERE HE HAD FALLEN I THINK MYSELF THAT HE MAY HAVE BROKEN HIS NECK
WITH THE FALL YOU SEE GENTLEMEN THAT I AM KEEPING MY PROMISE I AM
TELLING YOU EVERY WORK OF THE BUSINESS JUST EXACTLY AS IT HAPPENED
WHETHER IT IS IN MY FAVOR OR NOT
HE STOPPED AND HELD OUT HIS MANACLED HANDS FOR THE WHISKEYANDWATER
WHICH HOLMES HAD BREWED FOR HIM FOR MYSELF I CONFESS THAT I HAD NOW
CONCEIVED THE UTMOST HORROR OF THE MAN NOT ONLY FOR THIS
COLDBLOODED BUSINESS IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONCERNED BUT EVEN MORE
FOR THE SOMEWHAT FLIPPANT AND CARELESS WAY IN WHICH HE NARRATED IT
WHATEVER PUNISHMENT WAS IN STORE FOR HIM I FELT THAT HE MIGHT EXPECT
NO SYMPATHY FROM ME SHERLOCK HOLMES AND JONES SAT WITH THEIR HANDS
UPON THEIR KNEES DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE STORY BUT WITH THE SAME
DISGUST WRITTEN UPON THEIR FACES HE MAY HAVE OBSERVED IT FOR THERE
WAS A TOUCH OF DEFIANCE IN HIS VOICE AND MANNER AS HE PROCEEDED
IT WAS ALL VERY BAD NO DOUBT SAID HE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW
MANY FELLOWS IN MY SHOES WOULD HAVE REFUSED A SHARE OF THIS LOOT WHEN
THEY KNEW THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR THROATS CUT FOR THEIR PAINS
BESIDES IT WAS MY LIFE OR HIS WHEN ONCE HE WAS IN THE FORT IF HE
HAD GOT OUT THE WHOLE BUSINESS WOULD COME TO LIGHT AND I SHOULD
HAVE BEEN COURTMARTIALLED AND SHOT AS LIKELY AS NOT FOR PEOPLE WERE
NOT VERY LENIENT AT A TIME LIKE THAT
GO ON WITH YOUR STORY SAID HOLMES SHORTLY
WELL WE CARRIED HIM IN ABDULLAH AKBAR AND I A FINE WEIGHT HE
WAS TOO FOR ALL THAT HE WAS SO SHORT MAHOMET SINGH WAS LEFT TO
GUARD THE DOOR WE TOOK HIM TO A PLACE WHICH THE SIKHS HAD ALREADY
PREPARED IT WAS SOME DISTANCE OFF WHERE A WINDING PASSAGE LEADS TO
A GREAT EMPTY HALL THE BRICK WALLS OF WHICH WERE ALL CRUMBLING TO
PIECES THE EARTH FLOOR HAD SUNK IN AT ONE PLACE MAKING A NATURAL
GRAVE SO WE LEFT ACHMET THE MERCHANT THERE HAVING FIRST COVERED HIM
OVER WITH LOOSE BRICKS THIS DONE WE ALL WENT BACK TO THE TREASURE
IT LAY WHERE HE HAD DROPPED IT WHEN HE WAS FIRST ATTACKED THE BOX
WAS THE SAME WHICH NOW LIES OPEN UPON YOUR TABLE A KEY WAS HUNG BY A
SILKEN CORD TO THAT CARVED HANDLE UPON THE TOP WE OPENED IT AND THE
LIGHT OF THE LANTERN GLEAMED UPON A COLLECTION OF GEMS SUCH AS I HAVE
READ OF AND THOUGHT ABOUT WHEN I WAS A LITTLE LAD AT PERSHORE IT WAS
BLINDING TO LOOK UPON THEM WHEN WE HAD FEASTED OUR EYES WE TOOK THEM
ALL OUT AND MADE A LIST OF THEM THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED AND
FORTYTHREE DIAMONDS OF THE FIRST WATER INCLUDING ONE WHICH HAS BEEN
CALLED I BELIEVE THE GREAT MOGUL AND IS SAID TO BE THE SECOND
LARGEST STONE IN EXISTENCE THEN THERE WERE NINETYSEVEN VERY FINE
EMERALDS AND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY RUBIES SOME OF WHICH HOWEVER
WERE SMALL THERE WERE FORTY CARBUNCLES TWO HUNDRED AND TEN
SAPPHIRES SIXTYONE AGATES AND A GREAT QUANTITY OF BERYLS ONYXES
CATSEYES TURQUOISES AND OTHER STONES THE VERY NAMES OF WHICH I
DID NOT KNOW AT THE TIME THOUGH I HAVE BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH
THEM SINCE BESIDES THIS THERE WERE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED VERY FINE
PEARLS TWELVE OF WHICH WERE SET IN A GOLD CORONET BY THE WAY THESE
LAST HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE CHEST AND WERE NOT THERE WHEN I
RECOVERED IT
AFTER WE HAD COUNTED OUR TREASURES WE PUT THEM BACK INTO THE CHEST
AND CARRIED THEM TO THE GATEWAY TO SHOW THEM TO MAHOMET SINGH THEN
WE SOLEMNLY RENEWED OUR OATH TO STAND BY EACH OTHER AND BE TRUE TO
OUR SECRET WE AGREED TO CONCEAL OUR LOOT IN A SAFE PLACE UNTIL THE
COUNTRY SHOULD BE AT PEACE AGAIN AND THEN TO DIVIDE IT EQUALLY AMONG
OURSELVES THERE WAS NO USE DIVIDING IT AT PRESENT FOR IF GEMS OF
SUCH VALUE WERE FOUND UPON US IT WOULD CAUSE SUSPICION AND THERE WAS
NO PRIVACY IN THE FORT NOR ANY PLACE WHERE WE COULD KEEP THEM WE
CARRIED THE BOX THEREFORE INTO THE SAME HALL WHERE WE HAD BURIED
THE BODY AND THERE UNDER CERTAIN BRICKS IN THE BESTPRESERVED WALL
WE MADE A HOLLOW AND PUT OUR TREASURE WE MADE CAREFUL NOTE OF THE
PLACE AND NEXT DAY I DREW FOUR PLANS ONE FOR EACH OF US AND PUT
THE SIGN OF THE FOUR OF US AT THE BOTTOM FOR WE HAD SWORN THAT WE
SHOULD EACH ALWAYS ACT FOR ALL SO THAT NONE MIGHT TAKE ADVANTAGE
THAT IS AN OATH THAT I CAN PUT MY HAND TO MY HEART AND SWEAR THAT I
HAVE NEVER BROKEN
WELL THERES NO USE MY TELLING YOU GENTLEMEN WHAT CAME OF THE
INDIAN MUTINY AFTER WILSON TOOK DELHI AND SIR COLIN RELIEVED LUCKNOW
THE BACK OF THE BUSINESS WAS BROKEN FRESH TROOPS CAME POURING IN
AND NANA SAHIB MADE HIMSELF SCARCE OVER THE FRONTIER A FLYING COLUMN
UNDER COLONEL GREATHED CAME ROUND TO AGRA AND CLEARED THE PANDIES
AWAY FROM IT PEACE SEEMED TO BE SETTLING UPON THE COUNTRY AND WE
FOUR WERE BEGINNING TO HOPE THAT THE TIME WAS AT HAND WHEN WE MIGHT
SAFELY GO OFF WITH OUR SHARES OF THE PLUNDER IN A MOMENT HOWEVER
OUR HOPES WERE SHATTERED BY OUR BEING ARRESTED AS THE MURDERERS OF
ACHMET
IT CAME ABOUT IN THIS WAY WHEN THE RAJAH PUT HIS JEWELS INTO THE
HANDS OF ACHMET HE DID IT BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT HE WAS A TRUSTY MAN
THEY ARE SUSPICIOUS FOLK IN THE EAST HOWEVER SO WHAT DOES THIS
RAJAH DO BUT TAKE A SECOND EVEN MORE TRUSTY SERVANT AND SET HIM TO
PLAY THE SPY UPON THE FIRST THIS SECOND MAN WAS ORDERED NEVER TO LET
ACHMET OUT OF HIS SIGHT AND HE FOLLOWED HIM LIKE HIS SHADOW HE WENT
AFTER HIM THAT NIGHT AND SAW HIM PASS THROUGH THE DOORWAY OF COURSE
HE THOUGHT HE HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN THE FORT AND APPLIED FOR ADMISSION
THERE HIMSELF NEXT DAY BUT COULD FIND NO TRACE OF ACHMET THIS
SEEMED TO HIM SO STRANGE THAT HE SPOKE ABOUT IT TO A SERGEANT OF
GUIDES WHO BROUGHT IT TO THE EARS OF THE COMMANDANT A THOROUGH
SEARCH WAS QUICKLY MADE AND THE BODY WAS DISCOVERED THUS AT THE
VERY MOMENT THAT WE THOUGHT THAT ALL WAS SAFE WE WERE ALL FOUR SEIZED
AND BROUGHT TO TRIAL ON A CHARGE OF MURDERTHREE OF US BECAUSE WE
HAD HELD THE GATE THAT NIGHT AND THE FOURTH BECAUSE HE WAS KNOWN TO
HAVE BEEN IN THE COMPANY OF THE MURDERED MAN NOT A WORD ABOUT THE
JEWELS CAME OUT AT THE TRIAL FOR THE RAJAH HAD BEEN DEPOSED AND
DRIVEN OUT OF INDIA SO NO ONE HAD ANY PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THEM
THE MURDER HOWEVER WAS CLEARLY MADE OUT AND IT WAS CERTAIN THAT WE
MUST ALL HAVE BEEN CONCERNED IN IT THE THREE SIKHS GOT PENAL
SERVITUDE FOR LIFE AND I WAS CONDEMNED TO DEATH THOUGH MY SENTENCE
WAS AFTERWARDS COMMUTED INTO THE SAME AS THE OTHERS
IT WAS RATHER A QUEER POSITION THAT WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THEN
THERE WE WERE ALL FOUR TIED BY THE LEG AND WITH PRECIOUS LITTLE
CHANCE OF EVER GETTING OUT AGAIN WHILE WE EACH HELD A SECRET WHICH
MIGHT HAVE PUT EACH OF US IN A PALACE IF WE COULD ONLY HAVE MADE USE
OF IT IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE A MAN EAT HIS HEART OUT TO HAVE TO STAND
THE KICK AND THE CUFF OF EVERY PETTY JACKINOFFICE TO HAVE RICE TO
EAT AND WATER TO DRINK WHEN THAT GORGEOUS FORTUNE WAS READY FOR HIM
OUTSIDE JUST WAITING TO BE PICKED UP IT MIGHT HAVE DRIVEN ME MAD
BUT I WAS ALWAYS A PRETTY STUBBORN ONE SO I JUST HELD ON AND BIDED
MY TIME
AT LAST IT SEEMED TO ME TO HAVE COME I WAS CHANGED FROM AGRA TO
MADRAS AND FROM THERE TO BLAIR ISLAND IN THE ANDAMANS THERE ARE
VERY FEW WHITE CONVICTS AT THIS SETTLEMENT AND AS I HAD BEHAVED
WELL FROM THE FIRST I SOON FOUND MYSELF A SORT OF PRIVILEGED PERSON
I WAS GIVEN A HUT IN HOPE TOWN WHICH IS A SMALL PLACE ON THE SLOPES
OF MOUNT HARRIET AND I WAS LEFT PRETTY MUCH TO MYSELF IT IS A
DREARY FEVERSTRICKEN PLACE AND ALL BEYOND OUR LITTLE CLEARINGS WAS
INFESTED WITH WILD CANNIBAL NATIVES WHO WERE READY ENOUGH TO BLOW A
POISONED DART AT US IF THEY SAW A CHANCE THERE WAS DIGGING AND
DITCHING AND YAMPLANTING AND A DOZEN OTHER THINGS TO BE DONE SO
WE WERE BUSY ENOUGH ALL DAY THOUGH IN THE EVENING WE HAD A LITTLE
TIME TO OURSELVES AMONG OTHER THINGS I LEARNED TO DISPENSE DRUGS
FOR THE SURGEON AND PICKED UP A SMATTERING OF HIS KNOWLEDGE ALL THE
TIME I WAS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A CHANCE OF ESCAPE BUT IT IS HUNDREDS
OF MILES FROM ANY OTHER LAND AND THERE IS LITTLE OR NO WIND IN THOSE
SEAS SO IT WAS A TERRIBLY DIFFICULT JOB TO GET AWAY
THE SURGEON DR SOMERTON WAS A FAST SPORTING YOUNG CHAP AND THE
OTHER YOUNG OFFICERS WOULD MEET IN HIS ROOMS OF AN EVENING AND PLAY
CARDS THE SURGERY WHERE I USED TO MAKE UP MY DRUGS WAS NEXT TO HIS
SITTINGROOM WITH A SMALL WINDOW BETWEEN US OFTEN IF I FELT
LONESOME I USED TO TURN OUT THE LAMP IN THE SURGERY AND THEN
STANDING THERE I COULD HEAR THEIR TALK AND WATCH THEIR PLAY I AM
FOND OF A HAND AT CARDS MYSELF AND IT WAS ALMOST AS GOOD AS HAVING
ONE TO WATCH THE OTHERS THERE WAS MAJOR SHOLTO CAPTAIN MORSTAN AND
LIEUTENANT BROMLEY BROWN WHO WERE IN COMMAND OF THE NATIVE TROOPS
AND THERE WAS THE SURGEON HIMSELF AND TWO OR THREE PRISONOFFICIALS
CRAFTY OLD HANDS WHO PLAYED A NICE SLY SAFE GAME A VERY SNUG LITTLE
PARTY THEY USED TO MAKE
WELL THERE WAS ONE THING WHICH VERY SOON STRUCK ME AND THAT WAS
THAT THE SOLDIERS USED ALWAYS TO LOSE AND THE CIVILIANS TO WIN MIND
I DONT SAY THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING UNFAIR BUT SO IT WAS THESE
PRISONCHAPS HAD DONE LITTLE ELSE THAN PLAY CARDS EVER SINCE THEY HAD
BEEN AT THE ANDAMANS AND THEY KNEW EACH OTHERS GAME TO A POINT
WHILE THE OTHERS JUST PLAYED TO PASS THE TIME AND THREW THEIR CARDS
DOWN ANYHOW NIGHT AFTER NIGHT THE SOLDIERS GOT UP POORER MEN AND
THE POORER THEY GOT THE MORE KEEN THEY WERE TO PLAY MAJOR SHOLTO WAS
THE HARDEST HIT HE USED TO PAY IN NOTES AND GOLD AT FIRST BUT SOON
IT CAME TO NOTES OF HAND AND FOR BIG SUMS HE SOMETIMES WOULD WIN FOR
A FEW DEALS JUST TO GIVE HIM HEART AND THEN THE LUCK WOULD SET IN
AGAINST HIM WORSE THAN EVER ALL DAY HE WOULD WANDER ABOUT AS BLACK
AS THUNDER AND HE TOOK TO DRINKING A DEAL MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR
HIM
ONE NIGHT HE LOST EVEN MORE HEAVILY THAN USUAL I WAS SITTING IN MY
HUT WHEN HE AND CAPTAIN MORSTAN CAME STUMBLING ALONG ON THE WAY TO
THEIR QUARTERS THEY WERE BOSOM FRIENDS THOSE TWO AND NEVER FAR
APART THE MAJOR WAS RAVING ABOUT HIS LOSSES
ITS ALL UP MORSTAN HE WAS SAYING AS THEY PASSED MY HUT I
SHALL HAVE TO SEND IN MY PAPERS I AM A RUINED MAN
NONSENSE OLD CHAP SAID THE OTHER SLAPPING HIM UPON THE
SHOULDER IVE HAD A NASTY FACER MYSELF BUT THAT WAS ALL I COULD
HEAR BUT IT WAS ENOUGH TO SET ME THINKING
A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER MAJOR SHOLTO WAS STROLLING ON THE BEACH SO I
TOOK THE CHANCE OF SPEAKING TO HIM
I WISH TO HAVE YOUR ADVICE MAJOR SAID I
WELL SMALL WHAT IS IT HE ASKED TAKING HIS CHEROOT FROM HIS
LIPS
I WANTED TO ASK YOU SIR SAID I WHO IS THE PROPER PERSON TO
WHOM HIDDEN TREASURE SHOULD BE HANDED OVER I KNOW WHERE HALF A
MILLION WORTH LIES AND AS I CANNOT USE IT MYSELF I THOUGHT PERHAPS
THE BEST THING THAT I COULD DO WOULD BE TO HAND IT OVER TO THE PROPER
AUTHORITIES AND THEN PERHAPS THEY WOULD GET MY SENTENCE SHORTENED
FOR ME
HALF A MILLION SMALL HE GASPED LOOKING HARD AT ME TO SEE IF I
WAS IN EARNEST
QUITE THAT SIRIN JEWELS AND PEARLS IT LIES THERE READY FOR
ANYONE AND THE QUEER THING ABOUT IT IS THAT THE REAL OWNER IS
OUTLAWED AND CANNOT HOLD PROPERTY SO THAT IT BELONGS TO THE FIRST
COMER
TO GOVERNMENT SMALL HE STAMMEREDTO GOVERNMENT BUT HE SAID
IT IN A HALTING FASHION AND I KNEW IN MY HEART THAT I HAD GOT HIM
YOU THINK THEN SIR THAT I SHOULD GIVE THE INFORMATION TO THE
GOVERNORGENERAL SAID I QUIETLY
WELL WELL YOU MUST NOT DO ANYTHING RASH OR THAT YOU MIGHT
REPENT LET ME HEAR ALL ABOUT IT SMALL GIVE ME THE FACTS
I TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY WITH SMALL CHANGES SO THAT HE COULD NOT
IDENTIFY THE PLACES WHEN I HAD FINISHED HE STOOD STOCK STILL AND
FULL OF THOUGHT I COULD SEE BY THE TWITCH OF HIS LIP THAT THERE WAS
A STRUGGLE GOING ON WITHIN HIM
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER SMALL HE SAID AT LAST YOU
MUST NOT SAY A WORD TO ANY ONE ABOUT IT AND I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN
SOON
TWO NIGHTS LATER HE AND HIS FRIEND CAPTAIN MORSTAN CAME TO MY HUT IN
THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT WITH A LANTERN
I WANT YOU JUST TO LET CAPTAIN MORSTAN HEAR THAT STORY FROM YOUR
OWN LIPS SMALL SAID HE
I REPEATED IT AS I HAD TOLD IT BEFORE
IT RINGS TRUE EH SAID HE ITS GOOD ENOUGH TO ACT UPON
CAPTAIN MORSTAN NODDED
LOOK HERE SMALL SAID THE MAJOR WE HAVE BEEN TALKING IT OVER
MY FRIEND HERE AND I AND WE HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS
SECRET OF YOURS IS HARDLY A GOVERNMENT MATTER AFTER ALL BUT IS A
PRIVATE CONCERN OF YOUR OWN WHICH OF COURSE YOU HAVE THE POWER OF
DISPOSING OF AS YOU THINK BEST NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT PRICE
WOULD YOU ASK FOR IT WE MIGHT BE INCLINED TO TAKE IT UP AND AT
LEAST LOOK INTO IT IF WE COULD AGREE AS TO TERMS HE TRIED TO SPEAK
IN A COOL CARELESS WAY BUT HIS EYES WERE SHINING WITH EXCITEMENT
AND GREED
WHY AS TO THAT GENTLEMEN I ANSWERED TRYING ALSO TO BE COOL
BUT FEELING AS EXCITED AS HE DID THERE IS ONLY ONE BARGAIN WHICH A
MAN IN MY POSITION CAN MAKE I SHALL WANT YOU TO HELP ME TO MY
FREEDOM AND TO HELP MY THREE COMPANIONS TO THEIRS WE SHALL THEN
TAKE YO INTO PARTNERSHIP AND GIVE YOU A FIFTH SHARE TO DIVIDE
BETWEEN YOU
HUM SAID HE A FIFTH SHARE THAT IS NOT VERY TEMPTING
IT WOULD COME TO FIFTY THOUSAND APIECE SAID I
BUT HOW CAN WE GAIN YOUR FREEDOM YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT YOU ASK
AN IMPOSSIBILITY
NOTHING OF THE SORT I ANSWERED I HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL OUT TO THE
LAST DETAIL THE ONLY BAR TO OUR ESCAPE IS THAT WE CAN GET NO BOAT
FIT FOR THE VOYAGE AND NO PROVISIONS TO LAST US FOR SO LONG A TIME
THERE ARE PLENTY OF LITTLE YACHTS AND YAWLS AT CALCUTTA OR MADRAS
WHICH WOULD SERVE OUR TURN WELL DO YOU BRING ONE OVER WE SHALL
ENGAGE TO GET ABOARD HER BY NIGHT AND IF YOU WILL DROP US ON ANY
PART OF THE INDIAN COAST YOU WILL HAVE DONE YOUR PART OF THE
BARGAIN
IF THERE WERE ONLY ONE HE SAID
NONE OR ALL I ANSWERED WE HAVE SWORN IT THE FOUR OF US MUST
ALWAYS ACT TOGETHER
YOU SEE MORSTAN SAID HE SMALL IS A MAN OF HIS WORD HE DOES
NOT FLINCH FROM HIS FRIEND I THINK WE MAY VERY WELL TRUST HIM
ITS A DIRTY BUSINESS THE OTHER ANSWERED YET AS YOU SAY THE
MONEY WOULD SAVE OUR COMMISSIONS HANDSOMELY
WELL SMALL SAID THE MAJOR WE MUST I SUPPOSE TRY AND MEET
YOU WE MUST FIRST OF COURSE TEST THE TRUTH OF YOUR STORY TELL ME
WHERE THE BOX IS HID AND I SHALL GET LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND GO BACK TO
INDIA IN THE MONTHLY RELIEFBOAT TO INQUIRE INTO THE AFFAIR
NOT SO FAST SAID I GROWING COLDER AS HE GOT HOT I MUST HAVE
THE CONSENT OF MY THREE COMRADES I TELL YOU THAT IT IS FOUR OR NONE
WITH US
NONSENSE HE BROKE IN WHAT HAVE THREE BLACK FELLOWS TO DO WITH
OUR AGREEMENT
BLACK OR BLUE SAID I THEY ARE IN WITH ME AND WE ALL GO
TOGETHER
WELL THE MATTER ENDED BY A SECOND MEETING AT WHICH MAHOMET SINGH
ABDULLAH KHAN AND DOST AKBAR WERE ALL PRESENT WE TALKED THE MATTER
OVER AGAIN AND AT LAST WE CAME TO AN ARRANGEMENT WE WERE TO PROVIDE
BOTH THE OFFICERS WITH CHARTS OF THE PART OF THE AGRA FORT AND MARK
THE PLACE IN THE WALL WHERE THE TREASURE WAS HID MAJOR SHOLTO WAS TO
GO TO INDIA TO TEST OUR STORY IF HE FOUND THE BOX HE WAS TO LEAVE IT
THERE TO SEND OUT A SMALL YACHT PROVISIONED FOR A VOYAGE WHICH WAS
TO LIE OFF RUTLAND ISLAND AND TO WHICH WE WERE TO MAKE OUR WAY AND
FINALLY TO RETURN TO HIS DUTIES CAPTAIN MORSTAN WAS THEN TO APPLY
FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO MEET US AT AGRA AND THERE WE WERE TO HAVE A
FINAL DIVISION OF THE TREASURE HE TAKING THE MAJORS SHARE AS WELL
AS HIS OWN ALL THIS WE SEALED BY THE MOST SOLEMN OATHS THAT THE MIND
COULD THINK OR THE LIPS UTTER I SAT UP ALL NIGHT WITH PAPER AND INK
AND BY THE MORNING I HAD THE TWO CHARTS ALL READY SIGNED WITH THE
SIGN OF FOURTHAT IS OF ABDULLAH AKBAR MAHOMET AND MYSELF
WELL GENTLEMEN I WEARY YOU WITH MY LONG STORY AND I KNOW THAT MY
FRIEND MR JONES IS IMPATIENT TO GET ME SAFELY STOWED IN CHOKEY ILL
MAKE IT AS SHORT AS I CAN THE VILLAIN SHOLTO WENT OFF TO INDIA BUT
HE NEVER CAME BACK AGAIN CAPTAIN MORSTAN SHOWED ME HIS NAME AMONG A
LIST OF PASSENGERS IN ONE OF THE MAILBOATS VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS
HIS UNCLE HAD DIED LEAVING HIM A FORTUNE AND HE HAD LEFT THE ARMY
YET HE COULD STOOP TO TREAT FIVE MEN AS HE HAD TREATED US MORSTAN
WENT OVER TO AGRA SHORTLY AFTERWARDS AND FOUND AS WE EXPECTED THAT
THE TREASURE WAS INDEED GONE THE SCOUNDREL HAD STOLEN IT ALL
WITHOUT CARRYING OUT ONE OF THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH WE HAD SOLD HIM
THE SECRET FROM THAT DAY I LIVED ONLY FOR VENGEANCE I THOUGHT OF IT
BY DAY AND I NURSED IT BY NIGHT IT BECAME AN OVERPOWERING ABSORBING
PASSION WITH ME I CARED NOTHING FOR THE LAWNOTHING FOR THE
GALLOWS TO ESCAPE TO TRACK DOWN SHOLTO TO HAVE MY HAND UPON HIS
THROATTHAT WAS MY ONE THOUGHT EVEN THE AGRA TREASURE HAD COME TO
BE A SMALLER THING IN MY MIND THAN THE SLAYING OF SHOLTO
WELL I HAVE SET MY MIND ON MANY THINGS IN THIS LIFE AND NEVER ONE
WHICH I DID NOT CARRY OUT BUT IT WAS WEARY YEARS BEFORE MY TIME
CAME I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I HAD PICKED UP SOMETHING OF MEDICINE ONE
DAY WHEN DR SOMERTON WAS DOWN WITH A FEVER A LITTLE ANDAMAN ISLANDER
WAS PICKED UP BY A CONVICTGANG IN THE WOODS HE WAS SICK TO DEATH
AND HAD GONE TO A LONELY PLACE TO DIE I TOOK HIM IN HAND THOUGH HE
WAS AS VENOMOUS AS A YOUNG SNAKE AND AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS I GOT
HIM ALL RIGHT AND ABLE TO WALK HE TOOK A KIND OF FANCY TO ME THEN
AND WOULD HARDLY GO BACK TO HIS WOODS BUT WAS ALWAYS HANGING ABOUT
MY HUT I LEARNED A LITTLE OF HIS LINGO FROM HIM AND THIS MADE HIM
ALL THE FONDER OF ME
TONGAFOR THAT WAS HIS NAMEWAS A FINE BOATMAN AND OWNED A BIG
ROOMY CANOE OF HIS OWN WHEN I FOUND THAT HE WAS DEVOTED TO ME AND
WOULD DO ANYTHING TO SERVE ME I SAW MY CHANCE OF ESCAPE I TALKED IT
OVER WITH HIM HE WAS TO BRING HIS BOAT ROUND ON A CERTAIN NIGHT TO
AN OLD WHARF WHICH WAS NEVER GUARDED AND THERE HE WAS TO PICK ME UP
I GAVE HIM DIRECTIONS TO HAVE SEVERAL GOURDS OF WATER AND A LOT OF
YAMS COCOANUTS AND SWEET POTATOES
HE WAS STANCH AND TRUE WAS LITTLE TONGA NO MAN EVER HAD A MORE
FAITHFUL MATE AT THE NIGHT NAMED HE HAD HIS BOAT AT THE WHARF AS IT
CHANCED HOWEVER THERE WAS ONE OF THE CONVICTGUARD DOWN THEREA
VILE PATHAN WHO HAD NEVER MISSED A CHANCE OF INSULTING AND INJURING
ME I HAD ALWAYS VOWED VENGEANCE AND NOW I HAD MY CHANCE IT WAS AS
IF FATE HAD PLACED HIM IN MY WAY THAT I MIGHT PAY MY DEBT BEFORE I
LEFT THE ISLAND HE STOOD ON THE BANK WITH HIS BACK TO ME AND HIS
CARBINE ON HIS SHOULDER I LOOKED ABOUT FOR A STONE TO BEAT OUT HIS
BRAINS WITH BUT NONE COULD I SEE
THEN A QUEER THOUGHT CAME INTO MY HEAD AND SHOWED ME WHERE I COULD
LAY MY HAND ON A WEAPON I SAT DOWN IN THE DARKNESS AND UNSTRAPPED MY
WOODEN LEG WITH THREE LONG HOPS I WAS ON HIM HE PUT HIS CARBINE TO
HIS SHOULDER BUT I STRUCK HIM FULL AND KNOCKED THE WHOLE FRONT OF
HIS SKULL IN YOU CAN SEE THE SPLIT IN THE WOOD NOW WHERE I HIT HIM
WE BOTH WENT DOWN TOGETHER FOR I COULD NOT KEEP MY BALANCE BUT WHEN
I GOT UP I FOUND HIM STILL LYING QUIET ENOUGH I MADE FOR THE BOAT
AND IN AN HOUR WE WERE WELL OUT AT SEA TONGA HAD BROUGHT ALL HIS
EARTHLY POSSESSIONS WITH HIM HIS ARMS AND HIS GODS AMONG OTHER
THINGS HE HAD A LONG BAMBOO SPEAR AND SOME ANDAMAN COCOANUT
MATTING WITH WHICH I MADE A SORT OF SAIL FOR TEN DAYS WE WERE
BEATING ABOUT TRUSTING TO LUCK AND ON THE ELEVENTH WE WERE PICKED
UP BY A TRADER WHICH WAS GOING FROM SINGAPORE TO JIDDAH WITH A CARGO
OF MALAY PILGRIMS THEY WERE A RUM CROWD AND TONGA AND I SOON
MANAGED TO SETTLE DOWN AMONG THEM THEY HAD ONE VERY GOOD QUALITY
THEY LET YOU ALONE AND ASKED NO QUESTIONS
WELL IF I WERE TO TELL YOU ALL THE ADVENTURES THAT MY LITTLE CHUM
AND I WENT THROUGH YOU WOULD NOT THANK ME FOR I WOULD HAVE YOU HERE
UNTIL THE SUN WAS SHINING HERE AND THERE WE DRIFTED ABOUT THE WORLD
SOMETHING ALWAYS TURNING UP TO KEEP US FROM LONDON ALL THE TIME
HOWEVER I NEVER LOST SIGHT OF MY PURPOSE I WOULD DREAM OF SHOLTO AT
NIGHT A HUNDRED TIMES I HAVE KILLED HIM IN MY SLEEP AT LAST
HOWEVER SOME THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO WE FOUND OURSELVES IN ENGLAND
I HAD NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN FINDING WHERE SHOLTO LIVED AND I SET TO
WORK TO DISCOVER WHETHER HE HAD REALIZED THE TREASURE OR IF HE STILL
HAD IT I MADE FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE WHO COULD HELP MEI NAME NO
NAMES FOR I DONT WANT TO GET ANY ONE ELSE IN A HOLEAND I SOON
FOUND THAT HE STILL HAD THE JEWELS THEN I TRIED TO GET AT HIM IN
MANY WAYS BUT HE WAS PRETTY SLY AND HAD ALWAYS TWO PRIZEFIGHTERS
BESIDES HIS SONS AND HIS KHITMUTGAR ON GUARD OVER HIM
ONE DAY HOWEVER I GOT WORD THAT HE WAS DYING I HURRIED AT ONCE TO
THE GARDEN MAD THAT HE SHOULD SLIP OUT OF MY CLUTCHES LIKE THAT
AND LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW I SAW HIM LYING IN HIS BED WITH HIS
SONS ON EACH SIDE OF HIM ID HAVE COME THROUGH AND TAKEN MY CHANCE
WITH THE THREE OF THEM ONLY EVEN AS I LOOKED AT HIM HIS JAW DROPPED
AND I KNEW THAT HE WAS GONE I GOT INTO HIS ROOM THAT SAME NIGHT
THOUGH AND I SEARCHED HIS PAPERS TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY RECORD OF
WHERE HE HAD HIDDEN OUR JEWELS THERE WAS NOT A LINE HOWEVER SO I
CAME AWAY BITTER AND SAVAGE AS A MAN COULD BE BEFORE I LEFT I
BETHOUGHT ME THAT IF I EVER MET MY SIKH FRIENDS AGAIN IT WOULD BE A
SATISFACTION TO KNOW THAT I HAD LEFT SOME MARK OF OUR HATRED SO I
SCRAWLED DOWN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR OF US AS IT HAD BEEN ON THE
CHART AND I PINNED IT ON HIS BOSOM IT WAS TOO MUCH THAT HE SHOULD
BE TAKEN TO THE GRAVE WITHOUT SOME TOKEN FROM THE MEN WHOM HE HAD
ROBBED AND BEFOOLED
WE EARNED A LIVING AT THIS TIME BY MY EXHIBITING POOR TONGA AT FAIRS
AND OTHER SUCH PLACES AS THE BLACK CANNIBAL HE WOULD EAT RAW MEAT
AND DANCE HIS WARDANCE SO WE ALWAYS HAD A HATFUL OF PENNIES AFTER A
DAYS WORK I STILL HEARD ALL THE NEWS FROM PONDICHERRY LODGE AND
FOR SOME YEARS THERE WAS NO NEWS TO HEAR EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE
HUNTING FOR THE TREASURE AT LAST HOWEVER CAME WHAT WE HAD WAITED
FOR SO LONG THE TREASURE HAD BEEN FOUND IT WAS UP AT THE TOP OF THE
HOUSE IN MR BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTOS CHEMICAL LABORATORY I CAME AT
ONCE AND HAD A LOOK AT THE PLACE BUT I COULD NOT SEE HOW WITH MY
WOODEN LEG I WAS TO MAKE MY WAY UP TO IT I LEARNED HOWEVER ABOUT A
TRAPDOOR IN THE ROOF AND ALSO ABOUT MR SHOLTOS SUPPERHOUR IT
SEEMED TO ME THAT I COULD MANAGE THE THING EASILY THROUGH TONGA I
BROUGHT HIM OUT WITH ME WITH A LONG ROPE WOUND ROUND HIS WAIST HE
COULD CLIMB LIKE A CAT AND HE SOON MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE ROOF
BUT AS ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTO WAS STILL IN THE
ROOM TO HIS COST TONGA THOUGHT HE HAD DONE SOMETHING VERY CLEVER IN
KILLING HIM FOR WHEN I CAME UP BY THE ROPE I FOUND HIM STRUTTING
ABOUT AS PROUD AS A PEACOCK VERY MUCH SURPRISED WAS HE WHEN I MADE
AT HIM WITH THE ROPES END AND CURSED HIM FOR A LITTLE BLOODTHIRSTY
IMP I TOOK THE TREASUREBOX AND LET IT DOWN AND THEN SLID DOWN
MYSELF HAVING FIRST LEFT THE SIGN OF THE FOUR UPON THE TABLE TO
SHOW THAT THE JEWELS HAD COME BACK AT LAST TO THOSE WHO HAD MOST
RIGHT TO THEM TONGA THEN PULLED UP THE ROPE CLOSED THE WINDOW AND
MADE OFF THE WAY THAT HE HAD COME
I DONT KNOW THAT I HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO TELL YOU I HAD HEARD A
WATERMAN SPEAK OF THE SPEED OF SMITHS LAUNCH THE AURORA SO I
THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE A HANDY CRAFT FOR OUR ESCAPE I ENGAGED WITH OLD
SMITH AND WAS TO GIVE HIM A BIG SUM IF HE GOT US SAFE TO OUR SHIP
HE KNEW NO DOUBT THAT THERE WAS SOME SCREW LOOSE BUT HE WAS NOT IN
OUR SECRETS ALL THIS IS THE TRUTH AND IF I TELL IT TO YOU
GENTLEMEN IT IS NOT TO AMUSE YOUFOR YOU HAVE NOT DONE ME A VERY
GOOD TURNBUT IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE BEST DEFENCE I CAN MAKE
IS JUST TO HOLD BACK NOTHING BUT LET ALL THE WORLD KNOW HOW BADLY I
HAVE MYSELF BEEN SERVED BY MAJOR SHOLTO AND HOW INNOCENT I AM OF THE
DEATH OF HIS SON
A VERY REMARKABLE ACCOUNT SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES A FITTING WINDUP
TO AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING CASE THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL NEW TO ME
IN THE LATTER PART OF YOUR NARRATIVE EXCEPT THAT YOU BROUGHT YOUR
OWN ROPE THAT I DID NOT KNOW BY THE WAY I HAD HOPED THAT TONGA HAD
LOST ALL HIS DARTS YET HE MANAGED TO SHOOT ONE AT US IN THE BOAT
HE HAD LOST THEM ALL SIR EXCEPT THE ONE WHICH WAS IN HIS BLOWPIPE
AT THE TIME
AH OF COURSE SAID HOLMES I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT
IS THERE ANY OTHER POINT WHICH YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK ABOUT ASKED
THE CONVICT AFFABLY
I THINK NOT THANK YOU MY COMPANION ANSWERED
WELL HOLMES SAID ATHELNEY JONES YOU ARE A MAN TO BE HUMORED
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU ARE A CONNOISSEUR OF CRIME BUT DUTY IS
DUTY AND I HAVE GONE RATHER FAR IN DOING WHAT YOU AND YOUR FRIEND
ASKED ME I SHALL FEEL MORE AT EASE WHEN WE HAVE OUR STORYTELLER
HERE SAFE UNDER LOCK AND KEY THE CAB STILL WAITS AND THERE ARE TWO
INSPECTORS DOWNSTAIRS I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU BOTH FOR YOUR
ASSISTANCE OF COURSE YOU WILL BE WANTED AT THE TRIAL GOODNIGHT TO

GOODNIGHT GENTLEMEN BOTH SAID JONATHAN SMALL
YOU FIRST SMALL REMARKED THE WARY JONES AS THEY LEFT THE ROOM
ILL TAKE PARTICULAR CARE THAT YOU DONT CLUB ME WITH YOUR WOODEN
LEG WHATEVER YOU MAY HAVE DONE TO THE GENTLEMAN AT THE ANDAMAN
ISLES
WELL AND THERE IS THE END OF OUR LITTLE DRAMA I REMARKED AFTER
WE HAD SET SOME TIME SMOKING IN SILENCE I FEAR THAT IT MAY BE THE
LAST INVESTIGATION IN WHICH I SHALL HAVE THE CHANCE OF STUDYING YOUR
METHODS MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND
IN PROSPECTIVE
HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN I FEARED AS MUCH SAID HE I REALLY
CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU
I WAS A LITTLE HURT HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY
CHOICE I ASKED
NOT AT ALL I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I
EVER MET AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE
BEEN DOING SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY WITNESS THE WAY IN
WHICH SHE PRESERVED THAT AGRA PLAN FROM ALL THE OTHER PAPERS OF HER
FATHER BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS
OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS I
SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF LEST I BIAS MY JUDGMENT
I TRUST SAID I LAUGHING THAT MY JUDGMENT MAY SURVIVE THE
ORDEAL BUT YOU LOOK WEARY
YES THE REACTION IS ALREADY UPON ME I SHALL BE AS LIMP AS A RAG
FOR A WEEK
STRANGE SAID I HOW TERMS OF WHAT IN ANOTHER MAN I SHOULD CALL
LAZINESS ALTERNATE WITH YOUR FITS OF SPLENDID ENERGY AND VIGOR
YES HE ANSWERED THERE ARE IN ME THE MAKINGS OF A VERY FINE
LOAFER AND ALSO OF A PRETTY SPRY SORT OF FELLOW I OFTEN THINK OF
THOSE LINES OF OLD GOETHE
SCHADE DA DIE NATUR NUR EINEN MENSCH AUS DIR SCHUF
DENN ZUM WRDIGEN MANN WAR UND ZUM SCHELMEN DER STOFF
BY THE WAY A PROPOS OF THIS NORWOOD BUSINESS YOU SEE THAT THEY
HAD AS I SURMISED A CONFEDERATE IN THE HOUSE WHO COULD BE NONE
OTHER THAN LAL RAO THE BUTLER SO JONES ACTUALLY HAS THE UNDIVIDED
HONOR OF HAVING CAUGHT ONE FISH IN HIS GREAT HAUL
THE DIVISION SEEMS RATHER UNFAIR I REMARKED YOU HAVE DONE ALL
THE WORK IN THIS BUSINESS I GET A WIFE OUT OF IT JONES GETS THE
CREDIT PRAY WHAT REMAINS FOR YOU
FOR ME SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES THERE STILL REMAINS THE
COCAINEBOTTLE AND HE STRETCHED HIS LONG WHITE HAND UP FOR IT
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA
TABLE OF CONTENTS
CHAPTER CHAPTER CHAPTER CHAPTER I
TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM
MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND
PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY
EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ALL EMOTIONS AND THAT ONE
PARTICULARLY WERE ABHORRENT TO HIS COLD PRECISE BUT ADMIRABLY
BALANCED MIND HE WAS I TAKE IT THE MOST PERFECT REASONING AND
OBSERVING MACHINE THAT THE WORLD HAS SEEN BUT AS A LOVER HE WOULD
HAVE PLACED HIMSELF IN A FALSE POSITION HE NEVER SPOKE OF THE SOFTER
PASSIONS SAVE WITH A GIBE AND A SNEER THEY WERE ADMIRABLE THINGS
FOR THE OBSERVEREXCELLENT FOR DRAWING THE VEIL FROM MENS MOTIVES
AND ACTIONS BUT FOR THE TRAINED REASONER TO ADMIT SUCH INTRUSIONS
INTO HIS OWN DELICATE AND FINELY ADJUSTED TEMPERAMENT WAS TO
INTRODUCE A DISTRACTING FACTOR WHICH MIGHT THROW A DOUBT UPON ALL HIS
MENTAL RESULTS GRIT IN A SENSITIVE INSTRUMENT OR A CRACK IN ONE OF
HIS OWN HIGHPOWER LENSES WOULD NOT BE MORE DISTURBING THAN A STRONG
EMOTION IN A NATURE SUCH AS HIS AND YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO
HIM AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER OF DUBIOUS AND
QUESTIONABLE MEMORY
I HAD SEEN LITTLE OF HOLMES LATELY MY MARRIAGE HAD DRIFTED US AWAY
FROM EACH OTHER MY OWN COMPLETE HAPPINESS AND THE HOMECENTRED
INTERESTS WHICH RISE UP AROUND THE MAN WHO FIRST FINDS HIMSELF MASTER
OF HIS OWN ESTABLISHMENT WERE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB ALL MY ATTENTION
WHILE HOLMES WHO LOATHED EVERY FORM OF SOCIETY WITH HIS WHOLE
BOHEMIAN SOUL REMAINED IN OUR LODGINGS IN BAKER STREET BURIED AMONG
HIS OLD BOOKS AND ALTERNATING FROM WEEK TO WEEK BETWEEN COCAINE AND
AMBITION THE DROWSINESS OF THE DRUG AND THE FIERCE ENERGY OF HIS
OWN KEEN NATURE HE WAS STILL AS EVER DEEPLY ATTRACTED BY THE STUDY
OF CRIME AND OCCUPIED HIS IMMENSE FACULTIES AND EXTRAORDINARY POWERS
OF OBSERVATION IN FOLLOWING OUT THOSE CLUES AND CLEARING UP THOSE
MYSTERIES WHICH HAD BEEN ABANDONED AS HOPELESS BY THE OFFICIAL
POLICE FROM TIME TO TIME I HEARD SOME VAGUE ACCOUNT OF HIS DOINGS
OF HIS SUMMONS TO ODESSA IN THE CASE OF THE TREPOFF MURDER OF HIS
CLEARING UP OF THE SINGULAR TRAGEDY OF THE ATKINSON BROTHERS AT
TRINCOMALEE AND FINALLY OF THE MISSION WHICH HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED SO
DELICATELY AND SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE REIGNING FAMILY OF HOLLAND
BEYOND THESE SIGNS OF HIS ACTIVITY HOWEVER WHICH I MERELY SHARED
WITH ALL THE READERS OF THE DAILY PRESS I KNEW LITTLE OF MY FORMER
FRIEND AND COMPANION
ONE NIGHTIT WAS ON THE TWENTIETH OF MARCH I WAS RETURNING
FROM A JOURNEY TO A PATIENT FOR I HAD NOW RETURNED TO CIVIL
PRACTICE WHEN MY WAY LED ME THROUGH BAKER STREET AS I PASSED THE
WELLREMEMBERED DOOR WHICH MUST ALWAYS BE ASSOCIATED IN MY MIND WITH
MY WOOING AND WITH THE DARK INCIDENTS OF THE STUDY IN SCARLET I WAS
SEIZED WITH A KEEN DESIRE TO SEE HOLMES AGAIN AND TO KNOW HOW HE WAS
EMPLOYING HIS EXTRAORDINARY POWERS HIS ROOMS WERE BRILLIANTLY LIT
AND EVEN AS I LOOKED UP I SAW HIS TALL SPARE FIGURE PASS TWICE IN
A DARK SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE BLIND HE WAS PACING THE ROOM SWIFTLY
EAGERLY WITH HIS HEAD SUNK UPON HIS CHEST AND HIS HANDS CLASPED
BEHIND HIM TO ME WHO KNEW HIS EVERY MOOD AND HABIT HIS ATTITUDE
AND MANNER TOLD THEIR OWN STORY HE WAS AT WORK AGAIN HE HAD RISEN
OUT OF HIS DRUGCREATED DREAMS AND WAS HOT UPON THE SCENT OF SOME NEW
PROBLEM I RANG THE BELL AND WAS SHOWN UP TO THE CHAMBER WHICH HAD
FORMERLY BEEN IN PART MY OWN
HIS MANNER WAS NOT EFFUSIVE IT SELDOM WAS BUT HE WAS GLAD I THINK
TO SEE ME WITH HARDLY A WORD SPOKEN BUT WITH A KINDLY EYE HE WAVED
ME TO AN ARMCHAIR THREW ACROSS HIS CASE OF CIGARS AND INDICATED A
SPIRIT CASE AND A GASOGENE IN THE CORNER THEN HE STOOD BEFORE THE
FIRE AND LOOKED ME OVER IN HIS SINGULAR INTROSPECTIVE FASHION
WEDLOCK SUITS YOU HE REMARKED I THINK WATSON THAT YOU HAVE PUT
ON SEVEN AND A HALF POUNDS SINCE I SAW YOU
SEVEN I ANSWERED
INDEED I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT A LITTLE MORE JUST A TRIFLE MORE I
FANCY WATSON AND IN PRACTICE AGAIN I OBSERVE YOU DID NOT TELL ME
THAT YOU INTENDED TO GO INTO HARNESS
THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW
I SEE IT I DEDUCE IT HOW DO I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN GETTING
YOURSELF VERY WET LATELY AND THAT YOU HAVE A MOST CLUMSY AND
CARELESS SERVANT GIRL
MY DEAR HOLMES SAID I THIS IS TOO MUCH YOU WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE
BEEN BURNED HAD YOU LIVED A FEW CENTURIES AGO IT IS TRUE THAT I HAD
A COUNTRY WALK ON THURSDAY AND CAME HOME IN A DREADFUL MESS BUT AS I
HAVE CHANGED MY CLOTHES I CANT IMAGINE HOW YOU DEDUCE IT AS TO MARY
JANE SHE IS INCORRIGIBLE AND MY WIFE HAS GIVEN HER NOTICE BUT
THERE AGAIN I FAIL TO SEE HOW YOU WORK IT OUT
HE CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF AND RUBBED HIS LONG NERVOUS HANDS TOGETHER
IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF SAID HE MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE
INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT THE
LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE
BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE
EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT HENCE YOU
SEE MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER AND
THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOTSLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE
LONDON SLAVEY AS TO YOUR PRACTICE IF A GENTLEMAN WALKS INTO MY
ROOMS SMELLING OF IODOFORM WITH A BLACK MARK OF NITRATE OF SILVER
UPON HIS RIGHT FOREFINGER AND A BULGE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS
TOPHAT TO SHOW WHERE HE HAS SECRETED HIS STETHOSCOPE I MUST BE
DULL INDEED IF I DO NOT PRONOUNCE HIM TO BE AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE
MEDICAL PROFESSION
I COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THE EASE WITH WHICH HE EXPLAINED HIS
PROCESS OF DEDUCTION WHEN I HEAR YOU GIVE YOUR REASONS I
REMARKED THE THING ALWAYS APPEARS TO ME TO BE SO RIDICULOUSLY
SIMPLE THAT I COULD EASILY DO IT MYSELF THOUGH AT EACH SUCCESSIVE
INSTANCE OF YOUR REASONING I AM BAFFLED UNTIL YOU EXPLAIN YOUR
PROCESS AND YET I BELIEVE THAT MY EYES ARE AS GOOD AS YOURS
QUITE SO HE ANSWERED LIGHTING A CIGARETTE AND THROWING HIMSELF
DOWN INTO AN ARMCHAIR YOU SEE BUT YOU DO NOT OBSERVE THE
DISTINCTION IS CLEAR FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE FREQUENTLY SEEN THE STEPS
WHICH LEAD UP FROM THE HALL TO THIS ROOM
FREQUENTLY
HOW OFTEN
WELL SOME HUNDREDS OF TIMES

HOW MANY I DONT KNOW
QUITE SO YOU HAVE NOT OBSERVED AND YET YOU HAVE SEEN THAT IS JUST
MY POINT NOW I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVENTEEN STEPS BECAUSE I HAVE
BOTH SEEN AND OBSERVED BYTHEWAY SINCE YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THESE
LITTLE PROBLEMS AND SINCE YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO CHRONICLE ONE OR
TWO OF MY TRIFLING EXPERIENCES YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN THIS HE
THREW OVER A SHEET OF THICK PINKTINTED NOTEPAPER WHICH HAD BEEN
LYING OPEN UPON THE TABLE IT CAME BY THE LAST POST SAID HE READ

HAS DATA INSENSIBLY ONE BEGINS TO TWIST FACTS TO SUIT THEORIES
INSTEAD OF THEORIES TO SUIT FACTS BUT THE NOTE ITSELF WHAT DO YOU
DEDUCE FROM IT
I CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE WRITING AND THE PAPER UPON WHICH IT WAS
WRITTEN
THE MAN WHO WROTE IT WAS PRESUMABLY WELL TO DO I REMARKED
ENDEAVOURING TO IMITATE MY COMPANIONS PROCESSES SUCH PAPER COULD
NOT BE BOUGHT UNDER HALF A CROWN A PACKET IT IS PECULIARLY STRONG
AND STIFF
PECULIARTHAT IS THE VERY WORD SAID HOLMES IT IS NOT AN ENGLISH
PAPER AT ALL HOLD IT UP TO THE LIGHT
I DID SO AND SAW A LARGE E WITH A SMALL G A P AND A LARGE
G WITH A SMALL T WOVEN INTO THE TEXTURE OF THE PAPER
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT ASKED HOLMES
THE NAME OF THE MAKER NO DOUBT OR HIS MONOGRAM RATHER
NOT AT ALL THE G WITH THE SMALL T STANDS FOR GESELLSCHAFT
WHICH IS THE GERMAN FOR COMPANY IT IS A CUSTOMARY CONTRACTION LIKE
OUR CO P OF COURSE STANDS FOR PAPIER NOW FOR THE EG LET
US GLANCE AT OUR CONTINENTAL GAZETTEER HE TOOK DOWN A HEAVY BROWN
VOLUME FROM HIS SHELVES EGLOW EGLONITZHERE WE ARE EGRIA IT IS
IN A GERMANSPEAKING COUNTRYIN BOHEMIA NOT FAR FROM CARLSBAD
REMARKABLE AS BEING THE SCENE OF THE DEATH OF WALLENSTEIN AND FOR
ITS NUMEROUS GLASSFACTORIES AND PAPERMILLS HA HA MY BOY WHAT
DO YOU MAKE OF THAT HIS EYES SPARKLED AND HE SENT UP A GREAT BLUE
TRIUMPHANT CLOUD FROM HIS CIGARETTE
THE PAPER WAS MADE IN BOHEMIA I SAID
PRECISELY AND THE MAN WHO WROTE THE NOTE IS A GERMAN DO YOU NOTE
THE PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION OF THE SENTENCETHIS ACCOUNT OF YOU WE
HAVE FROM ALL QUARTERS RECEIVED A FRENCHMAN OR RUSSIAN COULD NOT
HAVE WRITTEN THAT IT IS THE GERMAN WHO IS SO UNCOURTEOUS TO HIS
VERBS IT ONLY REMAINS THEREFORE TO DISCOVER WHAT IS WANTED BY THIS
GERMAN WHO WRITES UPON BOHEMIAN PAPER AND PREFERS WEARING A MASK TO
SHOWING HIS FACE AND HERE HE COMES IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN TO RESOLVE
ALL OUR DOUBTS
AS HE SPOKE THERE WAS THE SHARP SOUND OF HORSES HOOFS AND GRATING
WHEELS AGAINST THE CURB FOLLOWED BY A SHARP PULL AT THE BELL HOLMES
WHISTLED
A PAIR BY THE SOUND SAID HE YES HE CONTINUED GLANCING OUT OF
THE WINDOW A NICE LITTLE BROUGHAM AND A PAIR OF BEAUTIES A HUNDRED
AND FIFTY GUINEAS APIECE THERES MONEY IN THIS CASE WATSON IF
THERE IS NOTHING ELSE
I THINK THAT I HAD BETTER GO HOLMES
NOT A BIT DOCTOR STAY WHERE YOU ARE I AM LOST WITHOUT MY BOSWELL
AND THIS PROMISES TO BE INTERESTING IT WOULD BE A PITY TO MISS IT
BUT YOUR CLIENT
NEVER MIND HIM I MAY WANT YOUR HELP AND SO MAY HE HERE HE COMES
SIT DOWN IN THAT ARMCHAIR DOCTOR AND GIVE US YOUR BEST ATTENTION
A SLOW AND HEAVY STEP WHICH HAD BEEN HEARD UPON THE STAIRS AND IN
THE PASSAGE PAUSED IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE DOOR THEN THERE WAS A
LOUD AND AUTHORITATIVE TAP
COME IN SAID HOLMES
A MAN ENTERED WHO COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN LESS THAN SIX FEET SIX
INCHES IN HEIGHT WITH THE CHEST AND LIMBS OF A HERCULES HIS DRESS
WAS RICH WITH A RICHNESS WHICH WOULD IN ENGLAND BE LOOKED UPON AS
AKIN TO BAD TASTE HEAVY BANDS OF ASTRAKHAN WERE SLASHED ACROSS THE
SLEEVES AND FRONTS OF HIS DOUBLEBREASTED COAT WHILE THE DEEP BLUE
CLOAK WHICH WAS THROWN OVER HIS SHOULDERS WAS LINED WITH
FLAMECOLOURED SILK AND SECURED AT THE NECK WITH A BROOCH WHICH
CONSISTED OF A SINGLE FLAMING BERYL BOOTS WHICH EXTENDED HALFWAY UP
HIS CALVES AND WHICH WERE TRIMMED AT THE TOPS WITH RICH BROWN FUR
COMPLETED THE IMPRESSION OF BARBARIC OPULENCE WHICH WAS SUGGESTED BY
HIS WHOLE APPEARANCE HE CARRIED A BROADBRIMMED HAT IN HIS HAND
WHILE HE WORE ACROSS THE UPPER PART OF HIS FACE EXTENDING DOWN PAST
THE CHEEKBONES A BLACK VIZARD MASK WHICH HE HAD APPARENTLY ADJUSTED
THAT VERY MOMENT FOR HIS HAND WAS STILL RAISED TO IT AS HE ENTERED
FROM THE LOWER PART OF THE FACE HE APPEARED TO BE A MAN OF STRONG
CHARACTER WITH A THICK HANGING LIP AND A LONG STRAIGHT CHIN
SUGGESTIVE OF RESOLUTION PUSHED TO THE LENGTH OF OBSTINACY
YOU HAD MY NOTE HE ASKED WITH A DEEP HARSH VOICE AND A STRONGLY
MARKED GERMAN ACCENT I TOLD YOU THAT I WOULD CALL HE LOOKED FROM
ONE TO THE OTHER OF US AS IF UNCERTAIN WHICH TO ADDRESS
PRAY TAKE A SEAT SAID HOLMES THIS IS MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE
DR WATSON WHO IS OCCASIONALLY GOOD ENOUGH TO HELP ME IN MY CASES
WHOM HAVE I THE HONOUR TO ADDRESS
YOU MAY ADDRESS ME AS THE COUNT VON KRAMM A BOHEMIAN NOBLEMAN I
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS GENTLEMAN YOUR FRIEND IS A MAN OF HONOUR AND
DISCRETION WHOM I MAY TRUST WITH A MATTER OF THE MOST EXTREME
IMPORTANCE IF NOT I SHOULD MUCH PREFER TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU
ALONE
I ROSE TO GO BUT HOLMES CAUGHT ME BY THE WRIST AND PUSHED ME BACK
INTO MY CHAIR IT IS BOTH OR NONE SAID HE YOU MAY SAY BEFORE
THIS GENTLEMAN ANYTHING WHICH YOU MAY SAY TO ME
THE COUNT SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS THEN I MUST BEGIN SAID HE
BY BINDING YOU BOTH TO ABSOLUTE SECRECY FOR TWO YEARS AT THE END OF
THAT TIME THE MATTER WILL BE OF NO IMPORTANCE AT PRESENT IT IS NOT
TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT IT IS OF SUCH WEIGHT IT MAY HAVE AN INFLUENCE
UPON EUROPEAN HISTORY
I PROMISE SAID HOLMES
AND I
YOU WILL EXCUSE THIS MASK CONTINUED OUR STRANGE VISITOR THE
AUGUST PERSON WHO EMPLOYS ME WISHES HIS AGENT TO BE UNKNOWN TO YOU
AND I MAY CONFESS AT ONCE THAT THE TITLE BY WHICH I HAVE JUST CALLED
MYSELF IS NOT EXACTLY MY OWN
I WAS AWARE OF IT SAID HOLMES DRYLY
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE OF GREAT DELICACY AND EVERY PRECAUTION HAS TO
BE TAKEN TO QUENCH WHAT MIGHT GROW TO BE AN IMMENSE SCANDAL AND
SERIOUSLY COMPROMISE ONE OF THE REIGNING FAMILIES OF EUROPE TO SPEAK
PLAINLY THE MATTER IMPLICATES THE GREAT HOUSE OF ORMSTEIN
HEREDITARY KINGS OF BOHEMIA
I WAS ALSO AWARE OF THAT MURMURED HOLMES SETTLING HIMSELF DOWN IN
HIS ARMCHAIR AND CLOSING HIS EYES
OUR VISITOR GLANCED WITH SOME APPARENT SURPRISE AT THE LANGUID
LOUNGING FIGURE OF THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN NO DOUBT DEPICTED TO HIM AS
THE MOST INCISIVE REASONER AND MOST ENERGETIC AGENT IN EUROPE HOLMES
SLOWLY REOPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED IMPATIENTLY AT HIS GIGANTIC
CLIENT
IF YOUR MAJESTY WOULD CONDESCEND TO STATE YOUR CASE HE REMARKED
I SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO ADVISE YOU
THE MAN SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN
UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THEN WITH A GESTURE OF DESPERATION HE
TORE THE MASK FROM HIS FACE AND HURLED IT UPON THE GROUND YOU ARE
RIGHT HE CRIED I AM THE KING WHY SHOULD I ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL
IT
WHY INDEED MURMURED HOLMES YOUR MAJESTY HAD NOT SPOKEN BEFORE I
WAS AWARE THAT I WAS ADDRESSING WILHELM GOTTSREICH SIGISMOND VON
ORMSTEIN GRAND DUKE OF CASSELFELSTEIN AND HEREDITARY KING OF
BOHEMIA
BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND SAID OUR STRANGE VISITOR SITTING DOWN ONCE
MORE AND PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS HIGH WHITE FOREHEAD YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND THAT I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DOING SUCH BUSINESS IN MY OWN
PERSON YET THE MATTER WAS SO DELICATE THAT I COULD NOT CONFIDE IT TO
AN AGENT WITHOUT PUTTING MYSELF IN HIS POWER I HAVE COME INCOGNITO
FROM PRAGUE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSULTING YOU
THEN PRAY CONSULT SAID HOLMES SHUTTING HIS EYES ONCE MORE
THE FACTS ARE BRIEFLY THESE SOME FIVE YEARS AGO DURING A LENGTHY
VISIT TO WARSAW I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE WELLKNOWN
ADVENTURESS IRENE ADLER THE NAME IS NO DOUBT FAMILIAR TO YOU
KINDLY LOOK HER UP IN MY INDEX DOCTOR MURMURED HOLMES WITHOUT
OPENING HIS EYES FOR MANY YEARS HE HAD ADOPTED A SYSTEM OF DOCKETING
ALL PARAGRAPHS CONCERNING MEN AND THINGS SO THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO
NAME A SUBJECT OR A PERSON ON WHICH HE COULD NOT AT ONCE FURNISH
INFORMATION IN THIS CASE I FOUND HER BIOGRAPHY SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN
THAT OF A HEBREW RABBI AND THAT OF A STAFFCOMMANDER WHO HAD WRITTEN
A MONOGRAPH UPON THE DEEPSEA FISHES
LET ME SEE SAID HOLMES HUM BORN IN NEW JERSEY IN THE YEAR CONTRALTOHUM
LA SCALA HUM PRIMA DONNA IMPERIAL OPERA OF
WARSAWYES RETIRED FROM OPERATIC STAGEHA LIVING IN LONDONQUITE
SO YOUR MAJESTY AS I UNDERSTAND BECAME ENTANGLED WITH THIS YOUNG
PERSON WROTE HER SOME COMPROMISING LETTERS AND IS NOW DESIROUS OF
GETTING THOSE LETTERS BACK
PRECISELY SO BUT HOW
WAS THERE A SECRET MARRIAGE
NONE
NO LEGAL PAPERS OR CERTIFICATES
NONE
THEN I FAIL TO FOLLOW YOUR MAJESTY IF THIS YOUNG PERSON SHOULD
PRODUCE HER LETTERS FOR BLACKMAILING OR OTHER PURPOSES HOW IS SHE TO
PROVE THEIR AUTHENTICITY
THERE IS THE WRITING
POOH POOH FORGERY
MY PRIVATE NOTEPAPER
STOLEN
MY OWN SEAL
IMITATED
MY PHOTOGRAPH
BOUGHT
WE WERE BOTH IN THE PHOTOGRAPH
OH DEAR THAT IS VERY BAD YOUR MAJESTY HAS INDEED COMMITTED AN
INDISCRETION
I WAS MADINSANE
YOU HAVE COMPROMISED YOURSELF SERIOUSLY
I WAS ONLY CROWN PRINCE THEN I WAS YOUNG I AM BUT THIRTY NOW
IT MUST BE RECOVERED
WE HAVE TRIED AND FAILED
YOUR MAJESTY MUST PAY IT MUST BE BOUGHT
SHE WILL NOT SELL
STOLEN THEN
FIVE ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TWICE BURGLARS IN MY PAY RANSACKED HER
HOUSE ONCE WE DIVERTED HER LUGGAGE WHEN SHE TRAVELLED TWICE SHE HAS
BEEN WAYLAID THERE HAS BEEN NO RESULT
NO SIGN OF IT
ABSOLUTELY NONE
HOLMES LAUGHED IT IS QUITE A PRETTY LITTLE PROBLEM SAID HE
BUT A VERY SERIOUS ONE TO ME RETURNED THE KING REPROACHFULLY
VERY INDEED AND WHAT DOES SHE PROPOSE TO DO WITH THE PHOTOGRAPH
TO RUIN ME
BUT HOW
I AM ABOUT TO BE MARRIED
SO I HAVE HEARD
TO CLOTILDE LOTHMAN VON SAXEMENINGEN SECOND DAUGHTER OF THE KING
OF SCANDINAVIA YOU MAY KNOW THE STRICT PRINCIPLES OF HER FAMILY SHE
IS HERSELF THE VERY SOUL OF DELICACY A SHADOW OF A DOUBT AS TO MY
CONDUCT WOULD BRING THE MATTER TO AN END
AND IRENE ADLER
THREATENS TO SEND THEM THE PHOTOGRAPH AND SHE WILL DO IT I KNOW
THAT SHE WILL DO IT YOU DO NOT KNOW HER BUT SHE HAS A SOUL OF
STEEL SHE HAS THE FACE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF WOMEN AND THE MIND
OF THE MOST RESOLUTE OF MEN RATHER THAN I SHOULD MARRY ANOTHER
WOMAN THERE ARE NO LENGTHS TO WHICH SHE WOULD NOT GONONE
YOU ARE SURE THAT SHE HAS NOT SENT IT YET
I AM SURE
AND WHY
BECAUSE SHE HAS SAID THAT SHE WOULD SEND IT ON THE DAY WHEN THE
BETROTHAL WAS PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED THAT WILL BE NEXT MONDAY
OH THEN WE HAVE THREE DAYS YET SAID HOLMES WITH A YAWN THAT IS
VERY FORTUNATE AS I HAVE ONE OR TWO MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE TO LOOK
INTO JUST AT PRESENT YOUR MAJESTY WILL OF COURSE STAY IN LONDON
FOR THE PRESENT
CERTAINLY YOU WILL FIND ME AT THE LANGHAM UNDER THE NAME OF THE
COUNT VON KRAMM
THEN I SHALL DROP YOU A LINE TO LET YOU KNOW HOW WE PROGRESS
PRAY DO SO I SHALL BE ALL ANXIETY
THEN AS TO MONEY
YOU HAVE CARTE BLANCHE
ABSOLUTELY
I TELL YOU THAT I WOULD GIVE ONE OF THE PROVINCES OF MY KINGDOM TO
HAVE THAT PHOTOGRAPH
AND FOR PRESENT EXPENSES
THE KING TOOK A HEAVY CHAMOIS LEATHER BAG FROM UNDER HIS CLOAK AND
LAID IT ON THE TABLE
THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED POUNDS IN GOLD AND SEVEN HUNDRED IN NOTES
HE SAID
HOLMES SCRIBBLED A RECEIPT UPON A SHEET OF HIS NOTEBOOK AND HANDED
IT TO HIM
AND MADEMOISELLES ADDRESS HE ASKED
IS BRIONY LODGE SERPENTINE AVENUE ST JOHNS WOOD
HOLMES TOOK A NOTE OF IT ONE OTHER QUESTION SAID HE WAS THE
PHOTOGRAPH A CABINET
IT WAS
THEN GOODNIGHT YOUR MAJESTY AND I TRUST THAT WE SHALL SOON HAVE
SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU AND GOODNIGHT WATSON HE ADDED AS THE
WHEELS OF THE ROYAL BROUGHAM ROLLED DOWN THE STREET IF YOU WILL BE
GOOD ENOUGH TO CALL TOMORROW AFTERNOON AT THREE OCLOCK I SHOULD
LIKE TO CHAT THIS LITTLE MATTER OVER WITH YOU
CHAPTER II
AT THREE OCLOCK PRECISELY I WAS AT BAKER STREET BUT HOLMES HAD NOT
YET RETURNED THE LANDLADY INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD LEFT THE HOUSE
SHORTLY AFTER EIGHT OCLOCK IN THE MORNING I SAT DOWN BESIDE THE
FIRE HOWEVER WITH THE INTENTION OF AWAITING HIM HOWEVER LONG HE
MIGHT BE I WAS ALREADY DEEPLY INTERESTED IN HIS INQUIRY FOR THOUGH
IT WAS SURROUNDED BY NONE OF THE GRIM AND STRANGE FEATURES WHICH WERE
ASSOCIATED WITH THE TWO CRIMES WHICH I HAVE ALREADY RECORDED STILL
THE NATURE OF THE CASE AND THE EXALTED STATION OF HIS CLIENT GAVE IT
A CHARACTER OF ITS OWN INDEED APART FROM THE NATURE OF THE
INVESTIGATION WHICH MY FRIEND HAD ON HAND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS
MASTERLY GRASP OF A SITUATION AND HIS KEEN INCISIVE REASONING
WHICH MADE IT A PLEASURE TO ME TO STUDY HIS SYSTEM OF WORK AND TO
FOLLOW THE QUICK SUBTLE METHODS BY WHICH HE DISENTANGLED THE MOST
INEXTRICABLE MYSTERIES SO ACCUSTOMED WAS I TO HIS INVARIABLE SUCCESS
THAT THE VERY POSSIBILITY OF HIS FAILING HAD CEASED TO ENTER INTO MY
HEAD
IT WAS CLOSE UPON FOUR BEFORE THE DOOR OPENED AND A DRUNKENLOOKING
GROOM ILLKEMPT AND SIDEWHISKERED WITH AN INFLAMED FACE AND
DISREPUTABLE CLOTHES WALKED INTO THE ROOM ACCUSTOMED AS I WAS TO MY
FRIENDS AMAZING POWERS IN THE USE OF DISGUISES I HAD TO LOOK THREE
TIMES BEFORE I WAS CERTAIN THAT IT WAS INDEED HE WITH A NOD HE
VANISHED INTO THE BEDROOM WHENCE HE EMERGED IN FIVE MINUTES
TWEEDSUITED AND RESPECTABLE AS OF OLD PUTTING HIS HANDS INTO HIS
POCKETS HE STRETCHED OUT HIS LEGS IN FRONT OF THE FIRE AND LAUGHED
HEARTILY FOR SOME MINUTES
WELL REALLY HE CRIED AND THEN HE CHOKED AND LAUGHED AGAIN UNTIL
HE WAS OBLIGED TO LIE BACK LIMP AND HELPLESS IN THE CHAIR
WHAT IS IT
ITS QUITE TOO FUNNY I AM SURE YOU COULD NEVER GUESS HOW I EMPLOYED
MY MORNING OR WHAT I ENDED BY DOING
I CANT IMAGINE I SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE HABITS
AND PERHAPS THE HOUSE OF MISS IRENE ADLER
QUITE SO BUT THE SEQUEL WAS RATHER UNUSUAL I WILL TELL YOU
HOWEVER I LEFT THE HOUSE A LITTLE AFTER EIGHT OCLOCK THIS MORNING
IN THE CHARACTER OF A GROOM OUT OF WORK THERE IS A WONDERFUL
SYMPATHY AND FREEMASONRY AMONG HORSEY MEN BE ONE OF THEM AND YOU
WILL KNOW ALL THAT THERE IS TO KNOW I SOON FOUND BRIONY LODGE IT IS
A BIJOU VILLA WITH A GARDEN AT THE BACK BUT BUILT OUT IN FRONT
RIGHT UP TO THE ROAD TWO STORIES CHUBB LOCK TO THE DOOR LARGE
SITTINGROOM ON THE RIGHT SIDE WELL FURNISHED WITH LONG WINDOWS
ALMOST TO THE FLOOR AND THOSE PREPOSTEROUS ENGLISH WINDOW FASTENERS
WHICH A CHILD COULD OPEN BEHIND THERE WAS NOTHING REMARKABLE SAVE
THAT THE PASSAGE WINDOW COULD BE REACHED FROM THE TOP OF THE
COACHHOUSE I WALKED ROUND IT AND EXAMINED IT CLOSELY FROM EVERY
POINT OF VIEW BUT WITHOUT NOTING ANYTHING ELSE OF INTEREST
I THEN LOUNGED DOWN THE STREET AND FOUND AS I EXPECTED THAT THERE
WAS A MEWS IN A LANE WHICH RUNS DOWN BY ONE WALL OF THE GARDEN I
LENT THE OSTLERS A HAND IN RUBBING DOWN THEIR HORSES AND RECEIVED IN
EXCHANGE TWOPENCE A GLASS OF HALF AND HALF TWO FILLS OF SHAG
TOBACCO AND AS MUCH INFORMATION AS I COULD DESIRE ABOUT MISS ADLER
TO SAY NOTHING OF HALF A DOZEN OTHER PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IN
WHOM I WAS NOT IN THE LEAST INTERESTED BUT WHOSE BIOGRAPHIES I WAS
COMPELLED TO LISTEN TO
AND WHAT OF IRENE ADLER I ASKED
OH SHE HAS TURNED ALL THE MENS HEADS DOWN IN THAT PART SHE IS THE
DAINTIEST THING UNDER A BONNET ON THIS PLANET SO SAY THE
SERPENTINEMEWS TO A MAN SHE LIVES QUIETLY SINGS AT CONCERTS
DRIVES OUT AT FIVE EVERY DAY AND RETURNS AT SEVEN SHARP FOR DINNER
SELDOM GOES OUT AT OTHER TIMES EXCEPT WHEN SHE SINGS HAS ONLY ONE
MALE VISITOR BUT A GOOD DEAL OF HIM HE IS DARK HANDSOME AND
DASHING NEVER CALLS LESS THAN ONCE A DAY AND OFTEN TWICE HE IS A
MR GODFREY NORTON OF THE INNER TEMPLE SEE THE ADVANTAGES OF A
CABMAN AS A CONFIDANT THEY HAD DRIVEN HIM HOME A DOZEN TIMES FROM
SERPENTINEMEWS AND KNEW ALL ABOUT HIM WHEN I HAD LISTENED TO ALL
THEY HAD TO TELL I BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN NEAR BRIONY LODGE ONCE
MORE AND TO THINK OVER MY PLAN OF CAMPAIGN
THIS GODFREY NORTON WAS EVIDENTLY AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE MATTER
HE WAS A LAWYER THAT SOUNDED OMINOUS WHAT WAS THE RELATION BETWEEN
THEM AND WHAT THE OBJECT OF HIS REPEATED VISITS WAS SHE HIS CLIENT
HIS FRIEND OR HIS MISTRESS IF THE FORMER SHE HAD PROBABLY
TRANSFERRED THE PHOTOGRAPH TO HIS KEEPING IF THE LATTER IT WAS LESS
LIKELY ON THE ISSUE OF THIS QUESTION DEPENDED WHETHER I SHOULD
CONTINUE MY WORK AT BRIONY LODGE OR TURN MY ATTENTION TO THE
GENTLEMANS CHAMBERS IN THE TEMPLE IT WAS A DELICATE POINT AND IT
WIDENED THE FIELD OF MY INQUIRY I FEAR THAT I BORE YOU WITH THESE
DETAILS BUT I HAVE TO LET YOU SEE MY LITTLE DIFFICULTIES IF YOU ARE
TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION
I AM FOLLOWING YOU CLOSELY I ANSWERED
I WAS STILL BALANCING THE MATTER IN MY MIND WHEN A HANSOM CAB DROVE
UP TO BRIONY LODGE AND A GENTLEMAN SPRANG OUT HE WAS A REMARKABLY
HANDSOME MAN DARK AQUILINE AND MOUSTACHEDEVIDENTLY THE MAN OF
WHOM I HAD HEARD HE APPEARED TO BE IN A GREAT HURRY SHOUTED TO THE
CABMAN TO WAIT AND BRUSHED PAST THE MAID WHO OPENED THE DOOR WITH
THE AIR OF A MAN WHO WAS THOROUGHLY AT HOME
HE WAS IN THE HOUSE ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AND I COULD CATCH GLIMPSES
OF HIM IN THE WINDOWS OF THE SITTINGROOM PACING UP AND DOWN
TALKING EXCITEDLY AND WAVING HIS ARMS OF HER I COULD SEE NOTHING
PRESENTLY HE EMERGED LOOKING EVEN MORE FLURRIED THAN BEFORE AS HE
STEPPED UP TO THE CAB HE PULLED A GOLD WATCH FROM HIS POCKET AND
LOOKED AT IT EARNESTLY DRIVE LIKE THE DEVIL HE SHOUTED FIRST TO
GROSS HANKEYS IN REGENT STREET AND THEN TO THE CHURCH OF ST
MONICA IN THE EDGEWARE ROAD HALF A GUINEA IF YOU DO IT IN TWENTY
MINUTES
AWAY THEY WENT AND I WAS JUST WONDERING WHETHER I SHOULD NOT DO
WELL TO FOLLOW THEM WHEN UP THE LANE CAME A NEAT LITTLE LANDAU THE
COACHMAN WITH HIS COAT ONLY HALFBUTTONED AND HIS TIE UNDER HIS EAR
WHILE ALL THE TAGS OF HIS HARNESS WERE STICKING OUT OF THE BUCKLES
IT HADNT PULLED UP BEFORE SHE SHOT OUT OF THE HALL DOOR AND INTO IT
I ONLY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HER AT THE MOMENT BUT SHE WAS A LOVELY
WOMAN WITH A FACE THAT A MAN MIGHT DIE FOR
THE CHURCH OF ST MONICA JOHN SHE CRIED AND HALF A SOVEREIGN
IF YOU REACH IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
THIS WAS QUITE TOO GOOD TO LOSE WATSON I WAS JUST BALANCING
WHETHER I SHOULD RUN FOR IT OR WHETHER I SHOULD PERCH BEHIND HER
LANDAU WHEN A CAB CAME THROUGH THE STREET THE DRIVER LOOKED TWICE AT
SUCH A SHABBY FARE BUT I JUMPED IN BEFORE HE COULD OBJECT THE
CHURCH OF ST MONICA SAID I AND HALF A SOVEREIGN IF YOU REACH IT
IN TWENTY MINUTES IT WAS TWENTYFIVE MINUTES TO TWELVE AND OF
COURSE IT WAS CLEAR ENOUGH WHAT WAS IN THE WIND
MY CABBY DROVE FAST I DONT THINK I EVER DROVE FASTER BUT THE
OTHERS WERE THERE BEFORE US THE CAB AND THE LANDAU WITH THEIR
STEAMING HORSES WERE IN FRONT OF THE DOOR WHEN I ARRIVED I PAID THE
MAN AND HURRIED INTO THE CHURCH THERE WAS NOT A SOUL THERE SAVE THE
TWO WHOM I HAD FOLLOWED AND A SURPLICED CLERGYMAN WHO SEEMED TO BE
EXPOSTULATING WITH THEM THEY WERE ALL THREE STANDING IN A KNOT IN
FRONT OF THE ALTAR I LOUNGED UP THE SIDE AISLE LIKE ANY OTHER IDLER
WHO HAS DROPPED INTO A CHURCH SUDDENLY TO MY SURPRISE THE THREE AT
THE ALTAR FACED ROUND TO ME AND GODFREY NORTON CAME RUNNING AS HARD
AS HE COULD TOWARDS ME
THANK GOD HE CRIED YOULL DO COME COME
WHAT THEN I ASKED
COME MAN COME ONLY THREE MINUTES OR IT WONT BE LEGAL
I WAS HALFDRAGGED UP TO THE ALTAR AND BEFORE I KNEW WHERE I WAS I
FOUND MYSELF MUMBLING RESPONSES WHICH WERE WHISPERED IN MY EAR AND
VOUCHING FOR THINGS OF WHICH I KNEW NOTHING AND GENERALLY ASSISTING
IN THE SECURE TYING UP OF IRENE ADLER SPINSTER TO GODFREY NORTON
BACHELOR IT WAS ALL DONE IN AN INSTANT AND THERE WAS THE GENTLEMAN
THANKING ME ON THE ONE SIDE AND THE LADY ON THE OTHER WHILE THE
CLERGYMAN BEAMED ON ME IN FRONT IT WAS THE MOST PREPOSTEROUS
POSITION IN WHICH I EVER FOUND MYSELF IN MY LIFE AND IT WAS THE
THOUGHT OF IT THAT STARTED ME LAUGHING JUST NOW IT SEEMS THAT THERE
HAD BEEN SOME INFORMALITY ABOUT THEIR LICENSE THAT THE CLERGYMAN
ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO MARRY THEM WITHOUT A WITNESS OF SOME SORT AND
THAT MY LUCKY APPEARANCE SAVED THE BRIDEGROOM FROM HAVING TO SALLY
OUT INTO THE STREETS IN SEARCH OF A BEST MAN THE BRIDE GAVE ME A
SOVEREIGN AND I MEAN TO WEAR IT ON MY WATCHCHAIN IN MEMORY OF THE
OCCASION
THIS IS A VERY UNEXPECTED TURN OF AFFAIRS SAID I AND WHAT THEN
WELL I FOUND MY PLANS VERY SERIOUSLY MENACED IT LOOKED AS IF THE
PAIR MIGHT TAKE AN IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE AND SO NECESSITATE VERY
PROMPT AND ENERGETIC MEASURES ON MY PART AT THE CHURCH DOOR
HOWEVER THEY SEPARATED HE DRIVING BACK TO THE TEMPLE AND SHE TO
HER OWN HOUSE I SHALL DRIVE OUT IN THE PARK AT FIVE AS USUAL SHE
SAID AS SHE LEFT HIM I HEARD NO MORE THEY DROVE AWAY IN DIFFERENT
DIRECTIONS AND I WENT OFF TO MAKE MY OWN ARRANGEMENTS
WHICH ARE
SOME COLD BEEF AND A GLASS OF BEER HE ANSWERED RINGING THE BELL
I HAVE BEEN TOO BUSY TO THINK OF FOOD AND I AM LIKELY TO BE BUSIER
STILL THIS EVENING BY THE WAY DOCTOR I SHALL WANT YOUR
COOPERATION
I SHALL BE DELIGHTED
YOU DONT MIND BREAKING THE LAW
NOT IN THE LEAST
NOR RUNNING A CHANCE OF ARREST
NOT IN A GOOD CAUSE
OH THE CAUSE IS EXCELLENT
THEN I AM YOUR MAN
I WAS SURE THAT I MIGHT RELY ON YOU
BUT WHAT IS IT YOU WISH
WHEN MRS TURNER HAS BROUGHT IN THE TRAY I WILL MAKE IT CLEAR TO
YOU NOW HE SAID AS HE TURNED HUNGRILY ON THE SIMPLE FARE THAT OUR
LANDLADY HAD PROVIDED I MUST DISCUSS IT WHILE I EAT FOR I HAVE NOT
MUCH TIME IT IS NEARLY FIVE NOW IN TWO HOURS WE MUST BE ON THE
SCENE OF ACTION MISS IRENE OR MADAME RATHER RETURNS FROM HER
DRIVE AT SEVEN WE MUST BE AT BRIONY LODGE TO MEET HER
AND WHAT THEN
YOU MUST LEAVE THAT TO ME I HAVE ALREADY ARRANGED WHAT IS TO OCCUR
THERE IS ONLY ONE POINT ON WHICH I MUST INSIST YOU MUST NOT
INTERFERE COME WHAT MAY YOU UNDERSTAND
I AM TO BE NEUTRAL
TO DO NOTHING WHATEVER THERE WILL PROBABLY BE SOME SMALL
UNPLEASANTNESS DO NOT JOIN IN IT IT WILL END IN MY BEING CONVEYED
INTO THE HOUSE FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS THE SITTINGROOM
WINDOW WILL OPEN YOU ARE TO STATION YOURSELF CLOSE TO THAT OPEN
WINDOW
YES
YOU ARE TO WATCH ME FOR I WILL BE VISIBLE TO YOU
YES
AND WHEN I RAISE MY HANDSOYOU WILL THROW INTO THE ROOM WHAT I
GIVE YOU TO THROW AND WILL AT THE SAME TIME RAISE THE CRY OF FIRE
YOU QUITE FOLLOW ME
ENTIRELY
IT IS NOTHING VERY FORMIDABLE HE SAID TAKING A LONG CIGARSHAPED
ROLL FROM HIS POCKET IT IS AN ORDINARY PLUMBERS SMOKEROCKET
FITTED WITH A CAP AT EITHER END TO MAKE IT SELFLIGHTING YOUR TASK
IS CONFINED TO THAT WHEN YOU RAISE YOUR CRY OF FIRE IT WILL BE
TAKEN UP BY QUITE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE YOU MAY THEN WALK TO THE END OF
THE STREET AND I WILL REJOIN YOU IN TEN MINUTES I HOPE THAT I HAVE
MADE MYSELF CLEAR
I AM TO REMAIN NEUTRAL TO GET NEAR THE WINDOW TO WATCH YOU AND AT
THE SIGNAL TO THROW IN THIS OBJECT THEN TO RAISE THE CRY OF FIRE
AND TO WAIT YOU AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET
PRECISELY
THEN YOU MAY ENTIRELY RELY ON ME
THAT IS EXCELLENT I THINK PERHAPS IT IS ALMOST TIME THAT I
PREPARE FOR THE NEW ROLE I HAVE TO PLAY
HE DISAPPEARED INTO HIS BEDROOM AND RETURNED IN A FEW MINUTES IN THE
CHARACTER OF AN AMIABLE AND SIMPLEMINDED NONCONFORMIST CLERGYMAN
HIS BROAD BLACK HAT HIS BAGGY TROUSERS HIS WHITE TIE HIS
SYMPATHETIC SMILE AND GENERAL LOOK OF PEERING AND BENEVOLENT
CURIOSITY WERE SUCH AS MR JOHN HARE ALONE COULD HAVE EQUALLED IT
WAS NOT MERELY THAT HOLMES CHANGED HIS COSTUME HIS EXPRESSION HIS
MANNER HIS VERY SOUL SEEMED TO VARY WITH EVERY FRESH PART THAT HE
ASSUMED THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR EVEN AS SCIENCE LOST AN ACUTE
REASONER WHEN HE BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME
IT WAS A QUARTER PAST SIX WHEN WE LEFT BAKER STREET AND IT STILL
WANTED TEN MINUTES TO THE HOUR WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES IN SERPENTINE
AVENUE IT WAS ALREADY DUSK AND THE LAMPS WERE JUST BEING LIGHTED AS
WE PACED UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF BRIONY LODGE WAITING FOR THE COMING
OF ITS OCCUPANT THE HOUSE WAS JUST SUCH AS I HAD PICTURED IT FROM
SHERLOCK HOLMES SUCCINCT DESCRIPTION BUT THE LOCALITY APPEARED TO
BE LESS PRIVATE THAN I EXPECTED ON THE CONTRARY FOR A SMALL STREET
IN A QUIET NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WAS REMARKABLY ANIMATED THERE WAS A
GROUP OF SHABBILY DRESSED MEN SMOKING AND LAUGHING IN A CORNER A
SCISSORSGRINDER WITH HIS WHEEL TWO GUARDSMEN WHO WERE FLIRTING WITH
A NURSEGIRL AND SEVERAL WELLDRESSED YOUNG MEN WHO WERE LOUNGING UP
AND DOWN WITH CIGARS IN THEIR MOUTHS
YOU SEE REMARKED HOLMES AS WE PACED TO AND FRO IN FRONT OF THE
HOUSE THIS MARRIAGE RATHER SIMPLIFIES MATTERS THE PHOTOGRAPH
BECOMES A DOUBLEEDGED WEAPON NOW THE CHANCES ARE THAT SHE WOULD BE
AS AVERSE TO ITS BEING SEEN BY MR GODFREY NORTON AS OUR CLIENT IS
TO ITS COMING TO THE EYES OF HIS PRINCESS NOW THE QUESTION ISWHERE
ARE WE TO FIND THE PHOTOGRAPH
WHERE INDEED
IT IS MOST UNLIKELY THAT SHE CARRIES IT ABOUT WITH HER IT IS
CABINET SIZE TOO LARGE FOR EASY CONCEALMENT ABOUT A WOMANS DRESS
SHE KNOWS THAT THE KING IS CAPABLE OF HAVING HER WAYLAID AND
SEARCHED TWO ATTEMPTS OF THE SORT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE WE MAY
TAKE IT THEN THAT SHE DOES NOT CARRY IT ABOUT WITH HER
WHERE THEN
HER BANKER OR HER LAWYER THERE IS THAT DOUBLE POSSIBILITY BUT I AM
INCLINED TO THINK NEITHER WOMEN ARE NATURALLY SECRETIVE AND THEY
LIKE TO DO THEIR OWN SECRETING WHY SHOULD SHE HAND IT OVER TO ANYONE
ELSE SHE COULD TRUST HER OWN GUARDIANSHIP BUT SHE COULD NOT TELL
WHAT INDIRECT OR POLITICAL INFLUENCE MIGHT BE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON A
BUSINESS MAN BESIDES REMEMBER THAT SHE HAD RESOLVED TO USE IT
WITHIN A FEW DAYS IT MUST BE WHERE SHE CAN LAY HER HANDS UPON IT IT
MUST BE IN HER OWN HOUSE
BUT IT HAS TWICE BEEN BURGLED
PSHAW THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO LOOK
BUT HOW WILL YOU LOOK
I WILL NOT LOOK
WHAT THEN
I WILL GET HER TO SHOW ME
BUT SHE WILL REFUSE
SHE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BUT I HEAR THE RUMBLE OF WHEELS IT IS HER
CARRIAGE NOW CARRY OUT MY ORDERS TO THE LETTER
AS HE SPOKE THE GLEAM OF THE SIDELIGHTS OF A CARRIAGE CAME ROUND THE
CURVE OF THE AVENUE IT WAS A SMART LITTLE LANDAU WHICH RATTLED UP TO
THE DOOR OF BRIONY LODGE AS IT PULLED UP ONE OF THE LOAFING MEN AT
THE CORNER DASHED FORWARD TO OPEN THE DOOR IN THE HOPE OF EARNING A
COPPER BUT WAS ELBOWED AWAY BY ANOTHER LOAFER WHO HAD RUSHED UP
WITH THE SAME INTENTION A FIERCE QUARREL BROKE OUT WHICH WAS
INCREASED BY THE TWO GUARDSMEN WHO TOOK SIDES WITH ONE OF THE
LOUNGERS AND BY THE SCISSORSGRINDER WHO WAS EQUALLY HOT UPON THE
OTHER SIDE A BLOW WAS STRUCK AND IN AN INSTANT THE LADY WHO HAD
STEPPED FROM HER CARRIAGE WAS THE CENTRE OF A LITTLE KNOT OF FLUSHED
AND STRUGGLING MEN WHO STRUCK SAVAGELY AT EACH OTHER WITH THEIR
FISTS AND STICKS HOLMES DASHED INTO THE CROWD TO PROTECT THE LADY
BUT JUST AS HE REACHED HER HE GAVE A CRY AND DROPPED TO THE GROUND
WITH THE BLOOD RUNNING FREELY DOWN HIS FACE AT HIS FALL THE
GUARDSMEN TOOK TO THEIR HEELS IN ONE DIRECTION AND THE LOUNGERS IN
THE OTHER WHILE A NUMBER OF BETTERDRESSED PEOPLE WHO HAD WATCHED
THE SCUFFLE WITHOUT TAKING PART IN IT CROWDED IN TO HELP THE LADY
AND TO ATTEND TO THE INJURED MAN IRENE ADLER AS I WILL STILL CALL
HER HAD HURRIED UP THE STEPS BUT SHE STOOD AT THE TOP WITH HER
SUPERB FIGURE OUTLINED AGAINST THE LIGHTS OF THE HALL LOOKING BACK
INTO THE STREET
IS THE POOR GENTLEMAN MUCH HURT SHE ASKED
HE IS DEAD CRIED SEVERAL VOICES
NO NO THERES LIFE IN HIM SHOUTED ANOTHER BUT HELL BE GONE
BEFORE YOU CAN GET HIM TO HOSPITAL
HES A BRAVE FELLOW SAID A WOMAN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THE LADYS
PURSE AND WATCH IF IT HADNT BEEN FOR HIM THEY WERE A GANG AND A
ROUGH ONE TOO AH HES BREATHING NOW
HE CANT LIE IN THE STREET MAY WE BRING HIM IN MARM
SURELY BRING HIM INTO THE SITTINGROOM THERE IS A COMFORTABLE
SOFA THIS WAY PLEASE
SLOWLY AND SOLEMNLY HE WAS BORNE INTO BRIONY LODGE AND LAID OUT IN
THE PRINCIPAL ROOM WHILE I STILL OBSERVED THE PROCEEDINGS FROM MY
POST BY THE WINDOW THE LAMPS HAD BEEN LIT BUT THE BLINDS HAD NOT
BEEN DRAWN SO THAT I COULD SEE HOLMES AS HE LAY UPON THE COUCH I DO
NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WAS SEIZED WITH COMPUNCTION AT THAT MOMENT FOR
THE PART HE WAS PLAYING BUT I KNOW THAT I NEVER FELT MORE HEARTILY
ASHAMED OF MYSELF IN MY LIFE THAN WHEN I SAW THE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE
AGAINST WHOM I WAS CONSPIRING OR THE GRACE AND KINDLINESS WITH WHICH
SHE WAITED UPON THE INJURED MAN AND YET IT WOULD BE THE BLACKEST
TREACHERY TO HOLMES TO DRAW BACK NOW FROM THE PART WHICH HE HAD
INTRUSTED TO ME I HARDENED MY HEART AND TOOK THE SMOKEROCKET FROM
UNDER MY ULSTER AFTER ALL I THOUGHT WE ARE NOT INJURING HER WE
ARE BUT PREVENTING HER FROM INJURING ANOTHER
HOLMES HAD SAT UP UPON THE COUCH AND I SAW HIM MOTION LIKE A MAN WHO
IS IN NEED OF AIR A MAID RUSHED ACROSS AND THREW OPEN THE WINDOW AT
THE SAME INSTANT I SAW HIM RAISE HIS HAND AND AT THE SIGNAL I TOSSED
MY ROCKET INTO THE ROOM WITH A CRY OF FIRE THE WORD WAS NO SOONER
OUT OF MY MOUTH THAN THE WHOLE CROWD OF SPECTATORS WELL DRESSED AND
ILLGENTLEMEN OSTLERS AND SERVANTMAIDSJOINED IN A GENERAL
SHRIEK OF FIRE THICK CLOUDS OF SMOKE CURLED THROUGH THE ROOM AND
OUT AT THE OPEN WINDOW I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF RUSHING FIGURES AND A
MOMENT LATER THE VOICE OF HOLMES FROM WITHIN ASSURING THEM THAT IT
WAS A FALSE ALARM SLIPPING THROUGH THE SHOUTING CROWD I MADE MY WAY
TO THE CORNER OF THE STREET AND IN TEN MINUTES WAS REJOICED TO FIND
MY FRIENDS ARM IN MINE AND TO GET AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF UPROAR HE
WALKED SWIFTLY AND IN SILENCE FOR SOME FEW MINUTES UNTIL WE HAD
TURNED DOWN ONE OF THE QUIET STREETS WHICH LEAD TOWARDS THE EDGEWARE
ROAD
YOU DID IT VERY NICELY DOCTOR HE REMARKED NOTHING COULD HAVE
BEEN BETTER IT IS ALL RIGHT
YOU HAVE THE PHOTOGRAPH
I KNOW WHERE IT IS
AND HOW DID YOU FIND OUT
SHE SHOWED ME AS I TOLD YOU SHE WOULD
I AM STILL IN THE DARK
I DO NOT WISH TO MAKE A MYSTERY SAID HE LAUGHING THE MATTER WAS
PERFECTLY SIMPLE YOU OF COURSE SAW THAT EVERYONE IN THE STREET WAS
AN ACCOMPLICE THEY WERE ALL ENGAGED FOR THE EVENING
I GUESSED AS MUCH
THEN WHEN THE ROW BROKE OUT I HAD A LITTLE MOIST RED PAINT IN THE
PALM OF MY HAND I RUSHED FORWARD FELL DOWN CLAPPED MY HAND TO MY
FACE AND BECAME A PITEOUS SPECTACLE IT IS AN OLD TRICK
THAT ALSO I COULD FATHOM
THEN THEY CARRIED ME IN SHE WAS BOUND TO HAVE ME IN WHAT ELSE
COULD SHE DO AND INTO HER SITTINGROOM WHICH WAS THE VERY ROOM
WHICH I SUSPECTED IT LAY BETWEEN THAT AND HER BEDROOM AND I WAS
DETERMINED TO SEE WHICH THEY LAID ME ON A COUCH I MOTIONED FOR AIR
THEY WERE COMPELLED TO OPEN THE WINDOW AND YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE
HOW DID THAT HELP YOU
IT WAS ALLIMPORTANT WHEN A WOMAN THINKS THAT HER HOUSE IS ON FIRE
HER INSTINCT IS AT ONCE TO RUSH TO THE THING WHICH SHE VALUES MOST
IT IS A PERFECTLY OVERPOWERING IMPULSE AND I HAVE MORE THAN ONCE
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IT IN THE CASE OF THE DARLINGTON SUBSTITUTION
SCANDAL IT WAS OF USE TO ME AND ALSO IN THE ARNSWORTH CASTLE
BUSINESS A MARRIED WOMAN GRABS AT HER BABY AN UNMARRIED ONE REACHES
FOR HER JEWELBOX NOW IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT OUR LADY OF TODAY HAD
NOTHING IN THE HOUSE MORE PRECIOUS TO HER THAN WHAT WE ARE IN QUEST
OF SHE WOULD RUSH TO SECURE IT THE ALARM OF FIRE WAS ADMIRABLY
DONE THE SMOKE AND SHOUTING WERE ENOUGH TO SHAKE NERVES OF STEEL
SHE RESPONDED BEAUTIFULLY THE PHOTOGRAPH IS IN A RECESS BEHIND A
SLIDING PANEL JUST ABOVE THE RIGHT BELLPULL SHE WAS THERE IN AN
INSTANT AND I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF IT AS SHE HALFDREW IT OUT WHEN I
CRIED OUT THAT IT WAS A FALSE ALARM SHE REPLACED IT GLANCED AT THE
ROCKET RUSHED FROM THE ROOM AND I HAVE NOT SEEN HER SINCE I ROSE
AND MAKING MY EXCUSES ESCAPED FROM THE HOUSE I HESITATED WHETHER
TO ATTEMPT TO SECURE THE PHOTOGRAPH AT ONCE BUT THE COACHMAN HAD
COME IN AND AS HE WAS WATCHING ME NARROWLY IT SEEMED SAFER TO WAIT
A LITTLE OVERPRECIPITANCE MAY RUIN ALL
AND NOW I ASKED
OUR QUEST IS PRACTICALLY FINISHED I SHALL CALL WITH THE KING
TOMORROW AND WITH YOU IF YOU CARE TO COME WITH US WE WILL BE
SHOWN INTO THE SITTINGROOM TO WAIT FOR THE LADY BUT IT IS PROBABLE
THAT WHEN SHE COMES SHE MAY FIND NEITHER US NOR THE PHOTOGRAPH IT
MIGHT BE A SATISFACTION TO HIS MAJESTY TO REGAIN IT WITH HIS OWN
HANDS
AND WHEN WILL YOU CALL
AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING SHE WILL NOT BE UP SO THAT WE SHALL HAVE A
CLEAR FIELD BESIDES WE MUST BE PROMPT FOR THIS MARRIAGE MAY MEAN A
COMPLETE CHANGE IN HER LIFE AND HABITS I MUST WIRE TO THE KING
WITHOUT DELAY
WE HAD REACHED BAKER STREET AND HAD STOPPED AT THE DOOR HE WAS
SEARCHING HIS POCKETS FOR THE KEY WHEN SOMEONE PASSING SAID
GOODNIGHT MISTER SHERLOCK HOLMES
THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE ON THE PAVEMENT AT THE TIME BUT THE
GREETING APPEARED TO COME FROM A SLIM YOUTH IN AN ULSTER WHO HAD
HURRIED BY
IVE HEARD THAT VOICE BEFORE SAID HOLMES STARING DOWN THE DIMLY
LIT STREET NOW I WONDER WHO THE DEUCE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
CHAPTER III
I SLEPT AT BAKER STREET THAT NIGHT AND WE WERE ENGAGED UPON OUR
TOAST AND COFFEE IN THE MORNING WHEN THE KING OF BOHEMIA RUSHED INTO
THE ROOM
YOU HAVE REALLY GOT IT HE CRIED GRASPING SHERLOCK HOLMES BY
EITHER SHOULDER AND LOOKING EAGERLY INTO HIS FACE
NOT YET
BUT YOU HAVE HOPES
I HAVE HOPES
THEN COME I AM ALL IMPATIENCE TO BE GONE
WE MUST HAVE A CAB
NO MY BROUGHAM IS WAITING
THEN THAT WILL SIMPLIFY MATTERS WE DESCENDED AND STARTED OFF ONCE
MORE FOR BRIONY LODGE
IRENE ADLER IS MARRIED REMARKED HOLMES
MARRIED WHEN
YESTERDAY
BUT TO WHOM
TO AN ENGLISH LAWYER NAMED NORTON
BUT SHE COULD NOT LOVE HIM
I AM IN HOPES THAT SHE DOES
AND WHY IN HOPES
BECAUSE IT WOULD SPARE YOUR MAJESTY ALL FEAR OF FUTURE ANNOYANCE IF
THE LADY LOVES HER HUSBAND SHE DOES NOT LOVE YOUR MAJESTY IF SHE
DOES NOT LOVE YOUR MAJESTY THERE IS NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD
INTERFERE WITH YOUR MAJESTYS PLAN
IT IS TRUE AND YETWELL I WISH SHE HAD BEEN OF MY OWN STATION
WHAT A QUEEN SHE WOULD HAVE MADE HE RELAPSED INTO A MOODY SILENCE
WHICH WAS NOT BROKEN UNTIL WE DREW UP IN SERPENTINE AVENUE
THE DOOR OF BRIONY LODGE WAS OPEN AND AN ELDERLY WOMAN STOOD UPON
THE STEPS SHE WATCHED US WITH A SARDONIC EYE AS WE STEPPED FROM THE
BROUGHAM
MR SHERLOCK HOLMES I BELIEVE SAID SHE
I AM MR HOLMES ANSWERED MY COMPANION LOOKING AT HER WITH A
QUESTIONING AND RATHER STARTLED GAZE
INDEED MY MISTRESS TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE LIKELY TO CALL SHE LEFT
THIS MORNING WITH HER HUSBAND BY THE TRAIN FROM CHARING CROSS
FOR THE CONTINENT
WHAT SHERLOCK HOLMES STAGGERED BACK WHITE WITH CHAGRIN AND
SURPRISE DO YOU MEAN THAT SHE HAS LEFT ENGLAND
NEVER TO RETURN
AND THE PAPERS ASKED THE KING HOARSELY ALL IS LOST
WE SHALL SEE HE PUSHED PAST THE SERVANT AND RUSHED INTO THE
DRAWINGROOM FOLLOWED BY THE KING AND MYSELF THE FURNITURE WAS
SCATTERED ABOUT IN EVERY DIRECTION WITH DISMANTLED SHELVES AND OPEN
DRAWERS AS IF THE LADY HAD HURRIEDLY RANSACKED THEM BEFORE HER
FLIGHT HOLMES RUSHED AT THE BELLPULL TORE BACK A SMALL SLIDING
SHUTTER AND PLUNGING IN HIS HAND PULLED OUT A PHOTOGRAPH AND A
LETTER THE PHOTOGRAPH WAS OF IRENE ADLER HERSELF IN EVENING DRESS
THE LETTER WAS SUPERSCRIBED TO SHERLOCK HOLMES ESQ TO BE LEFT TILL
CALLED FOR MY FRIEND TORE IT OPEN AND WE ALL THREE READ IT
TOGETHER IT WAS DATED AT MIDNIGHT OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT AND RAN IN
THIS WAY
MY DEAR MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
YOU REALLY DID IT VERY WELL YOU TOOK ME IN COMPLETELY UNTIL AFTER
THE ALARM OF FIRE I HAD NOT A SUSPICION BUT THEN WHEN I FOUND HOW
I HAD BETRAYED MYSELF I BEGAN TO THINK I HAD BEEN WARNED AGAINST
YOU MONTHS AGO I HAD BEEN TOLD THAT IF THE KING EMPLOYED AN AGENT IT
WOULD CERTAINLY BE YOU AND YOUR ADDRESS HAD BEEN GIVEN ME YET WITH
ALL THIS YOU MADE ME REVEAL WHAT YOU WANTED TO KNOW EVEN AFTER I
BECAME SUSPICIOUS I FOUND IT HARD TO THINK EVIL OF SUCH A DEAR KIND
OLD CLERGYMAN BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN TRAINED AS AN ACTRESS
MYSELF MALE COSTUME IS NOTHING NEW TO ME I OFTEN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
THE FREEDOM WHICH IT GIVES I SENT JOHN THE COACHMAN TO WATCH YOU
RAN UP STAIRS GOT INTO MY WALKINGCLOTHES AS I CALL THEM AND CAME
DOWN JUST AS YOU DEPARTED
WELL I FOLLOWED YOU TO YOUR DOOR AND SO MADE SURE THAT I WAS
REALLY AN OBJECT OF INTEREST TO THE CELEBRATED MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
THEN I RATHER IMPRUDENTLY WISHED YOU GOODNIGHT AND STARTED FOR
THE TEMPLE TO SEE MY HUSBAND
WE BOTH THOUGHT THE BEST RESOURCE WAS FLIGHT WHEN PURSUED BY SO
FORMIDABLE AN ANTAGONIST SO YOU WILL FIND THE NEST EMPTY WHEN YOU
CALL TOMORROW AS TO THE PHOTOGRAPH YOUR CLIENT MAY REST IN PEACE
I LOVE AND AM LOVED BY A BETTER MAN THAN HE THE KING MAY DO WHAT HE
WILL WITHOUT HINDRANCE FROM ONE WHOM HE HAS CRUELLY WRONGED I KEEP
IT ONLY TO SAFEGUARD MYSELF AND TO PRESERVE A WEAPON WHICH WILL
ALWAYS SECURE ME FROM ANY STEPS WHICH HE MIGHT TAKE IN THE FUTURE I
LEAVE A PHOTOGRAPH WHICH HE MIGHT CARE TO POSSESS AND I REMAIN DEAR
MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
VERY TRULY YOURS
IRENE NORTON NE ADLER
WHAT A WOMANOH WHAT A WOMAN CRIED THE KING OF BOHEMIA WHEN WE
HAD ALL THREE READ THIS EPISTLE DID I NOT TELL YOU HOW QUICK AND
RESOLUTE SHE WAS WOULD SHE NOT HAVE MADE AN ADMIRABLE QUEEN IS IT
NOT A PITY THAT SHE WAS NOT ON MY LEVEL FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF THE
LADY SHE SEEMS INDEED TO BE ON A VERY
DIFFERENT LEVEL TO YOUR MAJESTY SAID HOLMES COLDLY I AM SORRY
THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BRING YOUR MAJESTYS BUSINESS TO A MORE
SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION
ON THE CONTRARY MY DEAR SIR CRIED THE KING NOTHING COULD BE
MORE SUCCESSFUL I KNOW THAT HER WORD IS INVIOLATE THE PHOTOGRAPH IS
NOW AS SAFE AS IF IT WERE IN THE FIRE
I AM GLAD TO HEAR YOUR MAJESTY SAY SO
I AM IMMENSELY INDEBTED TO YOU PRAY TELL ME IN WHAT WAY I CAN
REWARD YOU THIS RING HE SLIPPED AN EMERALD SNAKE RING FROM HIS
FINGER AND HELD IT OUT UPON THE PALM OF HIS HAND
YOUR MAJESTY HAS SOMETHING WHICH I SHOULD VALUE EVEN MORE HIGHLY
SAID HOLMES
YOU HAVE BUT TO NAME IT
THIS PHOTOGRAPH
THE KING STARED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT
IRENES PHOTOGRAPH HE CRIED CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH IT
I THANK YOUR MAJESTY THEN THERE IS NO MORE TO BE DONE IN THE
MATTER I HAVE THE HONOUR TO WISH YOU A VERY GOODMORNING HE BOWED
AND TURNING AWAY WITHOUT OBSERVING THE HAND WHICH THE KING HAD
STRETCHED OUT TO HIM HE SET OFF IN MY COMPANY FOR HIS CHAMBERS
AND THAT WAS HOW A GREAT SCANDAL THREATENED TO AFFECT THE KINGDOM OF
BOHEMIA AND HOW THE BEST PLANS OF MR SHERLOCK HOLMES WERE BEATEN BY
A WOMANS WIT HE USED TO MAKE MERRY OVER THE CLEVERNESS OF WOMEN
BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD HIM DO IT OF LATE AND WHEN HE SPEAKS OF IRENE
ADLER OR WHEN HE REFERS TO HER PHOTOGRAPH IT IS ALWAYS UNDER THE
HONOURABLE TITLE OF THE WOMAN
THE REDHEADED LEAGUE
I HAD CALLED UPON MY FRIEND MR SHERLOCK HOLMES ONE DAY IN THE
AUTUMN OF LAST YEAR AND FOUND HIM IN DEEP CONVERSATION WITH A VERY
STOUT FLORIDFACED ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WITH FIERY RED HAIR WITH AN
APOLOGY FOR MY INTRUSION I WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW WHEN HOLMES PULLED
ME ABRUPTLY INTO THE ROOM AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND ME
YOU COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE COME AT A BETTER TIME MY DEAR WATSON
HE SAID CORDIALLY
I WAS AFRAID THAT YOU WERE ENGAGED
SO I AM VERY MUCH SO
THEN I CAN WAIT IN THE NEXT ROOM
NOT AT ALL THIS GENTLEMAN MR WILSON HAS BEEN MY PARTNER AND
HELPER IN MANY OF MY MOST SUCCESSFUL CASES AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT
HE WILL BE OF THE UTMOST USE TO ME IN YOURS ALSO
THE STOUT GENTLEMAN HALF ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GAVE A BOB OF
GREETING WITH A QUICK LITTLE QUESTIONING GLANCE FROM HIS SMALL
FATENCIRCLED EYES
TRY THE SETTEE SAID HOLMES RELAPSING INTO HIS ARMCHAIR AND
PUTTING HIS FINGERTIPS TOGETHER AS WAS HIS CUSTOM WHEN IN JUDICIAL
MOODS I KNOW MY DEAR WATSON THAT YOU SHARE MY LOVE OF ALL THAT IS
BIZARRE AND OUTSIDE THE CONVENTIONS AND HUMDRUM ROUTINE OF EVERYDAY
LIFE YOU HAVE SHOWN YOUR RELISH FOR IT BY THE ENTHUSIASM WHICH HAS
PROMPTED YOU TO CHRONICLE AND IF YOU WILL EXCUSE MY SAYING SO
SOMEWHAT TO EMBELLISH SO MANY OF MY OWN LITTLE ADVENTURES
YOUR CASES HAVE INDEED BEEN OF THE GREATEST INTEREST TO ME I
OBSERVED
YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT I REMARKED THE OTHER DAY JUST BEFORE WE WENT
INTO THE VERY SIMPLE PROBLEM PRESENTED BY MISS MARY SUTHERLAND THAT
FOR STRANGE EFFECTS AND EXTRAORDINARY COMBINATIONS WE MUST GO TO LIFE
ITSELF WHICH IS ALWAYS FAR MORE DARING THAN ANY EFFORT OF THE
IMAGINATION
A PROPOSITION WHICH I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF DOUBTING
YOU DID DOCTOR BUT NONE THE LESS YOU MUST COME ROUND TO MY VIEW
FOR OTHERWISE I SHALL KEEP ON PILING FACT UPON FACT ON YOU UNTIL YOUR
REASON BREAKS DOWN UNDER THEM AND ACKNOWLEDGES ME TO BE RIGHT NOW
MR JABEZ WILSON HERE HAS BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO CALL UPON ME THIS
MORNING AND TO BEGIN A NARRATIVE WHICH PROMISES TO BE ONE OF THE
MOST SINGULAR WHICH I HAVE LISTENED TO FOR SOME TIME YOU HAVE HEARD
ME REMARK THAT THE STRANGEST AND MOST UNIQUE THINGS ARE VERY OFTEN
CONNECTED NOT WITH THE LARGER BUT WITH THE SMALLER CRIMES AND
OCCASIONALLY INDEED WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR DOUBT WHETHER ANY
POSITIVE CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED AS FAR AS I HAVE HEARD IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY WHETHER THE PRESENT CASE IS AN INSTANCE OF
CRIME OR NOT BUT THE COURSE OF EVENTS IS CERTAINLY AMONG THE MOST
SINGULAR THAT I HAVE EVER LISTENED TO PERHAPS MR WILSON YOU WOULD
HAVE THE GREAT KINDNESS TO RECOMMENCE YOUR NARRATIVE I ASK YOU NOT
MERELY BECAUSE MY FRIEND DR WATSON HAS NOT HEARD THE OPENING PART
BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE PECULIAR NATURE OF THE STORY MAKES ME ANXIOUS TO
HAVE EVERY POSSIBLE DETAIL FROM YOUR LIPS AS A RULE WHEN I HAVE
HEARD SOME SLIGHT INDICATION OF THE COURSE OF EVENTS I AM ABLE TO
GUIDE MYSELF BY THE THOUSANDS OF OTHER SIMILAR CASES WHICH OCCUR TO
MY MEMORY IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE I AM FORCED TO ADMIT THAT THE
FACTS ARE TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF UNIQUE
THE PORTLY CLIENT PUFFED OUT HIS CHEST WITH AN APPEARANCE OF SOME
LITTLE PRIDE AND PULLED A DIRTY AND WRINKLED NEWSPAPER FROM THE
INSIDE POCKET OF HIS GREATCOAT AS HE GLANCED DOWN THE ADVERTISEMENT
COLUMN WITH HIS HEAD THRUST FORWARD AND THE PAPER FLATTENED OUT UPON
HIS KNEE I TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT THE MAN AND ENDEAVOURED AFTER THE
FASHION OF MY COMPANION TO READ THE INDICATIONS WHICH MIGHT BE
PRESENTED BY HIS DRESS OR APPEARANCE
I DID NOT GAIN VERY MUCH HOWEVER BY MY INSPECTION OUR VISITOR BORE
EVERY MARK OF BEING AN AVERAGE COMMONPLACE BRITISH TRADESMAN OBESE
POMPOUS AND SLOW HE WORE RATHER BAGGY GREY SHEPHERDS CHECK
TROUSERS A NOT OVERCLEAN BLACK FROCKCOAT UNBUTTONED IN THE FRONT
AND A DRAB WAISTCOAT WITH A HEAVY BRASSY ALBERT CHAIN AND A SQUARE
PIERCED BIT OF METAL DANGLING DOWN AS AN ORNAMENT A FRAYED TOPHAT
AND A FADED BROWN OVERCOAT WITH A WRINKLED VELVET COLLAR LAY UPON A
CHAIR BESIDE HIM ALTOGETHER LOOK AS I WOULD THERE WAS NOTHING
REMARKABLE ABOUT THE MAN SAVE HIS BLAZING RED HEAD AND THE
EXPRESSION OF EXTREME CHAGRIN AND DISCONTENT UPON HIS FEATURES
SHERLOCK HOLMES QUICK EYE TOOK IN MY OCCUPATION AND HE SHOOK HIS
HEAD WITH A SMILE AS HE NOTICED MY QUESTIONING GLANCES BEYOND THE
OBVIOUS FACTS THAT HE HAS AT SOME TIME DONE MANUAL LABOUR THAT HE
TAKES SNUFF THAT HE IS A FREEMASON THAT HE HAS BEEN IN CHINA AND
THAT HE HAS DONE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF WRITING LATELY I CAN
DEDUCE NOTHING ELSE
MR JABEZ WILSON STARTED UP IN HIS CHAIR WITH HIS FOREFINGER UPON
THE PAPER BUT HIS EYES UPON MY COMPANION
HOW IN THE NAME OF GOODFORTUNE DID YOU KNOW ALL THAT MR
HOLMES HE ASKED HOW DID YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT I DID MANUAL
LABOUR ITS AS TRUE AS GOSPEL FOR I BEGAN AS A SHIPS CARPENTER
YOUR HANDS MY DEAR SIR YOUR RIGHT HAND IS QUITE A SIZE LARGER THAN
YOUR LEFT YOU HAVE WORKED WITH IT AND THE MUSCLES ARE MORE
DEVELOPED
WELL THE SNUFF THEN AND THE FREEMASONRY
I WONT INSULT YOUR INTELLIGENCE BY TELLING YOU HOW I READ THAT
ESPECIALLY AS RATHER AGAINST THE STRICT RULES OF YOUR ORDER YOU USE
AN ARCANDCOMPASS BREASTPIN
AH OF COURSE I FORGOT THAT BUT THE WRITING
WHAT ELSE CAN BE INDICATED BY THAT RIGHT CUFF SO VERY SHINY FOR FIVE
INCHES AND THE LEFT ONE WITH THE SMOOTH PATCH NEAR THE ELBOW WHERE
YOU REST IT UPON THE DESK
WELL BUT CHINA
THE FISH THAT YOU HAVE TATTOOED IMMEDIATELY ABOVE YOUR RIGHT WRIST
COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN DONE IN CHINA I HAVE MADE A SMALL STUDY OF
TATTOO MARKS AND HAVE EVEN CONTRIBUTED TO THE LITERATURE OF THE
SUBJECT THAT TRICK OF STAINING THE FISHES SCALES OF A DELICATE PINK
IS QUITE PECULIAR TO CHINA WHEN IN ADDITION I SEE A CHINESE COIN
HANGING FROM YOUR WATCHCHAIN THE MATTER BECOMES EVEN MORE SIMPLE
MR JABEZ WILSON LAUGHED HEAVILY WELL I NEVER SAID HE I
THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT YOU HAD DONE SOMETHING CLEVER BUT I SEE THAT
THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT AFTER ALL
I BEGIN TO THINK WATSON SAID HOLMES THAT I MAKE A MISTAKE IN
EXPLAINING OMNE IGNOTUM PRO MAGNIFICO YOU KNOW AND MY POOR
LITTLE REPUTATION SUCH AS IT IS WILL SUFFER SHIPWRECK IF I AM SO
CANDID CAN YOU NOT FIND THE ADVERTISEMENT MR WILSON
YES I HAVE GOT IT NOW HE ANSWERED WITH HIS THICK RED FINGER
PLANTED HALFWAY DOWN THE COLUMN HERE IT IS THIS IS WHAT BEGAN IT
ALL YOU JUST READ IT FOR YOURSELF SIR
I TOOK THE PAPER FROM HIM AND READ AS FOLLOWS
TO THE REDHEADED LEAGUE ON ACCOUNT OF THE BEQUEST OF THE LATE
EZEKIAH HOPKINS OF LEBANON PENNSYLVANIA U S A THERE IS NOW
ANOTHER VACANCY OPEN WHICH ENTITLES A MEMBER OF THE LEAGUE TO A
SALARY OF A WEEK FOR PURELY NOMINAL SERVICES ALL REDHEADED MEN
WHO ARE SOUND IN BODY AND MIND AND ABOVE THE AGE OF TWENTYONE YEARS
ARE ELIGIBLE APPLY IN PERSON ON MONDAY AT ELEVEN OCLOCK TO DUNCAN
ROSS AT THE OFFICES OF THE LEAGUE POPES COURT FLEET STREET
WHAT ON EARTH DOES THIS MEAN I EJACULATED AFTER I HAD TWICE READ
OVER THE EXTRAORDINARY ANNOUNCEMENT
HOLMES CHUCKLED AND WRIGGLED IN HIS CHAIR AS WAS HIS HABIT WHEN IN
HIGH SPIRITS IT IS A LITTLE OFF THE BEATEN TRACK ISNT IT SAID
HE AND NOW MR WILSON OFF YOU GO AT SCRATCH AND TELL US ALL ABOUT
YOURSELF YOUR HOUSEHOLD AND THE EFFECT WHICH THIS ADVERTISEMENT HAD
UPON YOUR FORTUNES YOU WILL FIRST MAKE A NOTE DOCTOR OF THE PAPER
AND THE DATE
IT IS THE MORNING CHRONICLE OF APRIL JUST TWO MONTHS AGO
VERY GOOD NOW MR WILSON
WELL IT IS JUST AS I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
SAID JABEZ WILSON MOPPING HIS FOREHEAD I HAVE A SMALL PAWNBROKERS
BUSINESS AT COBURG SQUARE NEAR THE CITY ITS NOT A VERY LARGE
AFFAIR AND OF LATE YEARS IT HAS NOT DONE MORE THAN JUST GIVE ME A
LIVING I USED TO BE ABLE TO KEEP TWO ASSISTANTS BUT NOW I ONLY KEEP
ONE AND I WOULD HAVE A JOB TO PAY HIM BUT THAT HE IS WILLING TO COME
FOR HALF WAGES SO AS TO LEARN THE BUSINESS
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS OBLIGING YOUTH ASKED SHERLOCK HOLMES
HIS NAME IS VINCENT SPAULDING AND HES NOT SUCH A YOUTH EITHER
ITS HARD TO SAY HIS AGE I SHOULD NOT WISH A SMARTER ASSISTANT MR
HOLMES AND I KNOW VERY WELL THAT HE COULD BETTER HIMSELF AND EARN
TWICE WHAT I AM ABLE TO GIVE HIM BUT AFTER ALL IF HE IS SATISFIED
WHY SHOULD I PUT IDEAS IN HIS HEAD
WHY INDEED YOU SEEM MOST FORTUNATE IN HAVING AN EMPLOYEE WHO COMES
UNDER THE FULL MARKET PRICE IT IS NOT A COMMON EXPERIENCE AMONG
EMPLOYERS IN THIS AGE I DONT KNOW THAT YOUR ASSISTANT IS NOT AS
REMARKABLE AS YOUR ADVERTISEMENT
OH HE HAS HIS FAULTS TOO SAID MR WILSON NEVER WAS SUCH A
FELLOW FOR PHOTOGRAPHY SNAPPING AWAY WITH A CAMERA WHEN HE OUGHT TO
BE IMPROVING HIS MIND AND THEN DIVING DOWN INTO THE CELLAR LIKE A
RABBIT INTO ITS HOLE TO DEVELOP HIS PICTURES THAT IS HIS MAIN FAULT
BUT ON THE WHOLE HES A GOOD WORKER THERES NO VICE IN HIM
HE IS STILL WITH YOU I PRESUME
YES SIR HE AND A GIRL OF FOURTEEN WHO DOES A BIT OF SIMPLE
COOKING AND KEEPS THE PLACE CLEANTHATS ALL I HAVE IN THE HOUSE
FOR I AM A WIDOWER AND NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY WE LIVE VERY QUIETLY
SIR THE THREE OF US AND WE KEEP A ROOF OVER OUR HEADS AND PAY OUR
DEBTS IF WE DO NOTHING MORE
THE FIRST THING THAT PUT US OUT WAS THAT ADVERTISEMENT SPAULDING
HE CAME DOWN INTO THE OFFICE JUST THIS DAY EIGHT WEEKS WITH THIS
VERY PAPER IN HIS HAND AND HE SAYS
I WISH TO THE LORD MR WILSON THAT I WAS A REDHEADED MAN
WHY THAT I ASKS
WHY SAYS HE HERES ANOTHER VACANCY ON THE LEAGUE OF THE
REDHEADED MEN ITS WORTH QUITE A LITTLE FORTUNE TO ANY MAN WHO GETS
IT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE MORE VACANCIES THAN THERE ARE
MEN SO THAT THE TRUSTEES ARE AT THEIR WITS END WHAT TO DO WITH THE
MONEY IF MY HAIR WOULD ONLY CHANGE COLOUR HERES A NICE LITTLE CRIB
ALL READY FOR ME TO STEP INTO
WHY WHAT IS IT THEN I ASKED YOU SEE MR HOLMES I AM A VERY
STAYATHOME MAN AND AS MY BUSINESS CAME TO ME INSTEAD OF MY HAVING
TO GO TO IT I WAS OFTEN WEEKS ON END WITHOUT PUTTING MY FOOT OVER
THE DOORMAT IN THAT WAY I DIDNT KNOW MUCH OF WHAT WAS GOING ON
OUTSIDE AND I WAS ALWAYS GLAD OF A BIT OF NEWS
HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE LEAGUE OF THE REDHEADED MEN HE ASKED
WITH HIS EYES OPEN
NEVER
WHY I WONDER AT THAT FOR YOU ARE ELIGIBLE YOURSELF FOR ONE OF THE
VACANCIES
AND WHAT ARE THEY WORTH I ASKED
OH MERELY A COUPLE OF HUNDRED A YEAR BUT THE WORK IS SLIGHT AND
IT NEED NOT INTERFERE VERY MUCH WITH ONES OTHER OCCUPATIONS
WELL YOU CAN EASILY THINK THAT THAT MADE ME PRICK UP MY EARS FOR
THE BUSINESS HAS NOT BEEN OVERGOOD FOR SOME YEARS AND AN EXTRA
COUPLE OF HUNDRED WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HANDY
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT SAID I
WELL SAID HE SHOWING ME THE ADVERTISEMENT YOU CAN SEE FOR
YOURSELF THAT THE LEAGUE HAS A VACANCY AND THERE IS THE ADDRESS
WHERE YOU SHOULD APPLY FOR PARTICULARS AS FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT THE
LEAGUE WAS FOUNDED BY AN AMERICAN MILLIONAIRE EZEKIAH HOPKINS WHO
WAS VERY PECULIAR IN HIS WAYS HE WAS HIMSELF REDHEADED AND HE HAD
A GREAT SYMPATHY FOR ALL REDHEADED MEN SO WHEN HE DIED IT WAS FOUND
THAT HE HAD LEFT HIS ENORMOUS FORTUNE IN THE HANDS OF TRUSTEES WITH
INSTRUCTIONS TO APPLY THE INTEREST TO THE PROVIDING OF EASY BERTHS TO
MEN WHOSE HAIR IS OF THAT COLOUR FROM ALL I HEAR IT IS SPLENDID PAY
AND VERY LITTLE TO DO
BUT SAID I THERE WOULD BE MILLIONS OF REDHEADED MEN WHO WOULD
APPLY
NOT SO MANY AS YOU MIGHT THINK HE ANSWERED YOU SEE IT IS REALLY
CONFINED TO LONDONERS AND TO GROWN MEN THIS AMERICAN HAD STARTED
FROM LONDON WHEN HE WAS YOUNG AND HE WANTED TO DO THE OLD TOWN A
GOOD TURN THEN AGAIN I HAVE HEARD IT IS NO USE YOUR APPLYING IF
YOUR HAIR IS LIGHT RED OR DARK RED OR ANYTHING BUT REAL BRIGHT
BLAZING FIERY RED NOW IF YOU CARED TO APPLY MR WILSON YOU WOULD
JUST WALK IN BUT PERHAPS IT WOULD HARDLY BE WORTH YOUR WHILE TO PUT
YOURSELF OUT OF THE WAY FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW HUNDRED POUNDS
NOW IT IS A FACT GENTLEMEN AS YOU MAY SEE FOR YOURSELVES THAT MY
HAIR IS OF A VERY FULL AND RICH TINT SO THAT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IF
THERE WAS TO BE ANY COMPETITION IN THE MATTER I STOOD AS GOOD A
CHANCE AS ANY MAN THAT I HAD EVER MET VINCENT SPAULDING SEEMED TO
KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT IT THAT I THOUGHT HE MIGHT PROVE USEFUL SO I JUST
ORDERED HIM TO PUT UP THE SHUTTERS FOR THE DAY AND TO COME RIGHT AWAY
WITH ME HE WAS VERY WILLING TO HAVE A HOLIDAY SO WE SHUT THE
BUSINESS UP AND STARTED OFF FOR THE ADDRESS THAT WAS GIVEN US IN THE
ADVERTISEMENT
I NEVER HOPE TO SEE SUCH A SIGHT AS THAT AGAIN MR HOLMES FROM
NORTH SOUTH EAST AND WEST EVERY MAN WHO HAD A SHADE OF RED IN HIS
HAIR HAD TRAMPED INTO THE CITY TO ANSWER THE ADVERTISEMENT FLEET
STREET WAS CHOKED WITH REDHEADED FOLK AND POPES COURT LOOKED LIKE
A COSTERS ORANGE BARROW I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT THERE WERE SO
MANY IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY AS WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER BY THAT SINGLE
ADVERTISEMENT EVERY SHADE OF COLOUR THEY WERESTRAW LEMON ORANGE
BRICK IRISHSETTER LIVER CLAY BUT AS SPAULDING SAID THERE WERE
NOT MANY WHO HAD THE REAL VIVID FLAMECOLOURED TINT WHEN I SAW HOW
MANY WERE WAITING I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT UP IN DESPAIR BUT SPAULDING
WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT HOW HE DID IT I COULD NOT IMAGINE BUT HE
PUSHED AND PULLED AND BUTTED UNTIL HE GOT ME THROUGH THE CROWD AND
RIGHT UP TO THE STEPS WHICH LED TO THE OFFICE THERE WAS A DOUBLE
STREAM UPON THE STAIR SOME GOING UP IN HOPE AND SOME COMING BACK
DEJECTED BUT WE WEDGED IN AS WELL AS WE COULD AND SOON FOUND
OURSELVES IN THE OFFICE
YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN A MOST ENTERTAINING ONE REMARKED HOLMES
AS HIS CLIENT PAUSED AND REFRESHED HIS MEMORY WITH A HUGE PINCH OF
SNUFF PRAY CONTINUE YOUR VERY INTERESTING STATEMENT
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE OFFICE BUT A COUPLE OF WOODEN CHAIRS AND A
DEAL TABLE BEHIND WHICH SAT A SMALL MAN WITH A HEAD THAT WAS EVEN
REDDER THAN MINE HE SAID A FEW WORDS TO EACH CANDIDATE AS HE CAME
UP AND THEN HE ALWAYS MANAGED TO FIND SOME FAULT IN THEM WHICH WOULD
DISQUALIFY THEM GETTING A VACANCY DID NOT SEEM TO BE SUCH A VERY
EASY MATTER AFTER ALL HOWEVER WHEN OUR TURN CAME THE LITTLE MAN
WAS MUCH MORE FAVOURABLE TO ME THAN TO ANY OF THE OTHERS AND HE
CLOSED THE DOOR AS WE ENTERED SO THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A PRIVATE WORD
WITH US
THIS IS MR JABEZ WILSON SAID MY ASSISTANT AND HE IS WILLING TO
FILL A VACANCY IN THE LEAGUE
AND HE IS ADMIRABLY SUITED FOR IT THE OTHER ANSWERED HE HAS
EVERY REQUIREMENT I CANNOT RECALL WHEN I HAVE SEEN ANYTHING SO
FINE HE TOOK A STEP BACKWARD COCKED HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND
GAZED AT MY HAIR UNTIL I FELT QUITE BASHFUL THEN SUDDENLY HE PLUNGED
FORWARD WRUNG MY HAND AND CONGRATULATED ME WARMLY ON MY SUCCESS
IT WOULD BE INJUSTICE TO HESITATE SAID HE YOU WILL HOWEVER I
AM SURE EXCUSE ME FOR TAKING AN OBVIOUS PRECAUTION WITH THAT HE
SEIZED MY HAIR IN BOTH HIS HANDS AND TUGGED UNTIL I YELLED WITH THE
PAIN THERE IS WATER IN YOUR EYES SAID HE AS HE RELEASED ME I
PERCEIVE THAT ALL IS AS IT SHOULD BE BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL FOR
WE HAVE TWICE BEEN DECEIVED BY WIGS AND ONCE BY PAINT I COULD TELL
YOU TALES OF COBBLERS WAX WHICH WOULD DISGUST YOU WITH HUMAN
NATURE HE STEPPED OVER TO THE WINDOW AND SHOUTED THROUGH IT AT THE
TOP OF HIS VOICE THAT THE VACANCY WAS FILLED A GROAN OF
DISAPPOINTMENT CAME UP FROM BELOW AND THE FOLK ALL TROOPED AWAY IN
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS UNTIL THERE WAS NOT A REDHEAD TO BE SEEN EXCEPT
MY OWN AND THAT OF THE MANAGER
MY NAME SAID HE IS MR DUNCAN ROSS AND I AM MYSELF ONE OF THE
PENSIONERS UPON THE FUND LEFT BY OUR NOBLE BENEFACTOR ARE YOU A
MARRIED MAN MR WILSON HAVE YOU A FAMILY
I ANSWERED THAT I HAD NOT
HIS FACE FELL IMMEDIATELY
DEAR ME HE SAID GRAVELY THAT IS VERY SERIOUS INDEED I AM SORRY
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT THE FUND WAS OF COURSE FOR THE PROPAGATION
AND SPREAD OF THE REDHEADS AS WELL AS FOR THEIR MAINTENANCE IT IS
EXCEEDINGLY UNFORTUNATE THAT YOU SHOULD BE A BACHELOR
MY FACE LENGTHENED AT THIS MR HOLMES FOR I THOUGHT THAT I WAS NOT
TO HAVE THE VACANCY AFTER ALL BUT AFTER THINKING IT OVER FOR A FEW
MINUTES HE SAID THAT IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT
IN THE CASE OF ANOTHER SAID HE THE OBJECTION MIGHT BE FATAL
BUT WE MUST STRETCH A POINT IN FAVOUR OF A MAN WITH SUCH A HEAD OF
HAIR AS YOURS WHEN SHALL YOU BE ABLE TO ENTER UPON YOUR NEW DUTIES
WELL IT IS A LITTLE AWKWARD FOR I HAVE A BUSINESS ALREADY SAID
I
OH NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT MR WILSON SAID VINCENT SPAULDING I
SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AFTER THAT FOR YOU
WHAT WOULD BE THE HOURS I ASKED
TEN TO TWO
NOW A PAWNBROKERS BUSINESS IS MOSTLY DONE OF AN EVENING MR
HOLMES ESPECIALLY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY EVENING WHICH IS JUST BEFORE
PAYDAY SO IT WOULD SUIT ME VERY WELL TO EARN A LITTLE IN THE
MORNINGS BESIDES I KNEW THAT MY ASSISTANT WAS A GOOD MAN AND THAT
HE WOULD SEE TO ANYTHING THAT TURNED UP
THAT WOULD SUIT ME VERY WELL SAID I AND THE PAY
IS A WEEK
AND THE WORK
IS PURELY NOMINAL
WHAT DO YOU CALL PURELY NOMINAL
WELL YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE OFFICE OR AT LEAST IN THE BUILDING
THE WHOLE TIME IF YOU LEAVE YOU FORFEIT YOUR WHOLE POSITION
FOREVER THE WILL IS VERY CLEAR UPON THAT POINT YOU DONT COMPLY
WITH THE CONDITIONS IF YOU BUDGE FROM THE OFFICE DURING THAT TIME
ITS ONLY FOUR HOURS A DAY AND I SHOULD NOT THINK OF LEAVING
SAID I
NO EXCUSE WILL AVAIL SAID MR DUNCAN ROSS NEITHER SICKNESS NOR
BUSINESS NOR ANYTHING ELSE THERE YOU MUST STAY OR YOU LOSE YOUR
BILLET
AND THE WORK
IS TO COPY OUT THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA THERE IS THE FIRST
VOLUME OF IT IN THAT PRESS YOU MUST FIND YOUR OWN INK PENS AND
BLOTTINGPAPER BUT WE PROVIDE THIS TABLE AND CHAIR WILL YOU BE
READY TOMORROW
CERTAINLY I ANSWERED
THEN GOODBYE MR JABEZ WILSON AND LET ME CONGRATULATE YOU ONCE
MORE ON THE IMPORTANT POSITION WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO GAIN HE BOWED ME OUT OF THE ROOM AND I WENT HOME WITH MY
ASSISTANT HARDLY KNOWING WHAT TO SAY OR DO I WAS SO PLEASED AT MY
OWN GOOD FORTUNE
WELL I THOUGHT OVER THE MATTER ALL DAY AND BY EVENING I WAS IN LOW
SPIRITS AGAIN FOR I HAD QUITE PERSUADED MYSELF THAT THE WHOLE AFFAIR
MUST BE SOME GREAT HOAX OR FRAUD THOUGH WHAT ITS OBJECT MIGHT BE I
COULD NOT IMAGINE IT SEEMED ALTOGETHER PAST BELIEF THAT ANYONE COULD
MAKE SUCH A WILL OR THAT THEY WOULD PAY SUCH A SUM FOR DOING
ANYTHING SO SIMPLE AS COPYING OUT THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA
VINCENT SPAULDING DID WHAT HE COULD TO CHEER ME UP BUT BY BEDTIME I
HAD REASONED MYSELF OUT OF THE WHOLE THING HOWEVER IN THE MORNING I
DETERMINED TO HAVE A LOOK AT IT ANYHOW SO I BOUGHT A PENNY BOTTLE OF
INK AND WITH A QUILLPEN AND SEVEN SHEETS OF FOOLSCAP PAPER I
STARTED OFF FOR POPES COURT
WELL TO MY SURPRISE AND DELIGHT EVERYTHING WAS AS RIGHT AS
POSSIBLE THE TABLE WAS SET OUT READY FOR ME AND MR DUNCAN ROSS WAS
THERE TO SEE THAT I GOT FAIRLY TO WORK HE STARTED ME OFF UPON THE
LETTER A AND THEN HE LEFT ME BUT HE WOULD DROP IN FROM TIME TO TIME
TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT WITH ME AT TWO OCLOCK HE BADE ME
GOODDAY COMPLIMENTED ME UPON THE AMOUNT THAT I HAD WRITTEN AND
LOCKED THE DOOR OF THE OFFICE AFTER ME
THIS WENT ON DAY AFTER DAY MR HOLMES AND ON SATURDAY THE MANAGER
CAME IN AND PLANKED DOWN FOUR GOLDEN SOVEREIGNS FOR MY WEEKS WORK
IT WAS THE SAME NEXT WEEK AND THE SAME THE WEEK AFTER EVERY MORNING
I WAS THERE AT TEN AND EVERY AFTERNOON I LEFT AT TWO BY DEGREES MR
DUNCAN ROSS TOOK TO COMING IN ONLY ONCE OF A MORNING AND THEN AFTER
A TIME HE DID NOT COME IN AT ALL STILL OF COURSE I NEVER DARED TO
LEAVE THE ROOM FOR AN INSTANT FOR I WAS NOT SURE WHEN HE MIGHT COME
AND THE BILLET WAS SUCH A GOOD ONE AND SUITED ME SO WELL THAT I
WOULD NOT RISK THE LOSS OF IT
EIGHT WEEKS PASSED AWAY LIKE THIS AND I HAD WRITTEN ABOUT ABBOTS
AND ARCHERY AND ARMOUR AND ARCHITECTURE AND ATTICA AND HOPED WITH
DILIGENCE THAT I MIGHT GET ON TO THE BS BEFORE VERY LONG IT COST ME
SOMETHING IN FOOLSCAP AND I HAD PRETTY NEARLY FILLED A SHELF WITH MY
WRITINGS AND THEN SUDDENLY THE WHOLE BUSINESS CAME TO AN END
TO AN END
YES SIR AND NO LATER THAN THIS MORNING I WENT TO MY WORK AS USUAL
AT TEN OCLOCK BUT THE DOOR WAS SHUT AND LOCKED WITH A LITTLE
SQUARE OF CARDBOARD HAMMERED ON TO THE MIDDLE OF THE PANEL WITH A
TACK HERE IT IS AND YOU CAN READ FOR YOURSELF
HE HELD UP A PIECE OF WHITE CARDBOARD ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHEET OF
NOTEPAPER IT READ IN THIS FASHION
THE REDHEADED LEAGUE
IS
DISSOLVED
OCTOBER SHERLOCK HOLMES AND I SURVEYED THIS CURT ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE
RUEFUL
FACE BEHIND IT UNTIL THE COMICAL SIDE OF THE AFFAIR SO COMPLETELY
OVERTOPPED EVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION THAT WE BOTH BURST OUT INTO A
ROAR OF LAUGHTER
I CANNOT SEE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING VERY FUNNY CRIED OUR CLIENT
FLUSHING UP TO THE ROOTS OF HIS FLAMING HEAD IF YOU CAN DO NOTHING
BETTER THAN LAUGH AT ME I CAN GO ELSEWHERE
NO NO CRIED HOLMES SHOVING HIM BACK INTO THE CHAIR FROM WHICH HE
HAD HALF RISEN I REALLY WOULDNT MISS YOUR CASE FOR THE WORLD IT
IS MOST REFRESHINGLY UNUSUAL BUT THERE IS IF YOU WILL EXCUSE MY
SAYING SO SOMETHING JUST A LITTLE FUNNY ABOUT IT PRAY WHAT STEPS
DID YOU TAKE WHEN YOU FOUND THE CARD UPON THE DOOR
I WAS STAGGERED SIR I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO THEN I CALLED AT
THE OFFICES ROUND BUT NONE OF THEM SEEMED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
FINALLY I WENT TO THE LANDLORD WHO IS AN ACCOUNTANT LIVING ON THE
GROUNDFLOOR AND I ASKED HIM IF HE COULD TELL ME WHAT HAD BECOME OF
THE REDHEADED LEAGUE HE SAID THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANY SUCH
BODY THEN I ASKED HIM WHO MR DUNCAN ROSS WAS HE ANSWERED THAT THE
NAME WAS NEW TO HIM
WELL SAID I THE GENTLEMAN AT NO WHAT THE REDHEADED MAN
YES
OH SAID HE HIS NAME WAS WILLIAM MORRIS HE WAS A SOLICITOR AND
WAS USING MY ROOM AS A TEMPORARY CONVENIENCE UNTIL HIS NEW PREMISES
WERE READY HE MOVED OUT YESTERDAY
WHERE COULD I FIND HIM
OH AT HIS NEW OFFICES HE DID TELL ME THE ADDRESS YES KING
EDWARD STREET NEAR ST PAULS
I STARTED OFF MR HOLMES BUT WHEN I GOT TO THAT ADDRESS IT WAS A
MANUFACTORY OF ARTIFICIAL KNEECAPS AND NO ONE IN IT HAD EVER HEARD
OF EITHER MR WILLIAM MORRIS OR MR DUNCAN ROSS
AND WHAT DID YOU DO THEN ASKED HOLMES
I WENT HOME TO SAXECOBURG SQUARE AND I TOOK THE ADVICE OF MY
ASSISTANT BUT HE COULD NOT HELP ME IN ANY WAY HE COULD ONLY SAY
THAT IF I WAITED I SHOULD HEAR BY POST BUT THAT WAS NOT QUITE GOOD
ENOUGH MR HOLMES I DID NOT WISH TO LOSE SUCH A PLACE WITHOUT A
STRUGGLE SO AS I HAD HEARD THAT YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO GIVE ADVICE
TO POOR FOLK WHO WERE IN NEED OF IT I CAME RIGHT AWAY TO YOU
AND YOU DID VERY WISELY SAID HOLMES YOUR CASE IS AN EXCEEDINGLY
REMARKABLE ONE AND I SHALL BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO IT FROM WHAT YOU
HAVE TOLD ME I THINK THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT GRAVER ISSUES HANG FROM
IT THAN MIGHT AT FIRST SIGHT APPEAR
GRAVE ENOUGH SAID MR JABEZ WILSON WHY I HAVE LOST FOUR POUND A
WEEK
AS FAR AS YOU ARE PERSONALLY CONCERNED REMARKED HOLMES I DO NOT
SEE THAT YOU HAVE ANY GRIEVANCE AGAINST THIS EXTRAORDINARY LEAGUE ON
THE CONTRARY YOU ARE AS I UNDERSTAND RICHER BY SOME TO SAY
NOTHING OF THE MINUTE KNOWLEDGE WHICH YOU HAVE GAINED ON EVERY
SUBJECT WHICH COMES UNDER THE LETTER A YOU HAVE LOST NOTHING BY
THEM
NO SIR BUT I WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT THEM AND WHO THEY ARE AND
WHAT THEIR OBJECT WAS IN PLAYING THIS PRANKIF IT WAS A PRANKUPON
ME IT WAS A PRETTY EXPENSIVE JOKE FOR THEM FOR IT COST THEM TWO AND
THIRTY POUNDS
WE SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO CLEAR UP THESE POINTS FOR YOU AND FIRST ONE
OR TWO QUESTIONS MR WILSON THIS ASSISTANT OF YOURS WHO FIRST
CALLED YOUR ATTENTION TO THE ADVERTISEMENTHOW LONG HAD HE BEEN WITH
YOU
ABOUT A MONTH THEN
HOW DID HE COME
IN ANSWER TO AN ADVERTISEMENT
WAS HE THE ONLY APPLICANT
NO I HAD A DOZEN
WHY DID YOU PICK HIM
BECAUSE HE WAS HANDY AND WOULD COME CHEAP
AT HALFWAGES IN FACT
YES
WHAT IS HE LIKE THIS VINCENT SPAULDING
SMALL STOUTBUILT VERY QUICK IN HIS WAYS NO HAIR ON HIS FACE
THOUGH HES NOT SHORT OF THIRTY HAS A WHITE SPLASH OF ACID UPON HIS
FOREHEAD
HOLMES SAT UP IN HIS CHAIR IN CONSIDERABLE EXCITEMENT I THOUGHT AS
MUCH SAID HE HAVE YOU EVER OBSERVED THAT HIS EARS ARE PIERCED FOR
EARRINGS
YES SIR HE TOLD ME THAT A GIPSY HAD DONE IT FOR HIM WHEN HE WAS A
LAD
HUM SAID HOLMES SINKING BACK IN DEEP THOUGHT HE IS STILL WITH
YOU
OH YES SIR I HAVE ONLY JUST LEFT HIM
AND HAS YOUR BUSINESS BEEN ATTENDED TO IN YOUR ABSENCE
NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF SIR THERES NEVER VERY MUCH TO DO OF A
MORNING
THAT WILL DO MR WILSON I SHALL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU AN OPINION
UPON THE SUBJECT IN THE COURSE OF A DAY OR TWO TODAY IS SATURDAY
AND I HOPE THAT BY MONDAY WE MAY COME TO A CONCLUSION
WELL WATSON SAID HOLMES WHEN OUR VISITOR HAD LEFT US WHAT DO
YOU MAKE OF IT ALL
I MAKE NOTHING OF IT I ANSWERED FRANKLY IT IS A MOST MYSTERIOUS
BUSINESS
AS A RULE SAID HOLMES THE MORE BIZARRE A THING IS THE LESS
MYSTERIOUS IT PROVES TO BE IT IS YOUR COMMONPLACE FEATURELESS
CRIMES WHICH ARE REALLY PUZZLING JUST AS A COMMONPLACE FACE IS THE
MOST DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY BUT I MUST BE PROMPT OVER THIS MATTER
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THEN I ASKED
TO SMOKE HE ANSWERED IT IS QUITE A THREE PIPE PROBLEM AND I BEG
THAT YOU WONT SPEAK TO ME FOR FIFTY MINUTES HE CURLED HIMSELF UP
IN HIS CHAIR WITH HIS THIN KNEES DRAWN UP TO HIS HAWKLIKE NOSE AND
THERE HE SAT WITH HIS EYES CLOSED AND HIS BLACK CLAY PIPE THRUSTING
OUT LIKE THE BILL OF SOME STRANGE BIRD I HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT HE HAD DROPPED ASLEEP AND INDEED WAS NODDING MYSELF WHEN HE
SUDDENLY SPRANG OUT OF HIS CHAIR WITH THE GESTURE OF A MAN WHO HAS
MADE UP HIS MIND AND PUT HIS PIPE DOWN UPON THE MANTELPIECE
SARASATE PLAYS AT THE ST JAMESS HALL THIS AFTERNOON HE REMARKED
WHAT DO YOU THINK WATSON COULD YOUR PATIENTS SPARE YOU FOR A FEW
HOURS
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO TODAY MY PRACTICE IS NEVER VERY ABSORBING
THEN PUT ON YOUR HAT AND COME I AM GOING THROUGH THE CITY FIRST
AND WE CAN HAVE SOME LUNCH ON THE WAY I OBSERVE THAT THERE IS A GOOD
DEAL OF GERMAN MUSIC ON THE PROGRAMME WHICH IS RATHER MORE TO MY
TASTE THAN ITALIAN OR FRENCH IT IS INTROSPECTIVE AND I WANT TO
INTROSPECT COME ALONG
WE TRAVELLED BY THE UNDERGROUND AS FAR AS ALDERSGATE AND A SHORT
WALK TOOK US TO SAXECOBURG SQUARE THE SCENE OF THE SINGULAR STORY
WHICH WE HAD LISTENED TO IN THE MORNING IT WAS A POKY LITTLE
SHABBYGENTEEL PLACE WHERE FOUR LINES OF DINGY TWOSTORIED BRICK
HOUSES LOOKED OUT INTO A SMALL RAILEDIN ENCLOSURE WHERE A LAWN OF
WEEDY GRASS AND A FEW CLUMPS OF FADED LAURELBUSHES MADE A HARD FIGHT
AGAINST A SMOKELADEN AND UNCONGENIAL ATMOSPHERE THREE GILT BALLS
AND A BROWN BOARD WITH JABEZ WILSON IN WHITE LETTERS UPON A CORNER
HOUSE ANNOUNCED THE PLACE WHERE OUR REDHEADED CLIENT CARRIED ON HIS
BUSINESS SHERLOCK HOLMES STOPPED IN FRONT OF IT WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE
SIDE AND LOOKED IT ALL OVER WITH HIS EYES SHINING BRIGHTLY BETWEEN
PUCKERED LIDS THEN HE WALKED SLOWLY UP THE STREET AND THEN DOWN
AGAIN TO THE CORNER STILL LOOKING KEENLY AT THE HOUSES FINALLY HE
RETURNED TO THE PAWNBROKERS AND HAVING THUMPED VIGOROUSLY UPON THE
PAVEMENT WITH HIS STICK TWO OR THREE TIMES HE WENT UP TO THE DOOR
AND KNOCKED IT WAS INSTANTLY OPENED BY A BRIGHTLOOKING
CLEANSHAVEN YOUNG FELLOW WHO ASKED HIM TO STEP IN
THANK YOU SAID HOLMES I ONLY WISHED TO ASK YOU HOW YOU WOULD GO
FROM HERE TO THE STRAND
THIRD RIGHT FOURTH LEFT ANSWERED THE ASSISTANT PROMPTLY CLOSING
THE DOOR
SMART FELLOW THAT OBSERVED HOLMES AS WE WALKED AWAY HE IS IN
MY JUDGMENT THE FOURTH SMARTEST MAN IN LONDON AND FOR DARING I AM
NOT SURE THAT HE HAS NOT A CLAIM TO BE THIRD I HAVE KNOWN SOMETHING
OF HIM BEFORE
EVIDENTLY SAID I MR WILSONS ASSISTANT COUNTS FOR A GOOD DEAL
IN THIS MYSTERY OF THE REDHEADED LEAGUE I AM SURE THAT YOU INQUIRED
YOUR WAY MERELY IN ORDER THAT YOU MIGHT SEE HIM
NOT HIM
WHAT THEN
THE KNEES OF HIS TROUSERS
AND WHAT DID YOU SEE
WHAT I EXPECTED TO SEE
WHY DID YOU BEAT THE PAVEMENT
MY DEAR DOCTOR THIS IS A TIME FOR OBSERVATION NOT FOR TALK WE ARE
SPIES IN AN ENEMYS COUNTRY WE KNOW SOMETHING OF SAXECOBURG SQUARE
LET US NOW EXPLORE THE PARTS WHICH LIE BEHIND IT
THE ROAD IN WHICH WE FOUND OURSELVES AS WE TURNED ROUND THE CORNER
FROM THE RETIRED SAXECOBURG SQUARE PRESENTED AS GREAT A CONTRAST TO
IT AS THE FRONT OF A PICTURE DOES TO THE BACK IT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN
ARTERIES WHICH CONVEYED THE TRAFFIC OF THE CITY TO THE NORTH AND
WEST THE ROADWAY WAS BLOCKED WITH THE IMMENSE STREAM OF COMMERCE
FLOWING IN A DOUBLE TIDE INWARD AND OUTWARD WHILE THE FOOTPATHS WERE
BLACK WITH THE HURRYING SWARM OF PEDESTRIANS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO
REALISE AS WE LOOKED AT THE LINE OF FINE SHOPS AND STATELY BUSINESS
PREMISES THAT THEY REALLY ABUTTED ON THE OTHER SIDE UPON THE FADED
AND STAGNANT SQUARE WHICH WE HAD JUST QUITTED
LET ME SEE SAID HOLMES STANDING AT THE CORNER AND GLANCING ALONG
THE LINE I SHOULD LIKE JUST TO REMEMBER THE ORDER OF THE HOUSES
HERE IT IS A HOBBY OF MINE TO HAVE AN EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF LONDON
THERE IS MORTIMERS THE TOBACCONIST THE LITTLE NEWSPAPER SHOP THE
COBURG BRANCH OF THE CITY AND SUBURBAN BANK THE VEGETARIAN
RESTAURANT AND MCFARLANES CARRIAGEBUILDING DEPOT THAT CARRIES US
RIGHT ON TO THE OTHER BLOCK AND NOW DOCTOR WEVE DONE OUR WORK SO
ITS TIME WE HAD SOME PLAY A SANDWICH AND A CUP OF COFFEE AND THEN
OFF TO VIOLINLAND WHERE ALL IS SWEETNESS AND DELICACY AND HARMONY
AND THERE ARE NO REDHEADED CLIENTS TO VEX US WITH THEIR CONUNDRUMS
MY FRIEND WAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC MUSICIAN BEING HIMSELF NOT ONLY A VERY
CAPABLE PERFORMER BUT A COMPOSER OF NO ORDINARY MERIT ALL THE
AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE STALLS WRAPPED IN THE MOST PERFECT HAPPINESS
GENTLY WAVING HIS LONG THIN FINGERS IN TIME TO THE MUSIC WHILE HIS
GENTLY SMILING FACE AND HIS LANGUID DREAMY EYES WERE AS UNLIKE THOSE
OF HOLMES THE SLEUTHHOUND HOLMES THE RELENTLESS KEENWITTED
READYHANDED CRIMINAL AGENT AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE IN HIS
SINGULAR CHARACTER THE DUAL NATURE ALTERNATELY ASSERTED ITSELF AND
HIS EXTREME EXACTNESS AND ASTUTENESS REPRESENTED AS I HAVE OFTEN
THOUGHT THE REACTION AGAINST THE POETIC AND CONTEMPLATIVE MOOD WHICH
OCCASIONALLY PREDOMINATED IN HIM THE SWING OF HIS NATURE TOOK HIM
FROM EXTREME LANGUOR TO DEVOURING ENERGY AND AS I KNEW WELL HE WAS
NEVER SO TRULY FORMIDABLE AS WHEN FOR DAYS ON END HE HAD BEEN
LOUNGING IN HIS ARMCHAIR AMID HIS IMPROVISATIONS AND HIS BLACKLETTER
EDITIONS THEN IT WAS THAT THE LUST OF THE CHASE WOULD SUDDENLY COME
UPON HIM AND THAT HIS BRILLIANT REASONING POWER WOULD RISE TO THE
LEVEL OF INTUITION UNTIL THOSE WHO WERE UNACQUAINTED WITH HIS
METHODS WOULD LOOK ASKANCE AT HIM AS ON A MAN WHOSE KNOWLEDGE WAS NOT
THAT OF OTHER MORTALS WHEN I SAW HIM THAT AFTERNOON SO ENWRAPPED IN
THE MUSIC AT ST JAMESS HALL I FELT THAT AN EVIL TIME MIGHT BE
COMING UPON THOSE WHOM HE HAD SET HIMSELF TO HUNT DOWN
YOU WANT TO GO HOME NO DOUBT DOCTOR HE REMARKED AS WE EMERGED
YES IT WOULD BE AS WELL
AND I HAVE SOME BUSINESS TO DO WHICH WILL TAKE SOME HOURS THIS
BUSINESS AT COBURG SQUARE IS SERIOUS
WHY SERIOUS
A CONSIDERABLE CRIME IS IN CONTEMPLATION I HAVE EVERY REASON TO
BELIEVE THAT WE SHALL BE IN TIME TO STOP IT BUT TODAY BEING
SATURDAY RATHER COMPLICATES MATTERS I SHALL WANT YOUR HELP
TONIGHT
AT WHAT TIME
TEN WILL BE EARLY ENOUGH
I SHALL BE AT BAKER STREET AT TEN
VERY WELL AND I SAY DOCTOR THERE MAY BE SOME LITTLE DANGER SO
KINDLY PUT YOUR ARMY REVOLVER IN YOUR POCKET HE WAVED HIS HAND
TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND DISAPPEARED IN AN INSTANT AMONG THE CROWD
I TRUST THAT I AM NOT MORE DENSE THAN MY NEIGHBOURS BUT I WAS ALWAYS
OPPRESSED WITH A SENSE OF MY OWN STUPIDITY IN MY DEALINGS WITH
SHERLOCK HOLMES HERE I HAD HEARD WHAT HE HAD HEARD I HAD SEEN WHAT
HE HAD SEEN AND YET FROM HIS WORDS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE SAW
CLEARLY NOT ONLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN
WHILE TO ME THE WHOLE BUSINESS WAS STILL CONFUSED AND GROTESQUE AS I
DROVE HOME TO MY HOUSE IN KENSINGTON I THOUGHT OVER IT ALL FROM THE
EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF THE REDHEADED COPIER OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA
DOWN TO THE VISIT TO SAXECOBURG SQUARE AND THE OMINOUS WORDS WITH
WHICH HE HAD PARTED FROM ME WHAT WAS THIS NOCTURNAL EXPEDITION AND
WHY SHOULD I GO ARMED WHERE WERE WE GOING AND WHAT WERE WE TO DO
I HAD THE HINT FROM HOLMES THAT THIS SMOOTHFACED PAWNBROKERS
ASSISTANT WAS A FORMIDABLE MANA MAN WHO MIGHT PLAY A DEEP GAME I
TRIED TO PUZZLE IT OUT BUT GAVE IT UP IN DESPAIR AND SET THE MATTER
ASIDE UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD BRING AN EXPLANATION
IT WAS A QUARTERPAST NINE WHEN I STARTED FROM HOME AND MADE MY WAY
ACROSS THE PARK AND SO THROUGH OXFORD STREET TO BAKER STREET TWO
HANSOMS WERE STANDING AT THE DOOR AND AS I ENTERED THE PASSAGE I
HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES FROM ABOVE ON ENTERING HIS ROOM I FOUND
HOLMES IN ANIMATED CONVERSATION WITH TWO MEN ONE OF WHOM I
RECOGNISED AS PETER JONES THE OFFICIAL POLICE AGENT WHILE THE OTHER
WAS A LONG THIN SADFACED MAN WITH A VERY SHINY HAT AND
OPPRESSIVELY RESPECTABLE FROCKCOAT
HA OUR PARTY IS COMPLETE SAID HOLMES BUTTONING UP HIS PEAJACKET
AND TAKING HIS HEAVY HUNTING CROP FROM THE RACK WATSON I THINK YOU
KNOW MR JONES OF SCOTLAND YARD LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO MR
MERRYWEATHER WHO IS TO BE OUR COMPANION IN TONIGHTS ADVENTURE
WERE HUNTING IN COUPLES AGAIN DOCTOR YOU SEE SAID JONES IN HIS
CONSEQUENTIAL WAY OUR FRIEND HERE IS A WONDERFUL MAN FOR STARTING A
CHASE ALL HE WANTS IS AN OLD DOG TO HELP HIM TO DO THE RUNNING
DOWN
I HOPE A WILD GOOSE MAY NOT PROVE TO BE THE END OF OUR CHASE
OBSERVED MR MERRYWEATHER GLOOMILY
YOU MAY PLACE CONSIDERABLE CONFIDENCE IN MR HOLMES SIR SAID THE
POLICE AGENT LOFTILY HE HAS HIS OWN LITTLE METHODS WHICH ARE IF
HE WONT MIND MY SAYING SO JUST A LITTLE TOO THEORETICAL AND
FANTASTIC BUT HE HAS THE MAKINGS OF A DETECTIVE IN HIM IT IS NOT
TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT ONCE OR TWICE AS IN THAT BUSINESS OF THE SHOLTO
MURDER AND THE AGRA TREASURE HE HAS BEEN MORE NEARLY CORRECT THAN
THE OFFICIAL FORCE
OH IF YOU SAY SO MR JONES IT IS ALL RIGHT SAID THE STRANGER
WITH DEFERENCE STILL I CONFESS THAT I MISS MY RUBBER IT IS THE
FIRST SATURDAY NIGHT FOR SEVENANDTWENTY YEARS THAT I HAVE NOT HAD
MY RUBBER
I THINK YOU WILL FIND SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES THAT YOU WILL PLAY
FOR A HIGHER STAKE TONIGHT THAN YOU HAVE EVER DONE YET AND THAT THE
PLAY WILL BE MORE EXCITING FOR YOU MR MERRYWEATHER THE STAKE WILL
BE SOME AND FOR YOU JONES IT WILL BE THE MAN UPON WHOM YOU
WISH TO LAY YOUR HANDS
JOHN CLAY THE MURDERER THIEF SMASHER AND FORGER HES A YOUNG
MAN MR MERRYWEATHER BUT HE IS AT THE HEAD OF HIS PROFESSION AND I
WOULD RATHER HAVE MY BRACELETS ON HIM THAN ON ANY CRIMINAL IN LONDON
HES A REMARKABLE MAN IS YOUNG JOHN CLAY HIS GRANDFATHER WAS A
ROYAL DUKE AND HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN TO ETON AND OXFORD HIS BRAIN IS
AS CUNNING AS HIS FINGERS AND THOUGH WE MEET SIGNS OF HIM AT EVERY
TURN WE NEVER KNOW WHERE TO FIND THE MAN HIMSELF HELL CRACK A CRIB
IN SCOTLAND ONE WEEK AND BE RAISING MONEY TO BUILD AN ORPHANAGE IN
CORNWALL THE NEXT IVE BEEN ON HIS TRACK FOR YEARS AND HAVE NEVER
SET EYES ON HIM YET
I HOPE THAT I MAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING YOU TONIGHT
IVE HAD ONE OR TWO LITTLE TURNS ALSO WITH MR JOHN CLAY AND I AGREE
WITH YOU THAT HE IS AT THE HEAD OF HIS PROFESSION IT IS PAST TEN
HOWEVER AND QUITE TIME THAT WE STARTED IF YOU TWO WILL TAKE THE
FIRST HANSOM WATSON AND I WILL FOLLOW IN THE SECOND
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS NOT VERY COMMUNICATIVE DURING THE LONG DRIVE AND
LAY BACK IN THE CAB HUMMING THE TUNES WHICH HE HAD HEARD IN THE
AFTERNOON WE RATTLED THROUGH AN ENDLESS LABYRINTH OF GASLIT STREETS
UNTIL WE EMERGED INTO FARRINGTON STREET
WE ARE CLOSE THERE NOW MY FRIEND REMARKED THIS FELLOW
MERRYWEATHER IS A BANK DIRECTOR AND PERSONALLY INTERESTED IN THE
MATTER I THOUGHT IT AS WELL TO HAVE JONES WITH US ALSO HE IS NOT A
BAD FELLOW THOUGH AN ABSOLUTE IMBECILE IN HIS PROFESSION HE HAS ONE
POSITIVE VIRTUE HE IS AS BRAVE AS A BULLDOG AND AS TENACIOUS AS A
LOBSTER IF HE GETS HIS CLAWS UPON ANYONE HERE WE ARE AND THEY ARE
WAITING FOR US
WE HAD REACHED THE SAME CROWDED THOROUGHFARE IN WHICH WE HAD FOUND
OURSELVES IN THE MORNING OUR CABS WERE DISMISSED AND FOLLOWING THE
GUIDANCE OF MR MERRYWEATHER WE PASSED DOWN A NARROW PASSAGE AND
THROUGH A SIDE DOOR WHICH HE OPENED FOR US WITHIN THERE WAS A SMALL
CORRIDOR WHICH ENDED IN A VERY MASSIVE IRON GATE THIS ALSO WAS
OPENED AND LED DOWN A FLIGHT OF WINDING STONE STEPS WHICH
TERMINATED AT ANOTHER FORMIDABLE GATE MR MERRYWEATHER STOPPED TO
LIGHT A LANTERN AND THEN CONDUCTED US DOWN A DARK EARTHSMELLING
PASSAGE AND SO AFTER OPENING A THIRD DOOR INTO A HUGE VAULT OR
CELLAR WHICH WAS PILED ALL ROUND WITH CRATES AND MASSIVE BOXES
YOU ARE NOT VERY VULNERABLE FROM ABOVE HOLMES REMARKED AS HE HELD
UP THE LANTERN AND GAZED ABOUT HIM
NOR FROM BELOW SAID MR MERRYWEATHER STRIKING HIS STICK UPON THE
FLAGS WHICH LINED THE FLOOR WHY DEAR ME IT SOUNDS QUITE HOLLOW
HE REMARKED LOOKING UP IN SURPRISE
I MUST REALLY ASK YOU TO BE A LITTLE MORE QUIET SAID HOLMES
SEVERELY YOU HAVE ALREADY IMPERILLED THE WHOLE SUCCESS OF OUR
EXPEDITION MIGHT I BEG THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SIT DOWN
UPON ONE OF THOSE BOXES AND NOT TO INTERFERE
THE SOLEMN MR MERRYWEATHER PERCHED HIMSELF UPON A CRATE WITH A VERY
INJURED EXPRESSION UPON HIS FACE WHILE HOLMES FELL UPON HIS KNEES
UPON THE FLOOR AND WITH THE LANTERN AND A MAGNIFYING LENS BEGAN TO
EXAMINE MINUTELY THE CRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES A FEW SECONDS
SUFFICED TO SATISFY HIM FOR HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND PUT HIS
GLASS IN HIS POCKET
WE HAVE AT LEAST AN HOUR BEFORE US HE REMARKED FOR THEY CAN
HARDLY TAKE ANY STEPS UNTIL THE GOOD PAWNBROKER IS SAFELY IN BED
THEN THEY WILL NOT LOSE A MINUTE FOR THE SOONER THEY DO THEIR WORK
THE LONGER TIME THEY WILL HAVE FOR THEIR ESCAPE WE ARE AT PRESENT
DOCTORAS NO DOUBT YOU HAVE DIVINEDIN THE CELLAR OF THE CITY
BRANCH OF ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL LONDON BANKS MR MERRYWEATHER IS THE
CHAIRMAN OF DIRECTORS AND HE WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT THERE ARE
REASONS WHY THE MORE DARING CRIMINALS OF LONDON SHOULD TAKE A
CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THIS CELLAR AT PRESENT
IT IS OUR FRENCH GOLD WHISPERED THE DIRECTOR WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL
WARNINGS THAT AN ATTEMPT MIGHT BE MADE UPON IT
YOUR FRENCH GOLD
YES WE HAD OCCASION SOME MONTHS AGO TO STRENGTHEN OUR RESOURCES AND
BORROWED FOR THAT PURPOSE NAPOLEONS FROM THE BANK OF FRANCE
IT HAS BECOME KNOWN THAT WE HAVE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO UNPACK THE
MONEY AND THAT IT IS STILL LYING IN OUR CELLAR THE CRATE UPON WHICH
I SIT CONTAINS NAPOLEONS PACKED BETWEEN LAYERS OF LEAD FOIL
OUR RESERVE OF BULLION IS MUCH LARGER AT PRESENT THAN IS USUALLY KEPT
IN A SINGLE BRANCH OFFICE AND THE DIRECTORS HAVE HAD MISGIVINGS UPON
THE SUBJECT
WHICH WERE VERY WELL JUSTIFIED OBSERVED HOLMES AND NOW IT IS
TIME THAT WE ARRANGED OUR LITTLE PLANS I EXPECT THAT WITHIN AN HOUR
MATTERS WILL COME TO A HEAD IN THE MEANTIME MR MERRYWEATHER WE
MUST PUT THE SCREEN OVER THAT DARK LANTERN
AND SIT IN THE DARK
I AM AFRAID SO I HAD BROUGHT A PACK OF CARDS IN MY POCKET AND I
THOUGHT THAT AS WE WERE A PARTIE CARRE YOU MIGHT HAVE YOUR RUBBER
AFTER ALL BUT I SEE THAT THE ENEMYS PREPARATIONS HAVE GONE SO FAR
THAT WE CANNOT RISK THE PRESENCE OF A LIGHT AND FIRST OF ALL WE
MUST CHOOSE OUR POSITIONS THESE ARE DARING MEN AND THOUGH WE SHALL
TAKE THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE THEY MAY DO US SOME HARM UNLESS WE ARE
CAREFUL I SHALL STAND BEHIND THIS CRATE AND DO YOU CONCEAL
YOURSELVES BEHIND THOSE THEN WHEN I FLASH A LIGHT UPON THEM CLOSE
IN SWIFTLY IF THEY FIRE WATSON HAVE NO COMPUNCTION ABOUT SHOOTING
THEM DOWN
I PLACED MY REVOLVER COCKED UPON THE TOP OF THE WOODEN CASE BEHIND
WHICH I CROUCHED HOLMES SHOT THE SLIDE ACROSS THE FRONT OF HIS
LANTERN AND LEFT US IN PITCH DARKNESSSUCH AN ABSOLUTE DARKNESS AS I
HAVE NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED THE SMELL OF HOT METAL REMAINED TO
ASSURE US THAT THE LIGHT WAS STILL THERE READY TO FLASH OUT AT A
MOMENTS NOTICE TO ME WITH MY NERVES WORKED UP TO A PITCH OF
EXPECTANCY THERE WAS SOMETHING DEPRESSING AND SUBDUING IN THE SUDDEN
GLOOM AND IN THE COLD DANK AIR OF THE VAULT
THEY HAVE BUT ONE RETREAT WHISPERED HOLMES THAT IS BACK THROUGH
THE HOUSE INTO SAXECOBURG SQUARE I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE DONE WHAT I
ASKED YOU JONES
I HAVE AN INSPECTOR AND TWO OFFICERS WAITING AT THE FRONT DOOR
THEN WE HAVE STOPPED ALL THE HOLES AND NOW WE MUST BE SILENT AND
WAIT
WHAT A TIME IT SEEMED FROM COMPARING NOTES AFTERWARDS IT WAS BUT AN
HOUR AND A QUARTER YET IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE NIGHT MUST HAVE
ALMOST GONE AND THE DAWN BE BREAKING ABOVE US MY LIMBS WERE WEARY
AND STIFF FOR I FEARED TO CHANGE MY POSITION YET MY NERVES WERE
WORKED UP TO THE HIGHEST PITCH OF TENSION AND MY HEARING WAS SO
ACUTE THAT I COULD NOT ONLY HEAR THE GENTLE BREATHING OF MY
COMPANIONS BUT I COULD DISTINGUISH THE DEEPER HEAVIER INBREATH OF
THE BULKY JONES FROM THE THIN SIGHING NOTE OF THE BANK DIRECTOR
FROM MY POSITION I COULD LOOK OVER THE CASE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
FLOOR SUDDENLY MY EYES CAUGHT THE GLINT OF A LIGHT
AT FIRST IT WAS BUT A LURID SPARK UPON THE STONE PAVEMENT THEN IT
LENGTHENED OUT UNTIL IT BECAME A YELLOW LINE AND THEN WITHOUT ANY
WARNING OR SOUND A GASH SEEMED TO OPEN AND A HAND APPEARED A WHITE
ALMOST WOMANLY HAND WHICH FELT ABOUT IN THE CENTRE OF THE LITTLE
AREA OF LIGHT FOR A MINUTE OR MORE THE HAND WITH ITS WRITHING
FINGERS PROTRUDED OUT OF THE FLOOR THEN IT WAS WITHDRAWN AS
SUDDENLY AS IT APPEARED AND ALL WAS DARK AGAIN SAVE THE SINGLE LURID
SPARK WHICH MARKED A CHINK BETWEEN THE STONES
ITS DISAPPEARANCE HOWEVER WAS BUT MOMENTARY WITH A RENDING
TEARING SOUND ONE OF THE BROAD WHITE STONES TURNED OVER UPON ITS
SIDE AND LEFT A SQUARE GAPING HOLE THROUGH WHICH STREAMED THE LIGHT
OF A LANTERN OVER THE EDGE THERE PEEPED A CLEANCUT BOYISH FACE
WHICH LOOKED KEENLY ABOUT IT AND THEN WITH A HAND ON EITHER SIDE OF
THE APERTURE DREW ITSELF SHOULDERHIGH AND WAISTHIGH UNTIL ONE
KNEE RESTED UPON THE EDGE IN ANOTHER INSTANT HE STOOD AT THE SIDE OF
THE HOLE AND WAS HAULING AFTER HIM A COMPANION LITHE AND SMALL LIKE
HIMSELF WITH A PALE FACE AND A SHOCK OF VERY RED HAIR
ITS ALL CLEAR HE WHISPERED HAVE YOU THE CHISEL AND THE BAGS
GREAT SCOTT JUMP ARCHIE JUMP AND ILL SWING FOR IT
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD SPRUNG OUT AND SEIZED THE INTRUDER BY THE COLLAR
THE OTHER DIVED DOWN THE HOLE AND I HEARD THE SOUND OF RENDING CLOTH
AS JONES CLUTCHED AT HIS SKIRTS THE LIGHT FLASHED UPON THE BARREL OF
A REVOLVER BUT HOLMES HUNTING CROP CAME DOWN ON THE MANS WRIST
AND THE PISTOL CLINKED UPON THE STONE FLOOR
ITS NO USE JOHN CLAY SAID HOLMES BLANDLY YOU HAVE NO CHANCE AT
ALL
SO I SEE THE OTHER ANSWERED WITH THE UTMOST COOLNESS I FANCY
THAT MY PAL IS ALL RIGHT THOUGH I SEE YOU HAVE GOT HIS COATTAILS
THERE ARE THREE MEN WAITING FOR HIM AT THE DOOR SAID HOLMES
OH INDEED YOU SEEM TO HAVE DONE THE THING VERY COMPLETELY I MUST
COMPLIMENT YOU
AND I YOU HOLMES ANSWERED YOUR REDHEADED IDEA WAS VERY NEW AND
EFFECTIVE
YOULL SEE YOUR PAL AGAIN PRESENTLY SAID JONES HES QUICKER AT
CLIMBING DOWN HOLES THAN I AM JUST HOLD OUT WHILE I FIX THE
DERBIES
I BEG THAT YOU WILL NOT TOUCH ME WITH YOUR FILTHY HANDS REMARKED
OUR PRISONER AS THE HANDCUFFS CLATTERED UPON HIS WRISTS YOU MAY NOT
BE AWARE THAT I HAVE ROYAL BLOOD IN MY VEINS HAVE THE GOODNESS
ALSO WHEN YOU ADDRESS ME ALWAYS TO SAY SIR AND PLEASE
ALL RIGHT SAID JONES WITH A STARE AND A SNIGGER WELL WOULD YOU
PLEASE SIR MARCH UPSTAIRS WHERE WE CAN GET A CAB TO CARRY YOUR
HIGHNESS TO THE POLICESTATION
THAT IS BETTER SAID JOHN CLAY SERENELY HE MADE A SWEEPING BOW TO
THE THREE OF US AND WALKED QUIETLY OFF IN THE CUSTODY OF THE
DETECTIVE
REALLY MR HOLMES SAID MR MERRYWEATHER AS WE FOLLOWED THEM FROM
THE CELLAR I DO NOT KNOW HOW THE BANK CAN THANK YOU OR REPAY YOU
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT YOU HAVE DETECTED AND DEFEATED IN THE MOST
COMPLETE MANNER ONE OF THE MOST DETERMINED ATTEMPTS AT BANK ROBBERY
THAT HAVE EVER COME WITHIN MY EXPERIENCE
I HAVE HAD ONE OR TWO LITTLE SCORES OF MY OWN TO SETTLE WITH MR
JOHN CLAY SAID HOLMES I HAVE BEEN AT SOME SMALL EXPENSE OVER THIS
MATTER WHICH I SHALL EXPECT THE BANK TO REFUND BUT BEYOND THAT I AM
AMPLY REPAID BY HAVING HAD AN EXPERIENCE WHICH IS IN MANY WAYS
UNIQUE AND BY HEARING THE VERY REMARKABLE NARRATIVE OF THE
REDHEADED LEAGUE
YOU SEE WATSON HE EXPLAINED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING AS
WE SAT OVER A GLASS OF WHISKY AND SODA IN BAKER STREET IT WAS
PERFECTLY OBVIOUS FROM THE FIRST THAT THE ONLY POSSIBLE OBJECT OF
THIS RATHER FANTASTIC BUSINESS OF THE ADVERTISEMENT OF THE LEAGUE
AND THE COPYING OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA MUST BE TO GET THIS NOT
OVERBRIGHT PAWNBROKER OUT OF THE WAY FOR A NUMBER OF HOURS EVERY
DAY IT WAS A CURIOUS WAY OF MANAGING IT BUT REALLY IT WOULD BE
DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A BETTER THE METHOD WAS NO DOUBT SUGGESTED TO
CLAYS INGENIOUS MIND BY THE COLOUR OF HIS ACCOMPLICES HAIR THE A WEEK
WAS A LURE WHICH MUST DRAW HIM AND WHAT WAS IT TO THEM WHO
WERE PLAYING FOR THOUSANDS THEY PUT IN THE ADVERTISEMENT ONE ROGUE
HAS THE TEMPORARY OFFICE THE OTHER ROGUE INCITES THE MAN TO APPLY
FOR IT AND TOGETHER THEY MANAGE TO SECURE HIS ABSENCE EVERY MORNING
IN THE WEEK FROM THE TIME THAT I HEARD OF THE ASSISTANT HAVING COME
FOR HALF WAGES IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT HE HAD SOME STRONG MOTIVE
FOR SECURING THE SITUATION
BUT HOW COULD YOU GUESS WHAT THE MOTIVE WAS
HAD THERE BEEN WOMEN IN THE HOUSE I SHOULD HAVE SUSPECTED A MERE
VULGAR INTRIGUE THAT HOWEVER WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION THE MANS
BUSINESS WAS A SMALL ONE AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS HOUSE WHICH
COULD ACCOUNT FOR SUCH ELABORATE PREPARATIONS AND SUCH AN
EXPENDITURE AS THEY WERE AT IT MUST THEN BE SOMETHING OUT OF THE
HOUSE WHAT COULD IT BE I THOUGHT OF THE ASSISTANTS FONDNESS FOR
PHOTOGRAPHY AND HIS TRICK OF VANISHING INTO THE CELLAR THE CELLAR
THERE WAS THE END OF THIS TANGLED CLUE THEN I MADE INQUIRIES AS TO
THIS MYSTERIOUS ASSISTANT AND FOUND THAT I HAD TO DEAL WITH ONE OF
THE COOLEST AND MOST DARING CRIMINALS IN LONDON HE WAS DOING
SOMETHING IN THE CELLARSOMETHING WHICH TOOK MANY HOURS A DAY FOR
MONTHS ON END WHAT COULD IT BE ONCE MORE I COULD THINK OF NOTHING
SAVE THAT HE WAS RUNNING A TUNNEL TO SOME OTHER BUILDING
SO FAR I HAD GOT WHEN WE WENT TO VISIT THE SCENE OF ACTION I
SURPRISED YOU BY BEATING UPON THE PAVEMENT WITH MY STICK I WAS
ASCERTAINING WHETHER THE CELLAR STRETCHED OUT IN FRONT OR BEHIND IT
WAS NOT IN FRONT THEN I RANG THE BELL AND AS I HOPED THE
ASSISTANT ANSWERED IT WE HAVE HAD SOME SKIRMISHES BUT WE HAD NEVER
SET EYES UPON EACH OTHER BEFORE I HARDLY LOOKED AT HIS FACE HIS
KNEES WERE WHAT I WISHED TO SEE YOU MUST YOURSELF HAVE REMARKED HOW
WORN WRINKLED AND STAINED THEY WERE THEY SPOKE OF THOSE HOURS OF
BURROWING THE ONLY REMAINING POINT WAS WHAT THEY WERE BURROWING FOR
I WALKED ROUND THE CORNER SAW THE CITY AND SUBURBAN BANK ABUTTED ON
OUR FRIENDS PREMISES AND FELT THAT I HAD SOLVED MY PROBLEM WHEN
YOU DROVE HOME AFTER THE CONCERT I CALLED UPON SCOTLAND YARD AND UPON
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BANK DIRECTORS WITH THE RESULT THAT YOU HAVE
SEEN
AND HOW COULD YOU TELL THAT THEY WOULD MAKE THEIR ATTEMPT TONIGHT
I ASKED
WELL WHEN THEY CLOSED THEIR LEAGUE OFFICES THAT WAS A SIGN THAT
THEY CARED NO LONGER ABOUT MR JABEZ WILSONS PRESENCEIN OTHER
WORDS THAT THEY HAD COMPLETED THEIR TUNNEL BUT IT WAS ESSENTIAL
THAT THEY SHOULD USE IT SOON AS IT MIGHT BE DISCOVERED OR THE
BULLION MIGHT BE REMOVED SATURDAY WOULD SUIT THEM BETTER THAN ANY
OTHER DAY AS IT WOULD GIVE THEM TWO DAYS FOR THEIR ESCAPE FOR ALL
THESE REASONS I EXPECTED THEM TO COME TONIGHT
YOU REASONED IT OUT BEAUTIFULLY I EXCLAIMED IN UNFEIGNED
ADMIRATION IT IS SO LONG A CHAIN AND YET EVERY LINK RINGS TRUE
IT SAVED ME FROM ENNUI HE ANSWERED YAWNING ALAS I ALREADY FEEL
IT CLOSING IN UPON ME MY LIFE IS SPENT IN ONE LONG EFFORT TO ESCAPE
FROM THE COMMONPLACES OF EXISTENCE THESE LITTLE PROBLEMS HELP ME TO
DO SO
AND YOU ARE A BENEFACTOR OF THE RACE SAID I
HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WELL PERHAPS AFTER ALL IT IS OF SOME
LITTLE USE HE REMARKED LHOMME CEST RIENLOEUVRE CEST TOUT
AS GUSTAVE FLAUBERT WROTE TO GEORGE SAND
A CASE OF IDENTITY
MY DEAR FELLOW SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES AS WE SAT ON EITHER SIDE OF
THE FIRE IN HIS LODGINGS AT BAKER STREET LIFE IS INFINITELY
STRANGER THAN ANYTHING WHICH THE MIND OF MAN COULD INVENT WE WOULD
NOT DARE TO CONCEIVE THE THINGS WHICH ARE REALLY MERE COMMONPLACES OF
EXISTENCE IF WE COULD FLY OUT OF THAT WINDOW HAND IN HAND HOVER
OVER THIS GREAT CITY GENTLY REMOVE THE ROOFS AND PEEP IN AT THE
QUEER THINGS WHICH ARE GOING ON THE STRANGE COINCIDENCES THE
PLANNINGS THE CROSSPURPOSES THE WONDERFUL CHAINS OF EVENTS
WORKING THROUGH GENERATIONS AND LEADING TO THE MOST OUTR RESULTS
IT WOULD MAKE ALL FICTION WITH ITS CONVENTIONALITIES AND FORESEEN
CONCLUSIONS MOST STALE AND UNPROFITABLE
AND YET I AM NOT CONVINCED OF IT I ANSWERED THE CASES WHICH COME
TO LIGHT IN THE PAPERS ARE AS A RULE BALD ENOUGH AND VULGAR
ENOUGH WE HAVE IN OUR POLICE REPORTS REALISM PUSHED TO ITS EXTREME
LIMITS AND YET THE RESULT IS IT MUST BE CONFESSED NEITHER
FASCINATING NOR ARTISTIC
A CERTAIN SELECTION AND DISCRETION MUST BE USED IN PRODUCING A
REALISTIC EFFECT REMARKED HOLMES THIS IS WANTING IN THE POLICE
REPORT WHERE MORE STRESS IS LAID PERHAPS UPON THE PLATITUDES OF
THE MAGISTRATE THAN UPON THE DETAILS WHICH TO AN OBSERVER CONTAIN
THE VITAL ESSENCE OF THE WHOLE MATTER DEPEND UPON IT THERE IS
NOTHING SO UNNATURAL AS THE COMMONPLACE
I SMILED AND SHOOK MY HEAD I CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND YOUR THINKING
SO I SAID OF COURSE IN YOUR POSITION OF UNOFFICIAL ADVISER AND
HELPER TO EVERYBODY WHO IS ABSOLUTELY PUZZLED THROUGHOUT THREE
CONTINENTS YOU ARE BROUGHT IN CONTACT WITH ALL THAT IS STRANGE AND
BIZARRE BUT HEREI PICKED UP THE MORNING PAPER FROM THE
GROUNDLET US PUT IT TO A PRACTICAL TEST HERE IS THE FIRST HEADING
UPON WHICH I COME A HUSBANDS CRUELTY TO HIS WIFE THERE IS HALF A
COLUMN OF PRINT BUT I KNOW WITHOUT READING IT THAT IT IS ALL
PERFECTLY FAMILIAR TO ME THERE IS OF COURSE THE OTHER WOMAN THE
DRINK THE PUSH THE BLOW THE BRUISE THE SYMPATHETIC SISTER OR
LANDLADY THE CRUDEST OF WRITERS COULD INVENT NOTHING MORE CRUDE
INDEED YOUR EXAMPLE IS AN UNFORTUNATE ONE FOR YOUR ARGUMENT SAID
HOLMES TAKING THE PAPER AND GLANCING HIS EYE DOWN IT THIS IS THE
DUNDAS SEPARATION CASE AND AS IT HAPPENS I WAS ENGAGED IN CLEARING
UP SOME SMALL POINTS IN CONNECTION WITH IT THE HUSBAND WAS A
TEETOTALER THERE WAS NO OTHER WOMAN AND THE CONDUCT COMPLAINED OF
WAS THAT HE HAD DRIFTED INTO THE HABIT OF WINDING UP EVERY MEAL BY
TAKING OUT HIS FALSE TEETH AND HURLING THEM AT HIS WIFE WHICH YOU
WILL ALLOW IS NOT AN ACTION LIKELY TO OCCUR TO THE IMAGINATION OF
THE AVERAGE STORYTELLER TAKE A PINCH OF SNUFF DOCTOR AND
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE SCORED OVER YOU IN YOUR EXAMPLE
HE HELD OUT HIS SNUFFBOX OF OLD GOLD WITH A GREAT AMETHYST IN THE
CENTRE OF THE LID ITS SPLENDOUR WAS IN SUCH CONTRAST TO HIS HOMELY
WAYS AND SIMPLE LIFE THAT I COULD NOT HELP COMMENTING UPON IT
AH SAID HE I FORGOT THAT I HAD NOT SEEN YOU FOR SOME WEEKS IT
IS A LITTLE SOUVENIR FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA IN RETURN FOR MY
ASSISTANCE IN THE CASE OF THE IRENE ADLER PAPERS
AND THE RING I ASKED GLANCING AT A REMARKABLE BRILLIANT WHICH
SPARKLED UPON HIS FINGER
IT WAS FROM THE REIGNING FAMILY OF HOLLAND THOUGH THE MATTER IN
WHICH I SERVED THEM WAS OF SUCH DELICACY THAT I CANNOT CONFIDE IT
EVEN TO YOU WHO HAVE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO CHRONICLE ONE OR TWO OF MY
LITTLE PROBLEMS
AND HAVE YOU ANY ON HAND JUST NOW I ASKED WITH INTEREST
SOME TEN OR TWELVE BUT NONE WHICH PRESENT ANY FEATURE OF INTEREST
THEY ARE IMPORTANT YOU UNDERSTAND WITHOUT BEING INTERESTING
INDEED I HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS USUALLY IN UNIMPORTANT MATTERS THAT
THERE IS A FIELD FOR THE OBSERVATION AND FOR THE QUICK ANALYSIS OF
CAUSE AND EFFECT WHICH GIVES THE CHARM TO AN INVESTIGATION THE
LARGER CRIMES ARE APT TO BE THE SIMPLER FOR THE BIGGER THE CRIME THE
MORE OBVIOUS AS A RULE IS THE MOTIVE IN THESE CASES SAVE FOR ONE
RATHER INTRICATE MATTER WHICH HAS BEEN REFERRED TO ME FROM
MARSEILLES THERE IS NOTHING WHICH PRESENTS ANY FEATURES OF INTEREST
IT IS POSSIBLE HOWEVER THAT I MAY HAVE SOMETHING BETTER BEFORE VERY
MANY MINUTES ARE OVER FOR THIS IS ONE OF MY CLIENTS OR I AM MUCH
MISTAKEN
HE HAD RISEN FROM HIS CHAIR AND WAS STANDING BETWEEN THE PARTED
BLINDS GAZING DOWN INTO THE DULL NEUTRALTINTED LONDON STREET
LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER I SAW THAT ON THE PAVEMENT OPPOSITE THERE
STOOD A LARGE WOMAN WITH A HEAVY FUR BOA ROUND HER NECK AND A LARGE
CURLING RED FEATHER IN A BROADBRIMMED HAT WHICH WAS TILTED IN A
COQUETTISH DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE FASHION OVER HER EAR FROM UNDER
THIS GREAT PANOPLY SHE PEEPED UP IN A NERVOUS HESITATING FASHION AT
OUR WINDOWS WHILE HER BODY OSCILLATED BACKWARD AND FORWARD AND HER
FINGERS FIDGETED WITH HER GLOVE BUTTONS SUDDENLY WITH A PLUNGE AS
OF THE SWIMMER WHO LEAVES THE BANK SHE HURRIED ACROSS THE ROAD AND
WE HEARD THE SHARP CLANG OF THE BELL
I HAVE SEEN THOSE SYMPTOMS BEFORE SAID HOLMES THROWING HIS
CIGARETTE INTO THE FIRE OSCILLATION UPON THE PAVEMENT ALWAYS MEANS
AN AFFAIRE DE COEUR SHE WOULD LIKE ADVICE BUT IS NOT SURE THAT THE
MATTER IS NOT TOO DELICATE FOR COMMUNICATION AND YET EVEN HERE WE
MAY DISCRIMINATE WHEN A WOMAN HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY WRONGED BY A MAN
SHE NO LONGER OSCILLATES AND THE USUAL SYMPTOM IS A BROKEN BELL
WIRE HERE WE MAY TAKE IT THAT THERE IS A LOVE MATTER BUT THAT THE
MAIDEN IS NOT SO MUCH ANGRY AS PERPLEXED OR GRIEVED BUT HERE SHE
COMES IN PERSON TO RESOLVE OUR DOUBTS
AS HE SPOKE THERE WAS A TAP AT THE DOOR AND THE BOY IN BUTTONS
ENTERED TO ANNOUNCE MISS MARY SUTHERLAND WHILE THE LADY HERSELF
LOOMED BEHIND HIS SMALL BLACK FIGURE LIKE A FULLSAILED MERCHANTMAN
BEHIND A TINY PILOT BOAT SHERLOCK HOLMES WELCOMED HER WITH THE EASY
COURTESY FOR WHICH HE WAS REMARKABLE AND HAVING CLOSED THE DOOR AND
BOWED HER INTO AN ARMCHAIR HE LOOKED HER OVER IN THE MINUTE AND YET
ABSTRACTED FASHION WHICH WAS PECULIAR TO HIM
DO YOU NOT FIND HE SAID THAT WITH YOUR SHORT SIGHT IT IS A
LITTLE TRYING TO DO SO MUCH TYPEWRITING
I DID AT FIRST SHE ANSWERED BUT NOW I KNOW WHERE THE LETTERS ARE
WITHOUT LOOKING THEN SUDDENLY REALISING THE FULL PURPORT OF HIS
WORDS SHE GAVE A VIOLENT START AND LOOKED UP WITH FEAR AND
ASTONISHMENT UPON HER BROAD GOODHUMOURED FACE YOUVE HEARD ABOUT
ME MR HOLMES SHE CRIED ELSE HOW COULD YOU KNOW ALL THAT
NEVER MIND SAID HOLMES LAUGHING IT IS MY BUSINESS TO KNOW
THINGS PERHAPS I HAVE TRAINED MYSELF TO SEE WHAT OTHERS OVERLOOK IF
NOT WHY SHOULD YOU COME TO CONSULT ME
I CAME TO YOU SIR BECAUSE I HEARD OF YOU FROM MRS ETHEREGE WHOSE
HUSBAND YOU FOUND SO EASY WHEN THE POLICE AND EVERYONE HAD GIVEN HIM
UP FOR DEAD OH MR HOLMES I WISH YOU WOULD DO AS MUCH FOR ME IM
NOT RICH BUT STILL I HAVE A HUNDRED A YEAR IN MY OWN RIGHT BESIDES
THE LITTLE THAT I MAKE BY THE MACHINE AND I WOULD GIVE IT ALL TO
KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF MR HOSMER ANGEL
WHY DID YOU COME AWAY TO CONSULT ME IN SUCH A HURRY ASKED SHERLOCK
HOLMES WITH HIS FINGERTIPS TOGETHER AND HIS EYES TO THE CEILING
AGAIN A STARTLED LOOK CAME OVER THE SOMEWHAT VACUOUS FACE OF MISS
MARY SUTHERLAND YES I DID BANG OUT OF THE HOUSE SHE SAID FOR
IT MADE ME ANGRY TO SEE THE EASY WAY IN WHICH MR WINDIBANKTHAT IS
MY FATHERTOOK IT ALL HE WOULD NOT GO TO THE POLICE AND HE WOULD
NOT GO TO YOU AND SO AT LAST AS HE WOULD DO NOTHING AND KEPT ON
SAYING THAT THERE WAS NO HARM DONE IT MADE ME MAD AND I JUST ON
WITH MY THINGS AND CAME RIGHT AWAY TO YOU
YOUR FATHER SAID HOLMES YOUR STEPFATHER SURELY SINCE THE NAME
IS DIFFERENT
YES MY STEPFATHER I CALL HIM FATHER THOUGH IT SOUNDS FUNNY TOO
FOR HE IS ONLY FIVE YEARS AND TWO MONTHS OLDER THAN MYSELF
AND YOUR MOTHER IS ALIVE
OH YES MOTHER IS ALIVE AND WELL I WASNT BEST PLEASED MR
HOLMES WHEN SHE MARRIED AGAIN SO SOON AFTER FATHERS DEATH AND A
MAN WHO WAS NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN HERSELF FATHER WAS A
PLUMBER IN THE TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD AND HE LEFT A TIDY BUSINESS
BEHIND HIM WHICH MOTHER CARRIED ON WITH MR HARDY THE FOREMAN BUT
WHEN MR WINDIBANK CAME HE MADE HER SELL THE BUSINESS FOR HE WAS
VERY SUPERIOR BEING A TRAVELLER IN WINES THEY GOT FOR THE
GOODWILL AND INTEREST WHICH WASNT NEAR AS MUCH AS FATHER COULD HAVE
GOT IF HE HAD BEEN ALIVE
I HAD EXPECTED TO SEE SHERLOCK HOLMES IMPATIENT UNDER THIS RAMBLING
AND INCONSEQUENTIAL NARRATIVE BUT ON THE CONTRARY HE HAD LISTENED
WITH THE GREATEST CONCENTRATION OF ATTENTION
YOUR OWN LITTLE INCOME HE ASKED DOES IT COME OUT OF THE
BUSINESS
OH NO SIR IT IS QUITE SEPARATE AND WAS LEFT ME BY MY UNCLE NED IN
AUCKLAND IT IS IN NEW ZEALAND STOCK PAYING PER CENT TWO
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS WAS THE AMOUNT BUT I CAN ONLY TOUCH THE
INTEREST
YOU INTEREST ME EXTREMELY SAID HOLMES AND SINCE YOU DRAW SO
LARGE A SUM AS A HUNDRED A YEAR WITH WHAT YOU EARN INTO THE BARGAIN
YOU NO DOUBT TRAVEL A LITTLE AND INDULGE YOURSELF IN EVERY WAY I
BELIEVE THAT A SINGLE LADY CAN GET ON VERY NICELY UPON AN INCOME OF
ABOUT I COULD DO WITH MUCH LESS THAN THAT MR HOLMES BUT YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT AS LONG AS I LIVE AT HOME I DONT WISH TO BE A BURDEN TO THEM
AND SO THEY HAVE THE USE OF THE MONEY JUST WHILE I AM STAYING WITH
THEM OF COURSE THAT IS ONLY JUST FOR THE TIME MR WINDIBANK DRAWS
MY INTEREST EVERY QUARTER AND PAYS IT OVER TO MOTHER AND I FIND THAT
I CAN DO PRETTY WELL WITH WHAT I EARN AT TYPEWRITING IT BRINGS ME
TWOPENCE A SHEET AND I CAN OFTEN DO FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SHEETS IN
A DAY
YOU HAVE MADE YOUR POSITION VERY CLEAR TO ME SAID HOLMES THIS IS
MY FRIEND DR WATSON BEFORE WHOM YOU CAN SPEAK AS FREELY AS BEFORE
MYSELF KINDLY TELL US NOW ALL ABOUT YOUR CONNECTION WITH MR HOSMER
ANGEL
A FLUSH STOLE OVER MISS SUTHERLANDS FACE AND SHE PICKED NERVOUSLY
AT THE FRINGE OF HER JACKET I MET HIM FIRST AT THE GASFITTERS
BALL SHE SAID THEY USED TO SEND FATHER TICKETS WHEN HE WAS ALIVE
AND THEN AFTERWARDS THEY REMEMBERED US AND SENT THEM TO MOTHER MR
WINDIBANK DID NOT WISH US TO GO HE NEVER DID WISH US TO GO ANYWHERE
HE WOULD GET QUITE MAD IF I WANTED SO MUCH AS TO JOIN A SUNDAYSCHOOL
TREAT BUT THIS TIME I WAS SET ON GOING AND I WOULD GO FOR WHAT
RIGHT HAD HE TO PREVENT HE SAID THE FOLK WERE NOT FIT FOR US TO
KNOW WHEN ALL FATHERS FRIENDS WERE TO BE THERE AND HE SAID THAT I
HAD NOTHING FIT TO WEAR WHEN I HAD MY PURPLE PLUSH THAT I HAD NEVER
SO MUCH AS TAKEN OUT OF THE DRAWER AT LAST WHEN NOTHING ELSE WOULD
DO HE WENT OFF TO FRANCE UPON THE BUSINESS OF THE FIRM BUT WE WENT
MOTHER AND I WITH MR HARDY WHO USED TO BE OUR FOREMAN AND IT WAS
THERE I MET MR HOSMER ANGEL
I SUPPOSE SAID HOLMES THAT WHEN MR WINDIBANK CAME BACK FROM
FRANCE HE WAS VERY ANNOYED AT YOUR HAVING GONE TO THE BALL
OH WELL HE WAS VERY GOOD ABOUT IT HE LAUGHED I REMEMBER AND
SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID THERE WAS NO USE DENYING ANYTHING TO
A WOMAN FOR SHE WOULD HAVE HER WAY
I SEE THEN AT THE GASFITTERS BALL YOU MET AS I UNDERSTAND A
GENTLEMAN CALLED MR HOSMER ANGEL
YES SIR I MET HIM THAT NIGHT AND HE CALLED NEXT DAY TO ASK IF WE
HAD GOT HOME ALL SAFE AND AFTER THAT WE MET HIMTHAT IS TO SAY MR
HOLMES I MET HIM TWICE FOR WALKS BUT AFTER THAT FATHER CAME BACK
AGAIN AND MR HOSMER ANGEL COULD NOT COME TO THE HOUSE ANY MORE
NO
WELL YOU KNOW FATHER DIDNT LIKE ANYTHING OF THE SORT HE WOULDNT
HAVE ANY VISITORS IF HE COULD HELP IT AND HE USED TO SAY THAT A
WOMAN SHOULD BE HAPPY IN HER OWN FAMILY CIRCLE BUT THEN AS I USED
TO SAY TO MOTHER A WOMAN WANTS HER OWN CIRCLE TO BEGIN WITH AND I
HAD NOT GOT MINE YET
BUT HOW ABOUT MR HOSMER ANGEL DID HE MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE YOU
WELL FATHER WAS GOING OFF TO FRANCE AGAIN IN A WEEK AND HOSMER
WROTE AND SAID THAT IT WOULD BE SAFER AND BETTER NOT TO SEE EACH
OTHER UNTIL HE HAD GONE WE COULD WRITE IN THE MEANTIME AND HE USED
TO WRITE EVERY DAY I TOOK THE LETTERS IN IN THE MORNING SO THERE
WAS NO NEED FOR FATHER TO KNOW
WERE YOU ENGAGED TO THE GENTLEMAN AT THIS TIME
OH YES MR HOLMES WE WERE ENGAGED AFTER THE FIRST WALK THAT WE
TOOK HOSMERMR ANGELWAS A CASHIER IN AN OFFICE IN LEADENHALL
STREETAND
WHAT OFFICE
THATS THE WORST OF IT MR HOLMES I DONT KNOW
WHERE DID HE LIVE THEN
HE SLEPT ON THE PREMISES
AND YOU DONT KNOW HIS ADDRESS
NOEXCEPT THAT IT WAS LEADENHALL STREET
WHERE DID YOU ADDRESS YOUR LETTERS THEN
TO THE LEADENHALL STREET POST OFFICE TO BE LEFT TILL CALLED FOR HE
SAID THAT IF THEY WERE SENT TO THE OFFICE HE WOULD BE CHAFFED BY ALL
THE OTHER CLERKS ABOUT HAVING LETTERS FROM A LADY SO I OFFERED TO
TYPEWRITE THEM LIKE HE DID HIS BUT HE WOULDNT HAVE THAT FOR HE
SAID THAT WHEN I WROTE THEM THEY SEEMED TO COME FROM ME BUT WHEN
THEY WERE TYPEWRITTEN HE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE MACHINE HAD COME
BETWEEN US THAT WILL JUST SHOW YOU HOW FOND HE WAS OF ME MR
HOLMES AND THE LITTLE THINGS THAT HE WOULD THINK OF
IT WAS MOST SUGGESTIVE SAID HOLMES IT HAS LONG BEEN AN AXIOM OF
MINE THAT THE LITTLE THINGS ARE INFINITELY THE MOST IMPORTANT CAN
YOU REMEMBER ANY OTHER LITTLE THINGS ABOUT MR HOSMER ANGEL
HE WAS A VERY SHY MAN MR HOLMES HE WOULD RATHER WALK WITH ME IN
THE EVENING THAN IN THE DAYLIGHT FOR HE SAID THAT HE HATED TO BE
CONSPICUOUS VERY RETIRING AND GENTLEMANLY HE WAS EVEN HIS VOICE WAS
GENTLE HED HAD THE QUINSY AND SWOLLEN GLANDS WHEN HE WAS YOUNG HE
TOLD ME AND IT HAD LEFT HIM WITH A WEAK THROAT AND A HESITATING
WHISPERING FASHION OF SPEECH HE WAS ALWAYS WELL DRESSED VERY NEAT
AND PLAIN BUT HIS EYES WERE WEAK JUST AS MINE ARE AND HE WORE
TINTED GLASSES AGAINST THE GLARE
WELL AND WHAT HAPPENED WHEN MR WINDIBANK YOUR STEPFATHER
RETURNED TO FRANCE
MR HOSMER ANGEL CAME TO THE HOUSE AGAIN AND PROPOSED THAT WE SHOULD
MARRY BEFORE FATHER CAME BACK HE WAS IN DREADFUL EARNEST AND MADE ME
SWEAR WITH MY HANDS ON THE TESTAMENT THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED I WOULD
ALWAYS BE TRUE TO HIM MOTHER SAID HE WAS QUITE RIGHT TO MAKE ME
SWEAR AND THAT IT WAS A SIGN OF HIS PASSION MOTHER WAS ALL IN HIS
FAVOUR FROM THE FIRST AND WAS EVEN FONDER OF HIM THAN I WAS THEN
WHEN THEY TALKED OF MARRYING WITHIN THE WEEK I BEGAN TO ASK ABOUT
FATHER BUT THEY BOTH SAID NEVER TO MIND ABOUT FATHER BUT JUST TO
TELL HIM AFTERWARDS AND MOTHER SAID SHE WOULD MAKE IT ALL RIGHT WITH
HIM I DIDNT QUITE LIKE THAT MR HOLMES IT SEEMED FUNNY THAT I
SHOULD ASK HIS LEAVE AS HE WAS ONLY A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN ME BUT I
DIDNT WANT TO DO ANYTHING ON THE SLY SO I WROTE TO FATHER AT
BORDEAUX WHERE THE COMPANY HAS ITS FRENCH OFFICES BUT THE LETTER
CAME BACK TO ME ON THE VERY MORNING OF THE WEDDING
IT MISSED HIM THEN
YES SIR FOR HE HAD STARTED TO ENGLAND JUST BEFORE IT ARRIVED
HA THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE YOUR WEDDING WAS ARRANGED THEN FOR THE
FRIDAY WAS IT TO BE IN CHURCH
YES SIR BUT VERY QUIETLY IT WAS TO BE AT ST SAVIOURS NEAR
KINGS CROSS AND WE WERE TO HAVE BREAKFAST AFTERWARDS AT THE ST
PANCRAS HOTEL HOSMER CAME FOR US IN A HANSOM BUT AS THERE WERE TWO
OF US HE PUT US BOTH INTO IT AND STEPPED HIMSELF INTO A FOURWHEELER
WHICH HAPPENED TO BE THE ONLY OTHER CAB IN THE STREET WE GOT TO THE
CHURCH FIRST AND WHEN THE FOURWHEELER DROVE UP WE WAITED FOR HIM TO
STEP OUT BUT HE NEVER DID AND WHEN THE CABMAN GOT DOWN FROM THE BOX
AND LOOKED THERE WAS NO ONE THERE THE CABMAN SAID THAT HE COULD NOT
IMAGINE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM FOR HE HAD SEEN HIM GET IN WITH HIS
OWN EYES THAT WAS LAST FRIDAY MR HOLMES AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR
HEARD ANYTHING SINCE THEN TO THROW ANY LIGHT UPON WHAT BECAME OF
HIM
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU HAVE BEEN VERY SHAMEFULLY TREATED SAID
HOLMES
OH NO SIR HE WAS TOO GOOD AND KIND TO LEAVE ME SO WHY ALL THE
MORNING HE WAS SAYING TO ME THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED I WAS TO BE
TRUE AND THAT EVEN IF SOMETHING QUITE UNFORESEEN OCCURRED TO
SEPARATE US I WAS ALWAYS TO REMEMBER THAT I WAS PLEDGED TO HIM AND
THAT HE WOULD CLAIM HIS PLEDGE SOONER OR LATER IT SEEMED STRANGE
TALK FOR A WEDDINGMORNING BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE GIVES A
MEANING TO IT
MOST CERTAINLY IT DOES YOUR OWN OPINION IS THEN THAT SOME
UNFORESEEN CATASTROPHE HAS OCCURRED TO HIM
YES SIR I BELIEVE THAT HE FORESAW SOME DANGER OR ELSE HE WOULD
NOT HAVE TALKED SO AND THEN I THINK THAT WHAT HE FORESAW HAPPENED
BUT YOU HAVE NO NOTION AS TO WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN
NONE
ONE MORE QUESTION HOW DID YOUR MOTHER TAKE THE MATTER
SHE WAS ANGRY AND SAID THAT I WAS NEVER TO SPEAK OF THE MATTER
AGAIN
AND YOUR FATHER DID YOU TELL HIM
YES AND HE SEEMED TO THINK WITH ME THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED
AND THAT I SHOULD HEAR OF HOSMER AGAIN AS HE SAID WHAT INTEREST
COULD ANYONE HAVE IN BRINGING ME TO THE DOORS OF THE CHURCH AND THEN
LEAVING ME NOW IF HE HAD BORROWED MY MONEY OR IF HE HAD MARRIED ME
AND GOT MY MONEY SETTLED ON HIM THERE MIGHT BE SOME REASON BUT
HOSMER WAS VERY INDEPENDENT ABOUT MONEY AND NEVER WOULD LOOK AT A
SHILLING OF MINE AND YET WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED AND WHY COULD HE
NOT WRITE OH IT DRIVES ME HALFMAD TO THINK OF IT AND I CANT
SLEEP A WINK AT NIGHT SHE PULLED A LITTLE HANDKERCHIEF OUT OF HER
MUFF AND BEGAN TO SOB HEAVILY INTO IT
I SHALL GLANCE INTO THE CASE FOR YOU SAID HOLMES RISING AND I
HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE SHALL REACH SOME DEFINITE RESULT LET THE
WEIGHT OF THE MATTER REST UPON ME NOW AND DO NOT LET YOUR MIND DWELL
UPON IT FURTHER ABOVE ALL TRY TO LET MR HOSMER ANGEL VANISH FROM
YOUR MEMORY AS HE HAS DONE FROM YOUR LIFE
THEN YOU DONT THINK ILL SEE HIM AGAIN
I FEAR NOT
THEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO HIM
YOU WILL LEAVE THAT QUESTION IN MY HANDS I SHOULD LIKE AN ACCURATE
DESCRIPTION OF HIM AND ANY LETTERS OF HIS WHICH YOU CAN SPARE
I ADVERTISED FOR HIM IN LAST SATURDAYS CHRONICLE SAID SHE HERE
IS THE SLIP AND HERE ARE FOUR LETTERS FROM HIM
THANK YOU AND YOUR ADDRESS
NO LYON PLACE CAMBERWELL
MR ANGELS ADDRESS YOU NEVER HAD I UNDERSTAND WHERE IS YOUR
FATHERS PLACE OF BUSINESS
HE TRAVELS FOR WESTHOUSE MARBANK THE GREAT CLARET IMPORTERS OF
FENCHURCH STREET
THANK YOU YOU HAVE MADE YOUR STATEMENT VERY CLEARLY YOU WILL LEAVE
THE PAPERS HERE AND REMEMBER THE ADVICE WHICH I HAVE GIVEN YOU LET
THE WHOLE INCIDENT BE A SEALED BOOK AND DO NOT ALLOW IT TO AFFECT
YOUR LIFE
YOU ARE VERY KIND MR HOLMES BUT I CANNOT DO THAT I SHALL BE TRUE
TO HOSMER HE SHALL FIND ME READY WHEN HE COMES BACK
FOR ALL THE PREPOSTEROUS HAT AND THE VACUOUS FACE THERE WAS
SOMETHING NOBLE IN THE SIMPLE FAITH OF OUR VISITOR WHICH COMPELLED
OUR RESPECT SHE LAID HER LITTLE BUNDLE OF PAPERS UPON THE TABLE AND
WENT HER WAY WITH A PROMISE TO COME AGAIN WHENEVER SHE MIGHT BE
SUMMONED
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT SILENT FOR A FEW MINUTES WITH HIS FINGERTIPS
STILL PRESSED TOGETHER HIS LEGS STRETCHED OUT IN FRONT OF HIM AND
HIS GAZE DIRECTED UPWARD TO THE CEILING THEN HE TOOK DOWN FROM THE
RACK THE OLD AND OILY CLAY PIPE WHICH WAS TO HIM AS A COUNSELLOR
AND HAVING LIT IT HE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH THE THICK BLUE
CLOUDWREATHS SPINNING UP FROM HIM AND A LOOK OF INFINITE LANGUOR IN
HIS FACE
QUITE AN INTERESTING STUDY THAT MAIDEN HE OBSERVED I FOUND HER
MORE INTERESTING THAN HER LITTLE PROBLEM WHICH BY THE WAY IS
RATHER A TRITE ONE YOU WILL FIND PARALLEL CASES IF YOU CONSULT MY
INDEX IN ANDOVER IN AND THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THE SORT AT THE
HAGUE LAST YEAR OLD AS IS THE IDEA HOWEVER THERE WERE ONE OR TWO
DETAILS WHICH WERE NEW TO ME BUT THE MAIDEN HERSELF WAS MOST
INSTRUCTIVE
YOU APPEARED TO READ A GOOD DEAL UPON HER WHICH WAS QUITE INVISIBLE
TO ME I REMARKED
NOT INVISIBLE BUT UNNOTICED WATSON YOU DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO LOOK
AND SO YOU MISSED ALL THAT WAS IMPORTANT I CAN NEVER BRING YOU TO
REALISE THE IMPORTANCE OF SLEEVES THE SUGGESTIVENESS OF THUMBNAILS
OR THE GREAT ISSUES THAT MAY HANG FROM A BOOTLACE NOW WHAT DID YOU
GATHER FROM THAT WOMANS APPEARANCE DESCRIBE IT
WELL SHE HAD A SLATECOLOURED BROADBRIMMED STRAW HAT WITH A
FEATHER OF A BRICKISH RED HER JACKET WAS BLACK WITH BLACK BEADS
SEWN UPON IT AND A FRINGE OF LITTLE BLACK JET ORNAMENTS HER DRESS
WAS BROWN RATHER DARKER THAN COFFEE COLOUR WITH A LITTLE PURPLE
PLUSH AT THE NECK AND SLEEVES HER GLOVES WERE GREYISH AND WERE WORN
THROUGH AT THE RIGHT FOREFINGER HER BOOTS I DIDNT OBSERVE SHE HAD
SMALL ROUND HANGING GOLD EARRINGS AND A GENERAL AIR OF BEING FAIRLY
WELLTODO IN A VULGAR COMFORTABLE EASYGOING WAY
SHERLOCK HOLMES CLAPPED HIS HANDS SOFTLY TOGETHER AND CHUCKLED
PON MY WORD WATSON YOU ARE COMING ALONG WONDERFULLY YOU HAVE
REALLY DONE VERY WELL INDEED IT IS TRUE THAT YOU HAVE MISSED
EVERYTHING OF IMPORTANCE BUT YOU HAVE HIT UPON THE METHOD AND YOU
HAVE A QUICK EYE FOR COLOUR NEVER TRUST TO GENERAL IMPRESSIONS MY
BOY BUT CONCENTRATE YOURSELF UPON DETAILS MY FIRST GLANCE IS ALWAYS
AT A WOMANS SLEEVE IN A MAN IT IS PERHAPS BETTER FIRST TO TAKE THE
KNEE OF THE TROUSER AS YOU OBSERVE THIS WOMAN HAD PLUSH UPON HER
SLEEVES WHICH IS A MOST USEFUL MATERIAL FOR SHOWING TRACES THE
DOUBLE LINE A LITTLE ABOVE THE WRIST WHERE THE TYPEWRITIST PRESSES
AGAINST THE TABLE WAS BEAUTIFULLY DEFINED THE SEWINGMACHINE OF
THE HAND TYPE LEAVES A SIMILAR MARK BUT ONLY ON THE LEFT ARM AND
ON THE SIDE OF IT FARTHEST FROM THE THUMB INSTEAD OF BEING RIGHT
ACROSS THE BROADEST PART AS THIS WAS I THEN GLANCED AT HER FACE
AND OBSERVING THE DINT OF A PINCENEZ AT EITHER SIDE OF HER NOSE I
VENTURED A REMARK UPON SHORT SIGHT AND TYPEWRITING WHICH SEEMED TO
SURPRISE HER
IT SURPRISED ME
BUT SURELY IT WAS OBVIOUS I WAS THEN MUCH SURPRISED AND
INTERESTED ON GLANCING DOWN TO OBSERVE THAT THOUGH THE BOOTS WHICH
SHE WAS WEARING WERE NOT UNLIKE EACH OTHER THEY WERE REALLY ODD
ONES THE ONE HAVING A SLIGHTLY DECORATED TOECAP AND THE OTHER A
PLAIN ONE ONE WAS BUTTONED ONLY IN THE TWO LOWER BUTTONS OUT OF
FIVE AND THE OTHER AT THE FIRST THIRD AND FIFTH NOW WHEN YOU SEE
THAT A YOUNG LADY OTHERWISE NEATLY DRESSED HAS COME AWAY FROM HOME
WITH ODD BOOTS HALFBUTTONED IT IS NO GREAT DEDUCTION TO SAY THAT
SHE CAME AWAY IN A HURRY
AND WHAT ELSE I ASKED KEENLY INTERESTED AS I ALWAYS WAS BY MY
FRIENDS INCISIVE REASONING
I NOTED IN PASSING THAT SHE HAD WRITTEN A NOTE BEFORE LEAVING HOME
BUT AFTER BEING FULLY DRESSED YOU OBSERVED THAT HER RIGHT GLOVE WAS
TORN AT THE FOREFINGER BUT YOU DID NOT APPARENTLY SEE THAT BOTH
GLOVE AND FINGER WERE STAINED WITH VIOLET INK SHE HAD WRITTEN IN A
HURRY AND DIPPED HER PEN TOO DEEP IT MUST HAVE BEEN THIS MORNING OR
THE MARK WOULD NOT REMAIN CLEAR UPON THE FINGER ALL THIS IS AMUSING
THOUGH RATHER ELEMENTARY BUT I MUST GO BACK TO BUSINESS WATSON
WOULD YOU MIND READING ME THE ADVERTISED DESCRIPTION OF MR HOSMER
ANGEL
I HELD THE LITTLE PRINTED SLIP TO THE LIGHT
MISSING IT SAID ON THE MORNING OF THE FOURTEENTH A GENTLEMAN
NAMED HOSMER ANGEL ABOUT FIVE FT SEVEN IN IN HEIGHT STRONGLY
BUILT SALLOW COMPLEXION BLACK HAIR A LITTLE BALD IN THE CENTRE
BUSHY BLACK SIDEWHISKERS AND MOUSTACHE TINTED GLASSES SLIGHT
INFIRMITY OF SPEECH WAS DRESSED WHEN LAST SEEN IN BLACK FROCKCOAT
FACED WITH SILK BLACK WAISTCOAT GOLD ALBERT CHAIN AND GREY HARRIS
TWEED TROUSERS WITH BROWN GAITERS OVER ELASTICSIDED BOOTS KNOWN TO
HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED IN AN OFFICE IN LEADENHALL STREET ANYBODY
BRINGING
THAT WILL DO SAID HOLMES AS TO THE LETTERS HE CONTINUED
GLANCING OVER THEM THEY ARE VERY COMMONPLACE ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE IN
THEM TO MR ANGEL SAVE THAT HE QUOTES BALZAC ONCE THERE IS ONE
REMARKABLE POINT HOWEVER WHICH WILL NO DOUBT STRIKE YOU
THEY ARE TYPEWRITTEN I REMARKED
NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE SIGNATURE IS TYPEWRITTEN LOOK AT THE NEAT
LITTLE HOSMER ANGEL AT THE BOTTOM THERE IS A DATE YOU SEE BUT NO
SUPERSCRIPTION EXCEPT LEADENHALL STREET WHICH IS RATHER VAGUE THE
POINT ABOUT THE SIGNATURE IS VERY SUGGESTIVEIN FACT WE MAY CALL IT
CONCLUSIVE
OF WHAT
MY DEAR FELLOW IS IT POSSIBLE YOU DO NOT SEE HOW STRONGLY IT BEARS
UPON THE CASE
I CANNOT SAY THAT I DO UNLESS IT WERE THAT HE WISHED TO BE ABLE TO
DENY HIS SIGNATURE IF AN ACTION FOR BREACH OF PROMISE WERE
INSTITUTED
NO THAT WAS NOT THE POINT HOWEVER I SHALL WRITE TWO LETTERS
WHICH SHOULD SETTLE THE MATTER ONE IS TO A FIRM IN THE CITY THE
OTHER IS TO THE YOUNG LADYS STEPFATHER MR WINDIBANK ASKING HIM
WHETHER HE COULD MEET US HERE AT SIX OCLOCK TOMORROW EVENING IT IS
JUST AS WELL THAT WE SHOULD DO BUSINESS WITH THE MALE RELATIVES AND
NOW DOCTOR WE CAN DO NOTHING UNTIL THE ANSWERS TO THOSE LETTERS
COME SO WE MAY PUT OUR LITTLE PROBLEM UPON THE SHELF FOR THE
INTERIM
I HAD HAD SO MANY REASONS TO BELIEVE IN MY FRIENDS SUBTLE POWERS OF
REASONING AND EXTRAORDINARY ENERGY IN ACTION THAT I FELT THAT HE MUST
HAVE SOME SOLID GROUNDS FOR THE ASSURED AND EASY DEMEANOUR WITH WHICH
HE TREATED THE SINGULAR MYSTERY WHICH HE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO
FATHOM ONCE ONLY HAD I KNOWN HIM TO FAIL IN THE CASE OF THE KING OF
BOHEMIA AND OF THE IRENE ADLER PHOTOGRAPH BUT WHEN I LOOKED BACK TO
THE WEIRD BUSINESS OF THE SIGN OF FOUR AND THE EXTRAORDINARY
CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE STUDY IN SCARLET I FELT THAT IT
WOULD BE A STRANGE TANGLE INDEED WHICH HE COULD NOT UNRAVEL
I LEFT HIM THEN STILL PUFFING AT HIS BLACK CLAY PIPE WITH THE
CONVICTION THAT WHEN I CAME AGAIN ON THE NEXT EVENING I WOULD FIND
THAT HE HELD IN HIS HANDS ALL THE CLUES WHICH WOULD LEAD UP TO THE
IDENTITY OF THE DISAPPEARING BRIDEGROOM OF MISS MARY SUTHERLAND
A PROFESSIONAL CASE OF GREAT GRAVITY WAS ENGAGING MY OWN ATTENTION AT
THE TIME AND THE WHOLE OF NEXT DAY I WAS BUSY AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE
SUFFERER IT WAS NOT UNTIL CLOSE UPON SIX OCLOCK THAT I FOUND MYSELF
FREE AND WAS ABLE TO SPRING INTO A HANSOM AND DRIVE TO BAKER STREET
HALF AFRAID THAT I MIGHT BE TOO LATE TO ASSIST AT THE DNOUEMENT OF
THE LITTLE MYSTERY I FOUND SHERLOCK HOLMES ALONE HOWEVER HALF
ASLEEP WITH HIS LONG THIN FORM CURLED UP IN THE RECESSES OF HIS
ARMCHAIR A FORMIDABLE ARRAY OF BOTTLES AND TESTTUBES WITH THE
PUNGENT CLEANLY SMELL OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID TOLD ME THAT HE HAD SPENT
HIS DAY IN THE CHEMICAL WORK WHICH WAS SO DEAR TO HIM
WELL HAVE YOU SOLVED IT I ASKED AS I ENTERED
YES IT WAS THE BISULPHATE OF BARYTA
NO NO THE MYSTERY I CRIED
OH THAT I THOUGHT OF THE SALT THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING UPON THERE
WAS NEVER ANY MYSTERY IN THE MATTER THOUGH AS I SAID YESTERDAY
SOME OF THE DETAILS ARE OF INTEREST THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS THAT THERE
IS NO LAW I FEAR THAT CAN TOUCH THE SCOUNDREL
WHO WAS HE THEN AND WHAT WAS HIS OBJECT IN DESERTING MISS
SUTHERLAND
THE QUESTION WAS HARDLY OUT OF MY MOUTH AND HOLMES HAD NOT YET
OPENED HIS LIPS TO REPLY WHEN WE HEARD A HEAVY FOOTFALL IN THE
PASSAGE AND A TAP AT THE DOOR
THIS IS THE GIRLS STEPFATHER MR JAMES WINDIBANK SAID HOLMES
HE HAS WRITTEN TO ME TO SAY THAT HE WOULD BE HERE AT SIX COME IN
THE MAN WHO ENTERED WAS A STURDY MIDDLESIZED FELLOW SOME THIRTY
YEARS OF AGE CLEANSHAVEN AND SALLOWSKINNED WITH A BLAND
INSINUATING MANNER AND A PAIR OF WONDERFULLY SHARP AND PENETRATING
GREY EYES HE SHOT A QUESTIONING GLANCE AT EACH OF US PLACED HIS
SHINY TOPHAT UPON THE SIDEBOARD AND WITH A SLIGHT BOW SIDLED DOWN
INTO THE NEAREST CHAIR
GOODEVENING MR JAMES WINDIBANK SAID HOLMES I THINK THAT THIS
TYPEWRITTEN LETTER IS FROM YOU IN WHICH YOU MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH
ME FOR SIX OCLOCK
YES SIR I AM AFRAID THAT I AM A LITTLE LATE BUT I AM NOT QUITE MY
OWN MASTER YOU KNOW I AM SORRY THAT MISS SUTHERLAND HAS TROUBLED
YOU ABOUT THIS LITTLE MATTER FOR I THINK IT IS FAR BETTER NOT TO
WASH LINEN OF THE SORT IN PUBLIC IT WAS QUITE AGAINST MY WISHES THAT
SHE CAME BUT SHE IS A VERY EXCITABLE IMPULSIVE GIRL AS YOU MAY
HAVE NOTICED AND SHE IS NOT EASILY CONTROLLED WHEN SHE HAS MADE UP
HER MIND ON A POINT OF COURSE I DID NOT MIND YOU SO MUCH AS YOU
ARE NOT CONNECTED WITH THE OFFICIAL POLICE BUT IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO
HAVE A FAMILY MISFORTUNE LIKE THIS NOISED ABROAD BESIDES IT IS A
USELESS EXPENSE FOR HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY FIND THIS HOSMER ANGEL
ON THE CONTRARY SAID HOLMES QUIETLY I HAVE EVERY REASON TO
BELIEVE THAT I WILL SUCCEED IN DISCOVERING MR HOSMER ANGEL
MR WINDIBANK GAVE A VIOLENT START AND DROPPED HIS GLOVES I AM
DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT HE SAID
IT IS A CURIOUS THING REMARKED HOLMES THAT A TYPEWRITER HAS
REALLY QUITE AS MUCH INDIVIDUALITY AS A MANS HANDWRITING UNLESS
THEY ARE QUITE NEW NO TWO OF THEM WRITE EXACTLY ALIKE SOME LETTERS
GET MORE WORN THAN OTHERS AND SOME WEAR ONLY ON ONE SIDE NOW YOU
REMARK IN THIS NOTE OF YOURS MR WINDIBANK THAT IN EVERY CASE THERE
IS SOME LITTLE SLURRING OVER OF THE E AND A SLIGHT DEFECT IN THE
TAIL OF THE R THERE ARE FOURTEEN OTHER CHARACTERISTICS BUT THOSE
ARE THE MORE OBVIOUS
WE DO ALL OUR CORRESPONDENCE WITH THIS MACHINE AT THE OFFICE AND NO
DOUBT IT IS A LITTLE WORN OUR VISITOR ANSWERED GLANCING KEENLY AT
HOLMES WITH HIS BRIGHT LITTLE EYES
AND NOW I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT IS REALLY A VERY INTERESTING STUDY MR
WINDIBANK HOLMES CONTINUED I THINK OF WRITING ANOTHER LITTLE
MONOGRAPH SOME OF THESE DAYS ON THE TYPEWRITER AND ITS RELATION TO
CRIME IT IS A SUBJECT TO WHICH I HAVE DEVOTED SOME LITTLE ATTENTION
I HAVE HERE FOUR LETTERS WHICH PURPORT TO COME FROM THE MISSING MAN
THEY ARE ALL TYPEWRITTEN IN EACH CASE NOT ONLY ARE THE ES
SLURRED AND THE RS TAILLESS BUT YOU WILL OBSERVE IF YOU CARE TO
USE MY MAGNIFYING LENS THAT THE FOURTEEN OTHER CHARACTERISTICS TO
WHICH I HAVE ALLUDED ARE THERE AS WELL
MR WINDIBANK SPRANG OUT OF HIS CHAIR AND PICKED UP HIS HAT I
CANNOT WASTE TIME OVER THIS SORT OF FANTASTIC TALK MR HOLMES HE
SAID IF YOU CAN CATCH THE MAN CATCH HIM AND LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU
HAVE DONE IT
CERTAINLY SAID HOLMES STEPPING OVER AND TURNING THE KEY IN THE
DOOR I LET YOU KNOW THEN THAT I HAVE CAUGHT HIM
WHAT WHERE SHOUTED MR WINDIBANK TURNING WHITE TO HIS LIPS AND
GLANCING ABOUT HIM LIKE A RAT IN A TRAP
OH IT WONT DOREALLY IT WONT SAID HOLMES SUAVELY THERE IS NO
POSSIBLE GETTING OUT OF IT MR WINDIBANK IT IS QUITE TOO
TRANSPARENT AND IT WAS A VERY BAD COMPLIMENT WHEN YOU SAID THAT IT
WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SOLVE SO SIMPLE A QUESTION THATS RIGHT
SIT DOWN AND LET US TALK IT OVER
OUR VISITOR COLLAPSED INTO A CHAIR WITH A GHASTLY FACE AND A GLITTER
OF MOISTURE ON HIS BROW ITITS NOT ACTIONABLE HE STAMMERED
I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID THAT IT IS NOT BUT BETWEEN OURSELVES
WINDIBANK IT WAS AS CRUEL AND SELFISH AND HEARTLESS A TRICK IN A
PETTY WAY AS EVER CAME BEFORE ME NOW LET ME JUST RUN OVER THE
COURSE OF EVENTS AND YOU WILL CONTRADICT ME IF I GO WRONG
THE MAN SAT HUDDLED UP IN HIS CHAIR WITH HIS HEAD SUNK UPON HIS
BREAST LIKE ONE WHO IS UTTERLY CRUSHED HOLMES STUCK HIS FEET UP ON
THE CORNER OF THE MANTELPIECE AND LEANING BACK WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS
POCKETS BEGAN TALKING RATHER TO HIMSELF AS IT SEEMED THAN TO US
THE MAN MARRIED A WOMAN VERY MUCH OLDER THAN HIMSELF FOR HER MONEY
SAID HE AND HE ENJOYED THE USE OF THE MONEY OF THE DAUGHTER AS LONG
AS SHE LIVED WITH THEM IT WAS A CONSIDERABLE SUM FOR PEOPLE IN
THEIR POSITION AND THE LOSS OF IT WOULD HAVE MADE A SERIOUS
DIFFERENCE IT WAS WORTH AN EFFORT TO PRESERVE IT THE DAUGHTER WAS
OF A GOOD AMIABLE DISPOSITION BUT AFFECTIONATE AND WARMHEARTED IN
HER WAYS SO THAT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WITH HER FAIR PERSONAL
ADVANTAGES AND HER LITTLE INCOME SHE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN
SINGLE LONG NOW HER MARRIAGE WOULD MEAN OF COURSE THE LOSS OF A
HUNDRED A YEAR SO WHAT DOES HER STEPFATHER DO TO PREVENT IT HE
TAKES THE OBVIOUS COURSE OF KEEPING HER AT HOME AND FORBIDDING HER TO
SEEK THE COMPANY OF PEOPLE OF HER OWN AGE BUT SOON HE FOUND THAT
THAT WOULD NOT ANSWER FOREVER SHE BECAME RESTIVE INSISTED UPON HER
RIGHTS AND FINALLY ANNOUNCED HER POSITIVE INTENTION OF GOING TO A
CERTAIN BALL WHAT DOES HER CLEVER STEPFATHER DO THEN HE CONCEIVES
AN IDEA MORE CREDITABLE TO HIS HEAD THAN TO HIS HEART WITH THE
CONNIVANCE AND ASSISTANCE OF HIS WIFE HE DISGUISED HIMSELF COVERED
THOSE KEEN EYES WITH TINTED GLASSES MASKED THE FACE WITH A MOUSTACHE
AND A PAIR OF BUSHY WHISKERS SUNK THAT CLEAR VOICE INTO AN
INSINUATING WHISPER AND DOUBLY SECURE ON ACCOUNT OF THE GIRLS SHORT
SIGHT HE APPEARS AS MR HOSMER ANGEL AND KEEPS OFF OTHER LOVERS BY
MAKING LOVE HIMSELF
IT WAS ONLY A JOKE AT FIRST GROANED OUR VISITOR WE NEVER THOUGHT
THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO CARRIED AWAY
VERY LIKELY NOT HOWEVER THAT MAY BE THE YOUNG LADY WAS VERY
DECIDEDLY CARRIED AWAY AND HAVING QUITE MADE UP HER MIND THAT HER
STEPFATHER WAS IN FRANCE THE SUSPICION OF TREACHERY NEVER FOR AN
INSTANT ENTERED HER MIND SHE WAS FLATTERED BY THE GENTLEMANS
ATTENTIONS AND THE EFFECT WAS INCREASED BY THE LOUDLY EXPRESSED
ADMIRATION OF HER MOTHER THEN MR ANGEL BEGAN TO CALL FOR IT WAS
OBVIOUS THAT THE MATTER SHOULD BE PUSHED AS FAR AS IT WOULD GO IF A
REAL EFFECT WERE TO BE PRODUCED THERE WERE MEETINGS AND AN
ENGAGEMENT WHICH WOULD FINALLY SECURE THE GIRLS AFFECTIONS FROM
TURNING TOWARDS ANYONE ELSE BUT THE DECEPTION COULD NOT BE KEPT UP
FOREVER THESE PRETENDED JOURNEYS TO FRANCE WERE RATHER CUMBROUS THE
THING TO DO WAS CLEARLY TO BRING THE BUSINESS TO AN END IN SUCH A
DRAMATIC MANNER THAT IT WOULD LEAVE A PERMANENT IMPRESSION UPON THE
YOUNG LADYS MIND AND PREVENT HER FROM LOOKING UPON ANY OTHER SUITOR
FOR SOME TIME TO COME HENCE THOSE VOWS OF FIDELITY EXACTED UPON A
TESTAMENT AND HENCE ALSO THE ALLUSIONS TO A POSSIBILITY OF SOMETHING
HAPPENING ON THE VERY MORNING OF THE WEDDING JAMES WINDIBANK WISHED
MISS SUTHERLAND TO BE SO BOUND TO HOSMER ANGEL AND SO UNCERTAIN AS
TO HIS FATE THAT FOR TEN YEARS TO COME AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT
LISTEN TO ANOTHER MAN AS FAR AS THE CHURCH DOOR HE BROUGHT HER AND
THEN AS HE COULD GO NO FARTHER HE CONVENIENTLY VANISHED AWAY BY THE
OLD TRICK OF STEPPING IN AT ONE DOOR OF A FOURWHEELER AND OUT AT THE
OTHER I THINK THAT WAS THE CHAIN OF EVENTS MR WINDIBANK
OUR VISITOR HAD RECOVERED SOMETHING OF HIS ASSURANCE WHILE HOLMES HAD
BEEN TALKING AND HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR NOW WITH A COLD SNEER UPON
HIS PALE FACE
IT MAY BE SO OR IT MAY NOT MR HOLMES SAID HE BUT IF YOU ARE
SO VERY SHARP YOU OUGHT TO BE SHARP ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT IT IS YOU WHO
ARE BREAKING THE LAW NOW AND NOT ME I HAVE DONE NOTHING ACTIONABLE
FROM THE FIRST BUT AS LONG AS YOU KEEP THAT DOOR LOCKED YOU LAY
YOURSELF OPEN TO AN ACTION FOR ASSAULT AND ILLEGAL CONSTRAINT
THE LAW CANNOT AS YOU SAY TOUCH YOU SAID HOLMES UNLOCKING AND
THROWING OPEN THE DOOR YET THERE NEVER WAS A MAN WHO DESERVED
PUNISHMENT MORE IF THE YOUNG LADY HAS A BROTHER OR A FRIEND HE
OUGHT TO LAY A WHIP ACROSS YOUR SHOULDERS BY JOVE HE CONTINUED
FLUSHING UP AT THE SIGHT OF THE BITTER SNEER UPON THE MANS FACE IT
IS NOT PART OF MY DUTIES TO MY CLIENT BUT HERES A HUNTING CROP
HANDY AND I THINK I SHALL JUST TREAT MYSELF TO HE TOOK TWO SWIFT
STEPS TO THE WHIP BUT BEFORE HE COULD GRASP IT THERE WAS A WILD
CLATTER OF STEPS UPON THE STAIRS THE HEAVY HALL DOOR BANGED AND
FROM THE WINDOW WE COULD SEE MR JAMES WINDIBANK RUNNING AT THE TOP
OF HIS SPEED DOWN THE ROAD
THERES A COLDBLOODED SCOUNDREL SAID HOLMES LAUGHING AS HE
THREW HIMSELF DOWN INTO HIS CHAIR ONCE MORE THAT FELLOW WILL RISE
FROM CRIME TO CRIME UNTIL HE DOES SOMETHING VERY BAD AND ENDS ON A
GALLOWS THE CASE HAS IN SOME RESPECTS BEEN NOT ENTIRELY DEVOID OF
INTEREST
I CANNOT NOW ENTIRELY SEE ALL THE STEPS OF YOUR REASONING I
REMARKED
WELL OF COURSE IT WAS OBVIOUS FROM THE FIRST THAT THIS MR HOSMER
ANGEL MUST HAVE SOME STRONG OBJECT FOR HIS CURIOUS CONDUCT AND IT
WAS EQUALLY CLEAR THAT THE ONLY MAN WHO REALLY PROFITED BY THE
INCIDENT AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE WAS THE STEPFATHER THEN THE FACT
THAT THE TWO MEN WERE NEVER TOGETHER BUT THAT THE ONE ALWAYS
APPEARED WHEN THE OTHER WAS AWAY WAS SUGGESTIVE SO WERE THE TINTED
SPECTACLES AND THE CURIOUS VOICE WHICH BOTH HINTED AT A DISGUISE AS
DID THE BUSHY WHISKERS MY SUSPICIONS WERE ALL CONFIRMED BY HIS
PECULIAR ACTION IN TYPEWRITING HIS SIGNATURE WHICH OF COURSE
INFERRED THAT HIS HANDWRITING WAS SO FAMILIAR TO HER THAT SHE WOULD
RECOGNISE EVEN THE SMALLEST SAMPLE OF IT YOU SEE ALL THESE ISOLATED
FACTS TOGETHER WITH MANY MINOR ONES ALL POINTED IN THE SAME
DIRECTION
AND HOW DID YOU VERIFY THEM
HAVING ONCE SPOTTED MY MAN IT WAS EASY TO GET CORROBORATION I KNEW
THE FIRM FOR WHICH THIS MAN WORKED HAVING TAKEN THE PRINTED
DESCRIPTION I ELIMINATED EVERYTHING FROM IT WHICH COULD BE THE
RESULT OF A DISGUISETHE WHISKERS THE GLASSES THE VOICE AND I
SENT IT TO THE FIRM WITH A REQUEST THAT THEY WOULD INFORM ME WHETHER
IT ANSWERED TO THE DESCRIPTION OF ANY OF THEIR TRAVELLERS I HAD
ALREADY NOTICED THE PECULIARITIES OF THE TYPEWRITER AND I WROTE TO
THE MAN HIMSELF AT HIS BUSINESS ADDRESS ASKING HIM IF HE WOULD COME
HERE AS I EXPECTED HIS REPLY WAS TYPEWRITTEN AND REVEALED THE SAME
TRIVIAL BUT CHARACTERISTIC DEFECTS THE SAME POST BROUGHT ME A LETTER
FROM WESTHOUSE MARBANK OF FENCHURCH STREET TO SAY THAT THE
DESCRIPTION TALLIED IN EVERY RESPECT WITH THAT OF THEIR EMPLOYEE
JAMES WINDIBANK VOIL TOUT
AND MISS SUTHERLAND
IF I TELL HER SHE WILL NOT BELIEVE ME YOU MAY REMEMBER THE OLD
PERSIAN SAYING THERE IS DANGER FOR HIM WHO TAKETH THE TIGER CUB
AND DANGER ALSO FOR WHOSO SNATCHES A DELUSION FROM A WOMAN THERE IS
AS MUCH SENSE IN HAFIZ AS IN HORACE AND AS MUCH KNOWLEDGE OF THE
WORLD
THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
WE WERE SEATED AT BREAKFAST ONE MORNING MY WIFE AND I WHEN THE MAID
BROUGHT IN A TELEGRAM IT WAS FROM SHERLOCK HOLMES AND RAN IN THIS
WAY
HAVE YOU A COUPLE OF DAYS TO SPARE HAVE JUST BEEN WIRED FOR FROM
THE WEST OF ENGLAND IN CONNECTION WITH BOSCOMBE VALLEY TRAGEDY SHALL
BE GLAD IF YOU WILL COME WITH ME AIR AND SCENERY PERFECT LEAVE
PADDINGTON BY THE WHAT DO YOU SAY DEAR SAID MY WIFE LOOKING ACROSS AT
ME WILL
YOU GO I REALLY DONT KNOW WHAT TO SAY I HAVE A FAIRLY LONG LIST AT
PRESENT
OH ANSTRUTHER WOULD DO YOUR WORK FOR YOU YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING A
LITTLE PALE LATELY I THINK THAT THE CHANGE WOULD DO YOU GOOD AND
YOU ARE ALWAYS SO INTERESTED IN MR SHERLOCK HOLMES CASES
I SHOULD BE UNGRATEFUL IF I WERE NOT SEEING WHAT I GAINED THROUGH
ONE OF THEM I ANSWERED BUT IF I AM TO GO I MUST PACK AT ONCE
FOR I HAVE ONLY HALF AN HOUR
MY EXPERIENCE OF CAMP LIFE IN AFGHANISTAN HAD AT LEAST HAD THE EFFECT
OF MAKING ME A PROMPT AND READY TRAVELLER MY WANTS WERE FEW AND
SIMPLE SO THAT IN LESS THAN THE TIME STATED I WAS IN A CAB WITH MY
VALISE RATTLING AWAY TO PADDINGTON STATION SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS
PACING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM HIS TALL GAUNT FIGURE MADE EVEN
GAUNTER AND TALLER BY HIS LONG GREY TRAVELLINGCLOAK AND
CLOSEFITTING CLOTH CAP
IT IS REALLY VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME WATSON SAID HE IT MAKES A
CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE TO ME HAVING SOMEONE WITH ME ON WHOM I CAN
THOROUGHLY RELY LOCAL AID IS ALWAYS EITHER WORTHLESS OR ELSE
BIASSED IF YOU WILL KEEP THE TWO CORNER SEATS I SHALL GET THE
TICKETS
WE HAD THE CARRIAGE TO OURSELVES SAVE FOR AN IMMENSE LITTER OF PAPERS
WHICH HOLMES HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AMONG THESE HE RUMMAGED AND READ
WITH INTERVALS OF NOTETAKING AND OF MEDITATION UNTIL WE WERE PAST
READING THEN HE SUDDENLY ROLLED THEM ALL INTO A GIGANTIC BALL AND
TOSSED THEM UP ONTO THE RACK
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING OF THE CASE HE ASKED
NOT A WORD I HAVE NOT SEEN A PAPER FOR SOME DAYS
THE LONDON PRESS HAS NOT HAD VERY FULL ACCOUNTS I HAVE JUST BEEN
LOOKING THROUGH ALL THE RECENT PAPERS IN ORDER TO MASTER THE
PARTICULARS IT SEEMS FROM WHAT I GATHER TO BE ONE OF THOSE SIMPLE
CASES WHICH ARE SO EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE PARADOXICAL
BUT IT IS PROFOUNDLY TRUE SINGULARITY IS ALMOST INVARIABLY A CLUE
THE MORE FEATURELESS AND COMMONPLACE A CRIME IS THE MORE DIFFICULT
IT IS TO BRING IT HOME IN THIS CASE HOWEVER THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED
A VERY SERIOUS CASE AGAINST THE SON OF THE MURDERED MAN
IT IS A MURDER THEN
WELL IT IS CONJECTURED TO BE SO I SHALL TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED
UNTIL I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF LOOKING PERSONALLY INTO IT I WILL
EXPLAIN THE STATE OF THINGS TO YOU AS FAR AS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
UNDERSTAND IT IN A VERY FEW WORDS
BOSCOMBE VALLEY IS A COUNTRY DISTRICT NOT VERY FAR FROM ROSS IN
HEREFORDSHIRE THE LARGEST LANDED PROPRIETOR IN THAT PART IS A MR
JOHN TURNER WHO MADE HIS MONEY IN AUSTRALIA AND RETURNED SOME YEARS
AGO TO THE OLD COUNTRY ONE OF THE FARMS WHICH HE HELD THAT OF
HATHERLEY WAS LET TO MR CHARLES MCCARTHY WHO WAS ALSO AN
EXAUSTRALIAN THE MEN HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER IN THE COLONIES SO THAT
IT WAS NOT UNNATURAL THAT WHEN THEY CAME TO SETTLE DOWN THEY SHOULD
DO SO AS NEAR EACH OTHER AS POSSIBLE TURNER WAS APPARENTLY THE
RICHER MAN SO MCCARTHY BECAME HIS TENANT BUT STILL REMAINED IT
SEEMS UPON TERMS OF PERFECT EQUALITY AS THEY WERE FREQUENTLY
TOGETHER MCCARTHY HAD ONE SON A LAD OF EIGHTEEN AND TURNER HAD AN
ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE SAME AGE BUT NEITHER OF THEM HAD WIVES LIVING
THEY APPEAR TO HAVE AVOIDED THE SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBOURING ENGLISH
FAMILIES AND TO HAVE LED RETIRED LIVES THOUGH BOTH THE MCCARTHYS
WERE FOND OF SPORT AND WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN AT THE RACEMEETINGS OF
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD MCCARTHY KEPT TWO SERVANTSA MAN AND A GIRL
TURNER HAD A CONSIDERABLE HOUSEHOLD SOME HALFDOZEN AT THE LEAST
THAT IS AS MUCH AS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER ABOUT THE FAMILIES NOW
FOR THE FACTS
ON JUNE RD THAT IS ON MONDAY LAST MCCARTHY LEFT HIS HOUSE AT
HATHERLEY ABOUT THREE IN THE AFTERNOON AND WALKED DOWN TO THE
BOSCOMBE POOL WHICH IS A SMALL LAKE FORMED BY THE SPREADING OUT OF
THE STREAM WHICH RUNS DOWN THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY HE HAD BEEN OUT WITH
HIS SERVINGMAN IN THE MORNING AT ROSS AND HE HAD TOLD THE MAN THAT
HE MUST HURRY AS HE HAD AN APPOINTMENT OF IMPORTANCE TO KEEP AT
THREE FROM THAT APPOINTMENT HE NEVER CAME BACK ALIVE
FROM HATHERLEY FARMHOUSE TO THE BOSCOMBE POOL IS A QUARTER OF A
MILE AND TWO PEOPLE SAW HIM AS HE PASSED OVER THIS GROUND ONE WAS
AN OLD WOMAN WHOSE NAME IS NOT MENTIONED AND THE OTHER WAS WILLIAM
CROWDER A GAMEKEEPER IN THE EMPLOY OF MR TURNER BOTH THESE
WITNESSES DEPOSE THAT MR MCCARTHY WAS WALKING ALONE THE GAMEKEEPER
ADDS THAT WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF HIS SEEING MR MCCARTHY PASS HE HAD
SEEN HIS SON MR JAMES MCCARTHY GOING THE SAME WAY WITH A GUN UNDER
HIS ARM TO THE BEST OF HIS BELIEF THE FATHER WAS ACTUALLY IN SIGHT
AT THE TIME AND THE SON WAS FOLLOWING HIM HE THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE
MATTER UNTIL HE HEARD IN THE EVENING OF THE TRAGEDY THAT HAD
OCCURRED
THE TWO MCCARTHYS WERE SEEN AFTER THE TIME WHEN WILLIAM CROWDER THE
GAMEKEEPER LOST SIGHT OF THEM THE BOSCOMBE POOL IS THICKLY WOODED
ROUND WITH JUST A FRINGE OF GRASS AND OF REEDS ROUND THE EDGE A
GIRL OF FOURTEEN PATIENCE MORAN WHO IS THE DAUGHTER OF THE
LODGEKEEPER OF THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY ESTATE WAS IN ONE OF THE WOODS
PICKING FLOWERS SHE STATES THAT WHILE SHE WAS THERE SHE SAW AT THE
BORDER OF THE WOOD AND CLOSE BY THE LAKE MR MCCARTHY AND HIS SON
AND THAT THEY APPEARED TO BE HAVING A VIOLENT QUARREL SHE HEARD MR
MCCARTHY THE ELDER USING VERY STRONG LANGUAGE TO HIS SON AND SHE SAW
THE LATTER RAISE UP HIS HAND AS IF TO STRIKE HIS FATHER SHE WAS SO
FRIGHTENED BY THEIR VIOLENCE THAT SHE RAN AWAY AND TOLD HER MOTHER
WHEN SHE REACHED HOME THAT SHE HAD LEFT THE TWO MCCARTHYS QUARRELLING
NEAR BOSCOMBE POOL AND THAT SHE WAS AFRAID THAT THEY WERE GOING TO
FIGHT SHE HAD HARDLY SAID THE WORDS WHEN YOUNG MR MCCARTHY CAME
RUNNING UP TO THE LODGE TO SAY THAT HE HAD FOUND HIS FATHER DEAD IN
THE WOOD AND TO ASK FOR THE HELP OF THE LODGEKEEPER HE WAS MUCH
EXCITED WITHOUT EITHER HIS GUN OR HIS HAT AND HIS RIGHT HAND AND
SLEEVE WERE OBSERVED TO BE STAINED WITH FRESH BLOOD ON FOLLOWING HIM
THEY FOUND THE DEAD BODY STRETCHED OUT UPON THE GRASS BESIDE THE
POOL THE HEAD HAD BEEN BEATEN IN BY REPEATED BLOWS OF SOME HEAVY AND
BLUNT WEAPON THE INJURIES WERE SUCH AS MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE BEEN
INFLICTED BY THE BUTTEND OF HIS SONS GUN WHICH WAS FOUND LYING ON
THE GRASS WITHIN A FEW PACES OF THE BODY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
THE YOUNG MAN WAS INSTANTLY ARRESTED AND A VERDICT OF WILFUL
MURDER HAVING BEEN RETURNED AT THE INQUEST ON TUESDAY HE WAS ON
WEDNESDAY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES AT ROSS WHO HAVE REFERRED
THE CASE TO THE NEXT ASSIZES THOSE ARE THE MAIN FACTS OF THE CASE AS
THEY CAME OUT BEFORE THE CORONER AND THE POLICECOURT
I COULD HARDLY IMAGINE A MORE DAMNING CASE I REMARKED IF EVER
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE POINTED TO A CRIMINAL IT DOES SO HERE
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IS A VERY TRICKY THING ANSWERED HOLMES
THOUGHTFULLY IT MAY SEEM TO POINT VERY STRAIGHT TO ONE THING BUT
IF YOU SHIFT YOUR OWN POINT OF VIEW A LITTLE YOU MAY FIND IT
POINTING IN AN EQUALLY UNCOMPROMISING MANNER TO SOMETHING ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT IT MUST BE CONFESSED HOWEVER THAT THE CASE LOOKS
EXCEEDINGLY GRAVE AGAINST THE YOUNG MAN AND IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT
HE IS INDEED THE CULPRIT THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD HOWEVER AND AMONG THEM MISS TURNER THE DAUGHTER OF
THE NEIGHBOURING LANDOWNER WHO BELIEVE IN HIS INNOCENCE AND WHO
HAVE RETAINED LESTRADE WHOM YOU MAY RECOLLECT IN CONNECTION WITH THE
STUDY IN SCARLET TO WORK OUT THE CASE IN HIS INTEREST LESTRADE
BEING RATHER PUZZLED HAS REFERRED THE CASE TO ME AND HENCE IT IS
THAT TWO MIDDLEAGED GENTLEMEN ARE FLYING WESTWARD AT FIFTY MILES AN
HOUR INSTEAD OF QUIETLY DIGESTING THEIR BREAKFASTS AT HOME
I AM AFRAID SAID I THAT THE FACTS ARE SO OBVIOUS THAT YOU WILL
FIND LITTLE CREDIT TO BE GAINED OUT OF THIS CASE
THERE IS NOTHING MORE DECEPTIVE THAN AN OBVIOUS FACT HE ANSWERED
LAUGHING BESIDES WE MAY CHANCE TO HIT UPON SOME OTHER OBVIOUS
FACTS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN BY NO MEANS OBVIOUS TO MR LESTRADE YOU
KNOW ME TOO WELL TO THINK THAT I AM BOASTING WHEN I SAY THAT I SHALL
EITHER CONFIRM OR DESTROY HIS THEORY BY MEANS WHICH HE IS QUITE
INCAPABLE OF EMPLOYING OR EVEN OF UNDERSTANDING TO TAKE THE FIRST
EXAMPLE TO HAND I VERY CLEARLY PERCEIVE THAT IN YOUR BEDROOM THE
WINDOW IS UPON THE RIGHTHAND SIDE AND YET I QUESTION WHETHER MR
LESTRADE WOULD HAVE NOTED EVEN SO SELFEVIDENT A THING AS THAT
HOW ON EARTH
MY DEAR FELLOW I KNOW YOU WELL I KNOW THE MILITARY NEATNESS WHICH
CHARACTERISES YOU YOU SHAVE EVERY MORNING AND IN THIS SEASON YOU
SHAVE BY THE SUNLIGHT BUT SINCE YOUR SHAVING IS LESS AND LESS
COMPLETE AS WE GET FARTHER BACK ON THE LEFT SIDE UNTIL IT BECOMES
POSITIVELY SLOVENLY AS WE GET ROUND THE ANGLE OF THE JAW IT IS
SURELY VERY CLEAR THAT THAT SIDE IS LESS ILLUMINATED THAN THE OTHER
I COULD NOT IMAGINE A MAN OF YOUR HABITS LOOKING AT HIMSELF IN AN
EQUAL LIGHT AND BEING SATISFIED WITH SUCH A RESULT I ONLY QUOTE THIS
AS A TRIVIAL EXAMPLE OF OBSERVATION AND INFERENCE THEREIN LIES MY
MTIER AND IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT IT MAY BE OF SOME SERVICE IN THE
INVESTIGATION WHICH LIES BEFORE US THERE ARE ONE OR TWO MINOR POINTS
WHICH WERE BROUGHT OUT IN THE INQUEST AND WHICH ARE WORTH
CONSIDERING
WHAT ARE THEY
IT APPEARS THAT HIS ARREST DID NOT TAKE PLACE AT ONCE BUT AFTER THE
RETURN TO HATHERLEY FARM ON THE INSPECTOR OF CONSTABULARY INFORMING
HIM THAT HE WAS A PRISONER HE REMARKED THAT HE WAS NOT SURPRISED TO
HEAR IT AND THAT IT WAS NO MORE THAN HIS DESERTS THIS OBSERVATION
OF HIS HAD THE NATURAL EFFECT OF REMOVING ANY TRACES OF DOUBT WHICH
MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN THE MINDS OF THE CORONERS JURY
IT WAS A CONFESSION I EJACULATED
NO FOR IT WAS FOLLOWED BY A PROTESTATION OF INNOCENCE
COMING ON THE TOP OF SUCH A DAMNING SERIES OF EVENTS IT WAS AT
LEAST A MOST SUSPICIOUS REMARK
ON THE CONTRARY SAID HOLMES IT IS THE BRIGHTEST RIFT WHICH I CAN
AT PRESENT SEE IN THE CLOUDS HOWEVER INNOCENT HE MIGHT BE HE COULD
NOT BE SUCH AN ABSOLUTE IMBECILE AS NOT TO SEE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES
WERE VERY BLACK AGAINST HIM HAD HE APPEARED SURPRISED AT HIS OWN
ARREST OR FEIGNED INDIGNATION AT IT I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED UPON IT AS
HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS BECAUSE SUCH SURPRISE OR ANGER WOULD NOT BE
NATURAL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND YET MIGHT APPEAR TO BE THE BEST
POLICY TO A SCHEMING MAN HIS FRANK ACCEPTANCE OF THE SITUATION MARKS
HIM AS EITHER AN INNOCENT MAN OR ELSE AS A MAN OF CONSIDERABLE
SELFRESTRAINT AND FIRMNESS AS TO HIS REMARK ABOUT HIS DESERTS IT
WAS ALSO NOT UNNATURAL IF YOU CONSIDER THAT HE STOOD BESIDE THE DEAD
BODY OF HIS FATHER AND THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HE HAD THAT VERY
DAY SO FAR FORGOTTEN HIS FILIAL DUTY AS TO BANDY WORDS WITH HIM AND
EVEN ACCORDING TO THE LITTLE GIRL WHOSE EVIDENCE IS SO IMPORTANT TO
RAISE HIS HAND AS IF TO STRIKE HIM THE SELFREPROACH AND CONTRITION
WHICH ARE DISPLAYED IN HIS REMARK APPEAR TO ME TO BE THE SIGNS OF A
HEALTHY MIND RATHER THAN OF A GUILTY ONE
I SHOOK MY HEAD MANY MEN HAVE BEEN HANGED ON FAR SLIGHTER
EVIDENCE I REMARKED
SO THEY HAVE AND MANY MEN HAVE BEEN WRONGFULLY HANGED
WHAT IS THE YOUNG MANS OWN ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER
IT IS I AM AFRAID NOT VERY ENCOURAGING TO HIS SUPPORTERS THOUGH
THERE ARE ONE OR TWO POINTS IN IT WHICH ARE SUGGESTIVE YOU WILL FIND
IT HERE AND MAY READ IT FOR YOURSELF
HE PICKED OUT FROM HIS BUNDLE A COPY OF THE LOCAL HEREFORDSHIRE
PAPER AND HAVING TURNED DOWN THE SHEET HE POINTED OUT THE PARAGRAPH
IN WHICH THE UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN HAD GIVEN HIS OWN STATEMENT OF
WHAT HAD OCCURRED I SETTLED MYSELF DOWN IN THE CORNER OF THE
CARRIAGE AND READ IT VERY CAREFULLY IT RAN IN THIS WAY
MR JAMES MCCARTHY THE ONLY SON OF THE DECEASED WAS THEN CALLED
AND GAVE EVIDENCE AS FOLLOWS I HAD BEEN AWAY FROM HOME FOR THREE
DAYS AT BRISTOL AND HAD ONLY JUST RETURNED UPON THE MORNING OF LAST
MONDAY THE RD MY FATHER WAS ABSENT FROM HOME AT THE TIME OF MY
ARRIVAL AND I WAS INFORMED BY THE MAID THAT HE HAD DRIVEN OVER TO
ROSS WITH JOHN COBB THE GROOM SHORTLY AFTER MY RETURN I HEARD THE
WHEELS OF HIS TRAP IN THE YARD AND LOOKING OUT OF MY WINDOW I SAW
HIM GET OUT AND WALK RAPIDLY OUT OF THE YARD THOUGH I WAS NOT AWARE
IN WHICH DIRECTION HE WAS GOING I THEN TOOK MY GUN AND STROLLED OUT
IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BOSCOMBE POOL WITH THE INTENTION OF VISITING
THE RABBIT WARREN WHICH IS UPON THE OTHER SIDE ON MY WAY I SAW
WILLIAM CROWDER THE GAMEKEEPER AS HE HAD STATED IN HIS EVIDENCE
BUT HE IS MISTAKEN IN THINKING THAT I WAS FOLLOWING MY FATHER I HAD
NO IDEA THAT HE WAS IN FRONT OF ME WHEN ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM
THE POOL I HEARD A CRY OF COOEE WHICH WAS A USUAL SIGNAL BETWEEN
MY FATHER AND MYSELF I THEN HURRIED FORWARD AND FOUND HIM STANDING
BY THE POOL HE APPEARED TO BE MUCH SURPRISED AT SEEING ME AND ASKED
ME RATHER ROUGHLY WHAT I WAS DOING THERE A CONVERSATION ENSUED WHICH
LED TO HIGH WORDS AND ALMOST TO BLOWS FOR MY FATHER WAS A MAN OF A
VERY VIOLENT TEMPER SEEING THAT HIS PASSION WAS BECOMING
UNGOVERNABLE I LEFT HIM AND RETURNED TOWARDS HATHERLEY FARM I HAD
NOT GONE MORE THAN YARDS HOWEVER WHEN I HEARD A HIDEOUS OUTCRY
BEHIND ME WHICH CAUSED ME TO RUN BACK AGAIN I FOUND MY FATHER
EXPIRING UPON THE GROUND WITH HIS HEAD TERRIBLY INJURED I DROPPED
MY GUN AND HELD HIM IN MY ARMS BUT HE ALMOST INSTANTLY EXPIRED I
KNELT BESIDE HIM FOR SOME MINUTES AND THEN MADE MY WAY TO MR
TURNERS LODGEKEEPER HIS HOUSE BEING THE NEAREST TO ASK FOR
ASSISTANCE I SAW NO ONE NEAR MY FATHER WHEN I RETURNED AND I HAVE
NO IDEA HOW HE CAME BY HIS INJURIES HE WAS NOT A POPULAR MAN BEING
SOMEWHAT COLD AND FORBIDDING IN HIS MANNERS BUT HE HAD AS FAR AS I
KNOW NO ACTIVE ENEMIES I KNOW NOTHING FURTHER OF THE MATTER
THE CORONER DID YOUR FATHER MAKE ANY STATEMENT TO YOU BEFORE HE
DIED
WITNESS HE MUMBLED A FEW WORDS BUT I COULD ONLY CATCH SOME
ALLUSION TO A RAT
THE CORONER WHAT DID YOU UNDERSTAND BY THAT
WITNESS IT CONVEYED NO MEANING TO ME I THOUGHT THAT HE WAS
DELIRIOUS
THE CORONER WHAT WAS THE POINT UPON WHICH YOU AND YOUR FATHER HAD
THIS FINAL QUARREL
WITNESS I SHOULD PREFER NOT TO ANSWER
THE CORONER I AM AFRAID THAT I MUST PRESS IT
WITNESS IT IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TELL YOU I CAN ASSURE
YOU THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SAD TRAGEDY WHICH FOLLOWED
THE CORONER THAT IS FOR THE COURT TO DECIDE I NEED NOT POINT OUT
TO YOU THAT YOUR REFUSAL TO ANSWER WILL PREJUDICE YOUR CASE
CONSIDERABLY IN ANY FUTURE PROCEEDINGS WHICH MAY ARISE
WITNESS I MUST STILL REFUSE
THE CORONER I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CRY OF COOEE WAS A COMMON
SIGNAL BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR FATHER
WITNESS IT WAS
THE CORONER HOW WAS IT THEN THAT HE UTTERED IT BEFORE HE SAW YOU
AND BEFORE HE EVEN KNEW THAT YOU HAD RETURNED FROM BRISTOL
WITNESS WITH CONSIDERABLE CONFUSION I DO NOT KNOW
A JURYMAN DID YOU SEE NOTHING WHICH AROUSED YOUR SUSPICIONS WHEN
YOU RETURNED ON HEARING THE CRY AND FOUND YOUR FATHER FATALLY
INJURED
WITNESS NOTHING DEFINITE
THE CORONER WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WITNESS I WAS SO DISTURBED AND EXCITED AS I RUSHED OUT INTO THE
OPEN THAT I COULD THINK OF NOTHING EXCEPT OF MY FATHER YET I HAVE A
VAGUE IMPRESSION THAT AS I RAN FORWARD SOMETHING LAY UPON THE GROUND
TO THE LEFT OF ME IT SEEMED TO ME TO BE SOMETHING GREY IN COLOUR A
COAT OF SOME SORT OR A PLAID PERHAPS WHEN I ROSE FROM MY FATHER I
LOOKED ROUND FOR IT BUT IT WAS GONE
DO YOU MEAN THAT IT DISAPPEARED BEFORE YOU WENT FOR HELP
YES IT WAS GONE
YOU CANNOT SAY WHAT IT WAS
NO I HAD A FEELING SOMETHING WAS THERE
HOW FAR FROM THE BODY
A DOZEN YARDS OR SO
AND HOW FAR FROM THE EDGE OF THE WOOD
ABOUT THE SAME
THEN IF IT WAS REMOVED IT WAS WHILE YOU WERE WITHIN A DOZEN YARDS
OF IT
YES BUT WITH MY BACK TOWARDS IT
THIS CONCLUDED THE EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESS
I SEE SAID I AS I GLANCED DOWN THE COLUMN THAT THE CORONER IN
HIS CONCLUDING REMARKS WAS RATHER SEVERE UPON YOUNG MCCARTHY HE
CALLS ATTENTION AND WITH REASON TO THE DISCREPANCY ABOUT HIS FATHER
HAVING SIGNALLED TO HIM BEFORE SEEING HIM ALSO TO HIS REFUSAL TO
GIVE DETAILS OF HIS CONVERSATION WITH HIS FATHER AND HIS SINGULAR
ACCOUNT OF HIS FATHERS DYING WORDS THEY ARE ALL AS HE REMARKS
VERY MUCH AGAINST THE SON
HOLMES LAUGHED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF AND STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT UPON THE
CUSHIONED SEAT BOTH YOU AND THE CORONER HAVE BEEN AT SOME PAINS
SAID HE TO SINGLE OUT THE VERY STRONGEST POINTS IN THE YOUNG MANS
FAVOUR DONT YOU SEE THAT YOU ALTERNATELY GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR HAVING
TOO MUCH IMAGINATION AND TOO LITTLE TOO LITTLE IF HE COULD NOT
INVENT A CAUSE OF QUARREL WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM THE SYMPATHY OF THE
JURY TOO MUCH IF HE EVOLVED FROM HIS OWN INNER CONSCIOUSNESS
ANYTHING SO OUTR AS A DYING REFERENCE TO A RAT AND THE INCIDENT OF
THE VANISHING CLOTH NO SIR I SHALL APPROACH THIS CASE FROM THE
POINT OF VIEW THAT WHAT THIS YOUNG MAN SAYS IS TRUE AND WE SHALL SEE
WHITHER THAT HYPOTHESIS WILL LEAD US AND NOW HERE IS MY POCKET
PETRARCH AND NOT ANOTHER WORD SHALL I SAY OF THIS CASE UNTIL WE ARE
ON THE SCENE OF ACTION WE LUNCH AT SWINDON AND I SEE THAT WE SHALL
BE THERE IN TWENTY MINUTES
IT WAS NEARLY FOUR OCLOCK WHEN WE AT LAST AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE
BEAUTIFUL STROUD VALLEY AND OVER THE BROAD GLEAMING SEVERN FOUND
OURSELVES AT THE PRETTY LITTLE COUNTRYTOWN OF ROSS A LEAN
FERRETLIKE MAN FURTIVE AND SLYLOOKING WAS WAITING FOR US UPON THE
PLATFORM IN SPITE OF THE LIGHT BROWN DUSTCOAT AND LEATHERLEGGINGS
WHICH HE WORE IN DEFERENCE TO HIS RUSTIC SURROUNDINGS I HAD NO
DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNISING LESTRADE OF SCOTLAND YARD WITH HIM WE
DROVE TO THE HEREFORD ARMS WHERE A ROOM HAD ALREADY BEEN ENGAGED FOR
US
I HAVE ORDERED A CARRIAGE SAID LESTRADE AS WE SAT OVER A CUP OF
TEA I KNEW YOUR ENERGETIC NATURE AND THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE HAPPY
UNTIL YOU HAD BEEN ON THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
IT WAS VERY NICE AND COMPLIMENTARY OF YOU HOLMES ANSWERED IT IS
ENTIRELY A QUESTION OF BAROMETRIC PRESSURE
LESTRADE LOOKED STARTLED I DO NOT QUITE FOLLOW HE SAID
HOW IS THE GLASS TWENTYNINE I SEE NO WIND AND NOT A CLOUD IN
THE SKY I HAVE A CASEFUL OF CIGARETTES HERE WHICH NEED SMOKING AND
THE SOFA IS VERY MUCH SUPERIOR TO THE USUAL COUNTRY HOTEL
ABOMINATION I DO NOT THINK THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT I SHALL USE THE
CARRIAGE TONIGHT
LESTRADE LAUGHED INDULGENTLY YOU HAVE NO DOUBT ALREADY FORMED
YOUR CONCLUSIONS FROM THE NEWSPAPERS HE SAID THE CASE IS AS PLAIN
AS A PIKESTAFF AND THE MORE ONE GOES INTO IT THE PLAINER IT BECOMES
STILL OF COURSE ONE CANT REFUSE A LADY AND SUCH A VERY POSITIVE
ONE TOO SHE HAS HEARD OF YOU AND WOULD HAVE YOUR OPINION THOUGH I
REPEATEDLY TOLD HER THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WHICH YOU COULD DO WHICH I
HAD NOT ALREADY DONE WHY BLESS MY SOUL HERE IS HER CARRIAGE AT THE
DOOR
HE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN BEFORE THERE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM ONE OF THE
MOST LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE HER VIOLET
EYES SHINING HER LIPS PARTED A PINK FLUSH UPON HER CHEEKS ALL
THOUGHT OF HER NATURAL RESERVE LOST IN HER OVERPOWERING EXCITEMENT
AND CONCERN
OH MR SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE CRIED GLANCING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
OF US AND FINALLY WITH A WOMANS QUICK INTUITION FASTENING UPON MY
COMPANION I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU HAVE COME I HAVE DRIVEN DOWN TO
TELL YOU SO I KNOW THAT JAMES DIDNT DO IT I KNOW IT AND I WANT
YOU TO START UPON YOUR WORK KNOWING IT TOO NEVER LET YOURSELF DOUBT
UPON THAT POINT WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE WE WERE LITTLE
CHILDREN AND I KNOW HIS FAULTS AS NO ONE ELSE DOES BUT HE IS TOO
TENDERHEARTED TO HURT A FLY SUCH A CHARGE IS ABSURD TO ANYONE WHO
REALLY KNOWS HIM
I HOPE WE MAY CLEAR HIM MISS TURNER SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES YOU
MAY RELY UPON MY DOING ALL THAT I CAN
BUT YOU HAVE READ THE EVIDENCE YOU HAVE FORMED SOME CONCLUSION DO
YOU NOT SEE SOME LOOPHOLE SOME FLAW DO YOU NOT YOURSELF THINK THAT
HE IS INNOCENT
I THINK THAT IT IS VERY PROBABLE
THERE NOW SHE CRIED THROWING BACK HER HEAD AND LOOKING DEFIANTLY
AT LESTRADE YOU HEAR HE GIVES ME HOPES
LESTRADE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I AM AFRAID THAT MY COLLEAGUE HAS
BEEN A LITTLE QUICK IN FORMING HIS CONCLUSIONS HE SAID
BUT HE IS RIGHT OH I KNOW THAT HE IS RIGHT JAMES NEVER DID IT
AND ABOUT HIS QUARREL WITH HIS FATHER I AM SURE THAT THE REASON WHY
HE WOULD NOT SPEAK ABOUT IT TO THE CORONER WAS BECAUSE I WAS
CONCERNED IN IT
IN WHAT WAY ASKED HOLMES
IT IS NO TIME FOR ME TO HIDE ANYTHING JAMES AND HIS FATHER HAD MANY
DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT ME MR MCCARTHY WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT THERE
SHOULD BE A MARRIAGE BETWEEN US JAMES AND I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED EACH
OTHER AS BROTHER AND SISTER BUT OF COURSE HE IS YOUNG AND HAS SEEN
VERY LITTLE OF LIFE YET ANDANDWELL HE NATURALLY DID NOT WISH TO
DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT YET SO THERE WERE QUARRELS AND THIS I AM
SURE WAS ONE OF THEM
AND YOUR FATHER ASKED HOLMES WAS HE IN FAVOUR OF SUCH A UNION
NO HE WAS AVERSE TO IT ALSO NO ONE BUT MR MCCARTHY WAS IN FAVOUR
OF IT A QUICK BLUSH PASSED OVER HER FRESH YOUNG FACE AS HOLMES SHOT
ONE OF HIS KEEN QUESTIONING GLANCES AT HER
THANK YOU FOR THIS INFORMATION SAID HE MAY I SEE YOUR FATHER IF
I CALL TOMORROW
I AM AFRAID THE DOCTOR WONT ALLOW IT
THE DOCTOR
YES HAVE YOU NOT HEARD POOR FATHER HAS NEVER BEEN STRONG FOR YEARS
BACK BUT THIS HAS BROKEN HIM DOWN COMPLETELY HE HAS TAKEN TO HIS
BED AND DR WILLOWS SAYS THAT HE IS A WRECK AND THAT HIS NERVOUS
SYSTEM IS SHATTERED MR MCCARTHY WAS THE ONLY MAN ALIVE WHO HAD
KNOWN DAD IN THE OLD DAYS IN VICTORIA
HA IN VICTORIA THAT IS IMPORTANT
YES AT THE MINES
QUITE SO AT THE GOLDMINES WHERE AS I UNDERSTAND MR TURNER MADE
HIS MONEY
YES CERTAINLY
THANK YOU MISS TURNER YOU HAVE BEEN OF MATERIAL ASSISTANCE TO ME
YOU WILL TELL ME IF YOU HAVE ANY NEWS TOMORROW NO DOUBT YOU WILL
GO TO THE PRISON TO SEE JAMES OH IF YOU DO MR HOLMES DO TELL HIM
THAT I KNOW HIM TO BE INNOCENT
I WILL MISS TURNER
I MUST GO HOME NOW FOR DAD IS VERY ILL AND HE MISSES ME SO IF I
LEAVE HIM GOODBYE AND GOD HELP YOU IN YOUR UNDERTAKING SHE
HURRIED FROM THE ROOM AS IMPULSIVELY AS SHE HAD ENTERED AND WE HEARD
THE WHEELS OF HER CARRIAGE RATTLE OFF DOWN THE STREET
I AM ASHAMED OF YOU HOLMES SAID LESTRADE WITH DIGNITY AFTER A FEW
MINUTES SILENCE WHY SHOULD YOU RAISE UP HOPES WHICH YOU ARE BOUND
TO DISAPPOINT I AM NOT OVERTENDER OF HEART BUT I CALL IT CRUEL
I THINK THAT I SEE MY WAY TO CLEARING JAMES MCCARTHY SAID HOLMES
HAVE YOU AN ORDER TO SEE HIM IN PRISON
YES BUT ONLY FOR YOU AND ME
THEN I SHALL RECONSIDER MY RESOLUTION ABOUT GOING OUT WE HAVE STILL
TIME TO TAKE A TRAIN TO HEREFORD AND SEE HIM TONIGHT
AMPLE
THEN LET US DO SO WATSON I FEAR THAT YOU WILL FIND IT VERY SLOW
BUT I SHALL ONLY BE AWAY A COUPLE OF HOURS
I WALKED DOWN TO THE STATION WITH THEM AND THEN WANDERED THROUGH THE
STREETS OF THE LITTLE TOWN FINALLY RETURNING TO THE HOTEL WHERE I
LAY UPON THE SOFA AND TRIED TO INTEREST MYSELF IN A YELLOWBACKED
NOVEL THE PUNY PLOT OF THE STORY WAS SO THIN HOWEVER WHEN COMPARED
TO THE DEEP MYSTERY THROUGH WHICH WE WERE GROPING AND I FOUND MY
ATTENTION WANDER SO CONTINUALLY FROM THE ACTION TO THE FACT THAT I
AT LAST FLUNG IT ACROSS THE ROOM AND GAVE MYSELF UP ENTIRELY TO A
CONSIDERATION OF THE EVENTS OF THE DAY SUPPOSING THAT THIS UNHAPPY
YOUNG MANS STORY WERE ABSOLUTELY TRUE THEN WHAT HELLISH THING WHAT
ABSOLUTELY UNFORESEEN AND EXTRAORDINARY CALAMITY COULD HAVE OCCURRED
BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN HE PARTED FROM HIS FATHER AND THE MOMENT WHEN
DRAWN BACK BY HIS SCREAMS HE RUSHED INTO THE GLADE IT WAS SOMETHING
TERRIBLE AND DEADLY WHAT COULD IT BE MIGHT NOT THE NATURE OF THE
INJURIES REVEAL SOMETHING TO MY MEDICAL INSTINCTS I RANG THE BELL
AND CALLED FOR THE WEEKLY COUNTY PAPER WHICH CONTAINED A VERBATIM
ACCOUNT OF THE INQUEST IN THE SURGEONS DEPOSITION IT WAS STATED
THAT THE POSTERIOR THIRD OF THE LEFT PARIETAL BONE AND THE LEFT HALF
OF THE OCCIPITAL BONE HAD BEEN SHATTERED BY A HEAVY BLOW FROM A BLUNT
WEAPON I MARKED THE SPOT UPON MY OWN HEAD CLEARLY SUCH A BLOW MUST
HAVE BEEN STRUCK FROM BEHIND THAT WAS TO SOME EXTENT IN FAVOUR OF
THE ACCUSED AS WHEN SEEN QUARRELLING HE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH HIS
FATHER STILL IT DID NOT GO FOR VERY MUCH FOR THE OLDER MAN MIGHT
HAVE TURNED HIS BACK BEFORE THE BLOW FELL STILL IT MIGHT BE WORTH
WHILE TO CALL HOLMES ATTENTION TO IT THEN THERE WAS THE PECULIAR
DYING REFERENCE TO A RAT WHAT COULD THAT MEAN IT COULD NOT BE
DELIRIUM A MAN DYING FROM A SUDDEN BLOW DOES NOT COMMONLY BECOME
DELIRIOUS NO IT WAS MORE LIKELY TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN HOW HE
MET HIS FATE BUT WHAT COULD IT INDICATE I CUDGELLED MY BRAINS TO
FIND SOME POSSIBLE EXPLANATION AND THEN THE INCIDENT OF THE GREY
CLOTH SEEN BY YOUNG MCCARTHY IF THAT WERE TRUE THE MURDERER MUST
HAVE DROPPED SOME PART OF HIS DRESS PRESUMABLY HIS OVERCOAT IN HIS
FLIGHT AND MUST HAVE HAD THE HARDIHOOD TO RETURN AND TO CARRY IT
AWAY AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SON WAS KNEELING WITH HIS BACK TURNED
NOT A DOZEN PACES OFF WHAT A TISSUE OF MYSTERIES AND IMPROBABILITIES
THE WHOLE THING WAS I DID NOT WONDER AT LESTRADES OPINION AND YET
I HAD SO MUCH FAITH IN SHERLOCK HOLMES INSIGHT THAT I COULD NOT LOSE
HOPE AS LONG AS EVERY FRESH FACT SEEMED TO STRENGTHEN HIS CONVICTION
OF YOUNG MCCARTHYS INNOCENCE
IT WAS LATE BEFORE SHERLOCK HOLMES RETURNED HE CAME BACK ALONE FOR
LESTRADE WAS STAYING IN LODGINGS IN THE TOWN
THE GLASS STILL KEEPS VERY HIGH HE REMARKED AS HE SAT DOWN IT IS
OF IMPORTANCE THAT IT SHOULD NOT RAIN BEFORE WE ARE ABLE TO GO OVER
THE GROUND ON THE OTHER HAND A MAN SHOULD BE AT HIS VERY BEST AND
KEENEST FOR SUCH NICE WORK AS THAT AND I DID NOT WISH TO DO IT WHEN
FAGGED BY A LONG JOURNEY I HAVE SEEN YOUNG MCCARTHY
AND WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM HIM
NOTHING
COULD HE THROW NO LIGHT
NONE AT ALL I WAS INCLINED TO THINK AT ONE TIME THAT HE KNEW WHO
HAD DONE IT AND WAS SCREENING HIM OR HER BUT I AM CONVINCED NOW THAT
HE IS AS PUZZLED AS EVERYONE ELSE HE IS NOT A VERY QUICKWITTED
YOUTH THOUGH COMELY TO LOOK AT AND I SHOULD THINK SOUND AT HEART
I CANNOT ADMIRE HIS TASTE I REMARKED IF IT IS INDEED A FACT THAT
HE WAS AVERSE TO A MARRIAGE WITH SO CHARMING A YOUNG LADY AS THIS
MISS TURNER
AH THEREBY HANGS A RATHER PAINFUL TALE THIS FELLOW IS MADLY
INSANELY IN LOVE WITH HER BUT SOME TWO YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS ONLY
A LAD AND BEFORE HE REALLY KNEW HER FOR SHE HAD BEEN AWAY FIVE
YEARS AT A BOARDINGSCHOOL WHAT DOES THE IDIOT DO BUT GET INTO THE
CLUTCHES OF A BARMAID IN BRISTOL AND MARRY HER AT A REGISTRY OFFICE
NO ONE KNOWS A WORD OF THE MATTER BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MADDENING
IT MUST BE TO HIM TO BE UPBRAIDED FOR NOT DOING WHAT HE WOULD GIVE
HIS VERY EYES TO DO BUT WHAT HE KNOWS TO BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE
IT WAS SHEER FRENZY OF THIS SORT WHICH MADE HIM THROW HIS HANDS UP
INTO THE AIR WHEN HIS FATHER AT THEIR LAST INTERVIEW WAS GOADING
HIM ON TO PROPOSE TO MISS TURNER ON THE OTHER HAND HE HAD NO MEANS
OF SUPPORTING HIMSELF AND HIS FATHER WHO WAS BY ALL ACCOUNTS A VERY
HARD MAN WOULD HAVE THROWN HIM OVER UTTERLY HAD HE KNOWN THE TRUTH
IT WAS WITH HIS BARMAID WIFE THAT HE HAD SPENT THE LAST THREE DAYS IN
BRISTOL AND HIS FATHER DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS MARK THAT POINT
IT IS OF IMPORTANCE GOOD HAS COME OUT OF EVIL HOWEVER FOR THE
BARMAID FINDING FROM THE PAPERS THAT HE IS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE AND
LIKELY TO BE HANGED HAS THROWN HIM OVER UTTERLY AND HAS WRITTEN TO
HIM TO SAY THAT SHE HAS A HUSBAND ALREADY IN THE BERMUDA DOCKYARD SO
THAT THERE IS REALLY NO TIE BETWEEN THEM I THINK THAT THAT BIT OF
NEWS HAS CONSOLED YOUNG MCCARTHY FOR ALL THAT HE HAS SUFFERED
BUT IF HE IS INNOCENT WHO HAS DONE IT
AH WHO I WOULD CALL YOUR ATTENTION VERY PARTICULARLY TO TWO
POINTS ONE IS THAT THE MURDERED MAN HAD AN APPOINTMENT WITH SOMEONE
AT THE POOL AND THAT THE SOMEONE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HIS SON FOR
HIS SON WAS AWAY AND HE DID NOT KNOW WHEN HE WOULD RETURN THE
SECOND IS THAT THE MURDERED MAN WAS HEARD TO CRY COOEE BEFORE HE
KNEW THAT HIS SON HAD RETURNED THOSE ARE THE CRUCIAL POINTS UPON
WHICH THE CASE DEPENDS AND NOW LET US TALK ABOUT GEORGE MEREDITH IF
YOU PLEASE AND WE SHALL LEAVE ALL MINOR MATTERS UNTIL TOMORROW
THERE WAS NO RAIN AS HOLMES HAD FORETOLD AND THE MORNING BROKE
BRIGHT AND CLOUDLESS AT NINE OCLOCK LESTRADE CALLED FOR US WITH THE
CARRIAGE AND WE SET OFF FOR HATHERLEY FARM AND THE BOSCOMBE POOL
THERE IS SERIOUS NEWS THIS MORNING LESTRADE OBSERVED IT IS SAID
THAT MR TURNER OF THE HALL IS SO ILL THAT HIS LIFE IS DESPAIRED
OF
AN ELDERLY MAN I PRESUME SAID HOLMES
ABOUT SIXTY BUT HIS CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN SHATTERED BY HIS LIFE
ABROAD AND HE HAS BEEN IN FAILING HEALTH FOR SOME TIME THIS
BUSINESS HAS HAD A VERY BAD EFFECT UPON HIM HE WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF
MCCARTHYS AND I MAY ADD A GREAT BENEFACTOR TO HIM FOR I HAVE
LEARNED THAT HE GAVE HIM HATHERLEY FARM RENT FREE
INDEED THAT IS INTERESTING SAID HOLMES
OH YES IN A HUNDRED OTHER WAYS HE HAS HELPED HIM EVERYBODY ABOUT
HERE SPEAKS OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIM
REALLY DOES IT NOT STRIKE YOU AS A LITTLE SINGULAR THAT THIS
MCCARTHY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE HAD LITTLE OF HIS OWN AND TO HAVE BEEN
UNDER SUCH OBLIGATIONS TO TURNER SHOULD STILL TALK OF MARRYING HIS
SON TO TURNERS DAUGHTER WHO IS PRESUMABLY HEIRESS TO THE ESTATE
AND THAT IN SUCH A VERY COCKSURE MANNER AS IF IT WERE MERELY A CASE
OF A PROPOSAL AND ALL ELSE WOULD FOLLOW IT IS THE MORE STRANGE
SINCE WE KNOW THAT TURNER HIMSELF WAS AVERSE TO THE IDEA THE
DAUGHTER TOLD US AS MUCH DO YOU NOT DEDUCE SOMETHING FROM THAT
WE HAVE GOT TO THE DEDUCTIONS AND THE INFERENCES SAID LESTRADE
WINKING AT ME I FIND IT HARD ENOUGH TO TACKLE FACTS HOLMES
WITHOUT FLYING AWAY AFTER THEORIES AND FANCIES
YOU ARE RIGHT SAID HOLMES DEMURELY YOU DO FIND IT VERY HARD TO
TACKLE THE FACTS
ANYHOW I HAVE GRASPED ONE FACT WHICH YOU SEEM TO FIND IT DIFFICULT
TO GET HOLD OF REPLIED LESTRADE WITH SOME WARMTH
AND THAT IS
THAT MCCARTHY SENIOR MET HIS DEATH FROM MCCARTHY JUNIOR AND THAT ALL
THEORIES TO THE CONTRARY ARE THE MEREST MOONSHINE
WELL MOONSHINE IS A BRIGHTER THING THAN FOG SAID HOLMES
LAUGHING BUT I AM VERY MUCH MISTAKEN IF THIS IS NOT HATHERLEY FARM
UPON THE LEFT
YES THAT IS IT IT WAS A WIDESPREAD COMFORTABLELOOKING BUILDING
TWOSTORIED SLATEROOFED WITH GREAT YELLOW BLOTCHES OF LICHEN UPON
THE GREY WALLS THE DRAWN BLINDS AND THE SMOKELESS CHIMNEYS HOWEVER
GAVE IT A STRICKEN LOOK AS THOUGH THE WEIGHT OF THIS HORROR STILL
LAY HEAVY UPON IT WE CALLED AT THE DOOR WHEN THE MAID AT HOLMES
REQUEST SHOWED US THE BOOTS WHICH HER MASTER WORE AT THE TIME OF HIS
DEATH AND ALSO A PAIR OF THE SONS THOUGH NOT THE PAIR WHICH HE HAD
THEN HAD HAVING MEASURED THESE VERY CAREFULLY FROM SEVEN OR EIGHT
DIFFERENT POINTS HOLMES DESIRED TO BE LED TO THE COURTYARD FROM
WHICH WE ALL FOLLOWED THE WINDING TRACK WHICH LED TO BOSCOMBE POOL
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS TRANSFORMED WHEN HE WAS HOT UPON SUCH A SCENT AS
THIS MEN WHO HAD ONLY KNOWN THE QUIET THINKER AND LOGICIAN OF BAKER
STREET WOULD HAVE FAILED TO RECOGNISE HIM HIS FACE FLUSHED AND
DARKENED HIS BROWS WERE DRAWN INTO TWO HARD BLACK LINES WHILE HIS
EYES SHONE OUT FROM BENEATH THEM WITH A STEELY GLITTER HIS FACE WAS
BENT DOWNWARD HIS SHOULDERS BOWED HIS LIPS COMPRESSED AND THE
VEINS STOOD OUT LIKE WHIPCORD IN HIS LONG SINEWY NECK HIS NOSTRILS
SEEMED TO DILATE WITH A PURELY ANIMAL LUST FOR THE CHASE AND HIS
MIND WAS SO ABSOLUTELY CONCENTRATED UPON THE MATTER BEFORE HIM THAT A
QUESTION OR REMARK FELL UNHEEDED UPON HIS EARS OR AT THE MOST ONLY
PROVOKED A QUICK IMPATIENT SNARL IN REPLY SWIFTLY AND SILENTLY HE
MADE HIS WAY ALONG THE TRACK WHICH RAN THROUGH THE MEADOWS AND SO BY
WAY OF THE WOODS TO THE BOSCOMBE POOL IT WAS DAMP MARSHY GROUND AS
IS ALL THAT DISTRICT AND THERE WERE MARKS OF MANY FEET BOTH UPON
THE PATH AND AMID THE SHORT GRASS WHICH BOUNDED IT ON EITHER SIDE
SOMETIMES HOLMES WOULD HURRY ON SOMETIMES STOP DEAD AND ONCE HE
MADE QUITE A LITTLE DETOUR INTO THE MEADOW LESTRADE AND I WALKED
BEHIND HIM THE DETECTIVE INDIFFERENT AND CONTEMPTUOUS WHILE I
WATCHED MY FRIEND WITH THE INTEREST WHICH SPRANG FROM THE CONVICTION
THAT EVERY ONE OF HIS ACTIONS WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS A DEFINITE END
THE BOSCOMBE POOL WHICH IS A LITTLE REEDGIRT SHEET OF WATER SOME
FIFTY YARDS ACROSS IS SITUATED AT THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE HATHERLEY
FARM AND THE PRIVATE PARK OF THE WEALTHY MR TURNER ABOVE THE WOODS
WHICH LINED IT UPON THE FARTHER SIDE WE COULD SEE THE RED JUTTING
PINNACLES WHICH MARKED THE SITE OF THE RICH LANDOWNERS DWELLING ON
THE HATHERLEY SIDE OF THE POOL THE WOODS GREW VERY THICK AND THERE
WAS A NARROW BELT OF SODDEN GRASS TWENTY PACES ACROSS BETWEEN THE
EDGE OF THE TREES AND THE REEDS WHICH LINED THE LAKE LESTRADE SHOWED
US THE EXACT SPOT AT WHICH THE BODY HAD BEEN FOUND AND INDEED SO
MOIST WAS THE GROUND THAT I COULD PLAINLY SEE THE TRACES WHICH HAD
BEEN LEFT BY THE FALL OF THE STRICKEN MAN TO HOLMES AS I COULD SEE
BY HIS EAGER FACE AND PEERING EYES VERY MANY OTHER THINGS WERE TO BE
READ UPON THE TRAMPLED GRASS HE RAN ROUND LIKE A DOG WHO IS PICKING
UP A SCENT AND THEN TURNED UPON MY COMPANION
WHAT DID YOU GO INTO THE POOL FOR HE ASKED
I FISHED ABOUT WITH A RAKE I THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE SOME WEAPON OR
OTHER TRACE BUT HOW ON EARTH
OH TUT TUT I HAVE NO TIME THAT LEFT FOOT OF YOURS WITH ITS
INWARD TWIST IS ALL OVER THE PLACE A MOLE COULD TRACE IT AND THERE
IT VANISHES AMONG THE REEDS OH HOW SIMPLE IT WOULD ALL HAVE BEEN
HAD I BEEN HERE BEFORE THEY CAME LIKE A HERD OF BUFFALO AND WALLOWED
ALL OVER IT HERE IS WHERE THE PARTY WITH THE LODGEKEEPER CAME AND
THEY HAVE COVERED ALL TRACKS FOR SIX OR EIGHT FEET ROUND THE BODY
BUT HERE ARE THREE SEPARATE TRACKS OF THE SAME FEET HE DREW OUT A
LENS AND LAY DOWN UPON HIS WATERPROOF TO HAVE A BETTER VIEW TALKING
ALL THE TIME RATHER TO HIMSELF THAN TO US THESE ARE YOUNG
MCCARTHYS FEET TWICE HE WAS WALKING AND ONCE HE RAN SWIFTLY SO
THAT THE SOLES ARE DEEPLY MARKED AND THE HEELS HARDLY VISIBLE THAT
BEARS OUT HIS STORY HE RAN WHEN HE SAW HIS FATHER ON THE GROUND
THEN HERE ARE THE FATHERS FEET AS HE PACED UP AND DOWN WHAT IS
THIS THEN IT IS THE BUTTEND OF THE GUN AS THE SON STOOD LISTENING
AND THIS HA HA WHAT HAVE WE HERE TIPTOES TIPTOES SQUARE TOO
QUITE UNUSUAL BOOTS THEY COME THEY GO THEY COME AGAINOF COURSE
THAT WAS FOR THE CLOAK NOW WHERE DID THEY COME FROM HE RAN UP AND
DOWN SOMETIMES LOSING SOMETIMES FINDING THE TRACK UNTIL WE WERE
WELL WITHIN THE EDGE OF THE WOOD AND UNDER THE SHADOW OF A GREAT
BEECH THE LARGEST TREE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HOLMES TRACED HIS WAY
TO THE FARTHER SIDE OF THIS AND LAY DOWN ONCE MORE UPON HIS FACE WITH
A LITTLE CRY OF SATISFACTION FOR A LONG TIME HE REMAINED THERE
TURNING OVER THE LEAVES AND DRIED STICKS GATHERING UP WHAT SEEMED TO
ME TO BE DUST INTO AN ENVELOPE AND EXAMINING WITH HIS LENS NOT ONLY
THE GROUND BUT EVEN THE BARK OF THE TREE AS FAR AS HE COULD REACH A
JAGGED STONE WAS LYING AMONG THE MOSS AND THIS ALSO HE CAREFULLY
EXAMINED AND RETAINED THEN HE FOLLOWED A PATHWAY THROUGH THE WOOD
UNTIL HE CAME TO THE HIGHROAD WHERE ALL TRACES WERE LOST
IT HAS BEEN A CASE OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST HE REMARKED RETURNING
TO HIS NATURAL MANNER I FANCY THAT THIS GREY HOUSE ON THE RIGHT
MUST BE THE LODGE I THINK THAT I WILL GO IN AND HAVE A WORD WITH
MORAN AND PERHAPS WRITE A LITTLE NOTE HAVING DONE THAT WE MAY
DRIVE BACK TO OUR LUNCHEON YOU MAY WALK TO THE CAB AND I SHALL BE
WITH YOU PRESENTLY
IT WAS ABOUT TEN MINUTES BEFORE WE REGAINED OUR CAB AND DROVE BACK
INTO ROSS HOLMES STILL CARRYING WITH HIM THE STONE WHICH HE HAD
PICKED UP IN THE WOOD
THIS MAY INTEREST YOU LESTRADE HE REMARKED HOLDING IT OUT THE
MURDER WAS DONE WITH IT
I SEE NO MARKS
THERE ARE NONE
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEN
THE GRASS WAS GROWING UNDER IT IT HAD ONLY LAIN THERE A FEW DAYS
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF A PLACE WHENCE IT HAD BEEN TAKEN IT CORRESPONDS
WITH THE INJURIES THERE IS NO SIGN OF ANY OTHER WEAPON
AND THE MURDERER
IS A TALL MAN LEFTHANDED LIMPS WITH THE RIGHT LEG WEARS
THICKSOLED SHOOTINGBOOTS AND A GREY CLOAK SMOKES INDIAN CIGARS
USES A CIGARHOLDER AND CARRIES A BLUNT PENKNIFE IN HIS POCKET
THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER INDICATIONS BUT THESE MAY BE ENOUGH TO AID
US IN OUR SEARCH
LESTRADE LAUGHED I AM AFRAID THAT I AM STILL A SCEPTIC HE SAID
THEORIES ARE ALL VERY WELL BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH A HARDHEADED
BRITISH JURY
NOUS VERRONS ANSWERED HOLMES CALMLY YOU WORK YOUR OWN METHOD
AND I SHALL WORK MINE I SHALL BE BUSY THIS AFTERNOON AND SHALL
PROBABLY RETURN TO LONDON BY THE EVENING TRAIN
AND LEAVE YOUR CASE UNFINISHED
NO FINISHED
BUT THE MYSTERY
IT IS SOLVED
WHO WAS THE CRIMINAL THEN
THE GENTLEMAN I DESCRIBE
BUT WHO IS HE
SURELY IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT THIS IS NOT SUCH A
POPULOUS NEIGHBOURHOOD
LESTRADE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I AM A PRACTICAL MAN HE SAID
AND I REALLY CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO GO ABOUT THE COUNTRY LOOKING FOR A
LEFTHANDED GENTLEMAN WITH A GAME LEG I SHOULD BECOME THE
LAUGHINGSTOCK OF SCOTLAND YARD
ALL RIGHT SAID HOLMES QUIETLY I HAVE GIVEN YOU THE CHANCE HERE
ARE YOUR LODGINGS GOODBYE I SHALL DROP YOU A LINE BEFORE I LEAVE
HAVING LEFT LESTRADE AT HIS ROOMS WE DROVE TO OUR HOTEL WHERE WE
FOUND LUNCH UPON THE TABLE HOLMES WAS SILENT AND BURIED IN THOUGHT
WITH A PAINED EXPRESSION UPON HIS FACE AS ONE WHO FINDS HIMSELF IN A
PERPLEXING POSITION
LOOK HERE WATSON HE SAID WHEN THE CLOTH WAS CLEARED JUST SIT
DOWN IN THIS CHAIR AND LET ME PREACH TO YOU FOR A LITTLE I DONT
KNOW QUITE WHAT TO DO AND I SHOULD VALUE YOUR ADVICE LIGHT A CIGAR
AND LET ME EXPOUND
PRAY DO SO
WELL NOW IN CONSIDERING THIS CASE THERE ARE TWO POINTS ABOUT YOUNG
MCCARTHYS NARRATIVE WHICH STRUCK US BOTH INSTANTLY ALTHOUGH THEY
IMPRESSED ME IN HIS FAVOUR AND YOU AGAINST HIM ONE WAS THE FACT THAT
HIS FATHER SHOULD ACCORDING TO HIS ACCOUNT CRY COOEE BEFORE
SEEING HIM THE OTHER WAS HIS SINGULAR DYING REFERENCE TO A RAT HE
MUMBLED SEVERAL WORDS YOU UNDERSTAND BUT THAT WAS ALL THAT CAUGHT
THE SONS EAR NOW FROM THIS DOUBLE POINT OUR RESEARCH MUST COMMENCE
AND WE WILL BEGIN IT BY PRESUMING THAT WHAT THE LAD SAYS IS
ABSOLUTELY TRUE
WHAT OF THIS COOEE THEN
WELL OBVIOUSLY IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MEANT FOR THE SON THE SON
AS FAR AS HE KNEW WAS IN BRISTOL IT WAS MERE CHANCE THAT HE WAS
WITHIN EARSHOT THE COOEE WAS MEANT TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF
WHOEVER IT WAS THAT HE HAD THE APPOINTMENT WITH BUT COOEE IS A
DISTINCTLY AUSTRALIAN CRY AND ONE WHICH IS USED BETWEEN AUSTRALIANS
THERE IS A STRONG PRESUMPTION THAT THE PERSON WHOM MCCARTHY EXPECTED
TO MEET HIM AT BOSCOMBE POOL WAS SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN IN AUSTRALIA
WHAT OF THE RAT THEN
SHERLOCK HOLMES TOOK A FOLDED PAPER FROM HIS POCKET AND FLATTENED IT
OUT ON THE TABLE THIS IS A MAP OF THE COLONY OF VICTORIA HE SAID
I WIRED TO BRISTOL FOR IT LAST NIGHT HE PUT HIS HAND OVER PART OF
THE MAP WHAT DO YOU READ
ARAT I READ
AND NOW HE RAISED HIS HAND
BALLARAT
QUITE SO THAT WAS THE WORD THE MAN UTTERED AND OF WHICH HIS SON
ONLY CAUGHT THE LAST TWO SYLLABLES HE WAS TRYING TO UTTER THE NAME
OF HIS MURDERER SO AND SO OF BALLARAT
IT IS WONDERFUL I EXCLAIMED
IT IS OBVIOUS AND NOW YOU SEE I HAD NARROWED THE FIELD DOWN
CONSIDERABLY THE POSSESSION OF A GREY GARMENT WAS A THIRD POINT
WHICH GRANTING THE SONS STATEMENT TO BE CORRECT WAS A CERTAINTY
WE HAVE COME NOW OUT OF MERE VAGUENESS TO THE DEFINITE CONCEPTION OF
AN AUSTRALIAN FROM BALLARAT WITH A GREY CLOAK
CERTAINLY
AND ONE WHO WAS AT HOME IN THE DISTRICT FOR THE POOL CAN ONLY BE
APPROACHED BY THE FARM OR BY THE ESTATE WHERE STRANGERS COULD HARDLY
WANDER
QUITE SO
THEN COMES OUR EXPEDITION OF TODAY BY AN EXAMINATION OF THE GROUND
I GAINED THE TRIFLING DETAILS WHICH I GAVE TO THAT IMBECILE LESTRADE
AS TO THE PERSONALITY OF THE CRIMINAL
BUT HOW DID YOU GAIN THEM
YOU KNOW MY METHOD IT IS FOUNDED UPON THE OBSERVATION OF TRIFLES
HIS HEIGHT I KNOW THAT YOU MIGHT ROUGHLY JUDGE FROM THE LENGTH OF
HIS STRIDE HIS BOOTS TOO MIGHT BE TOLD FROM THEIR TRACES
YES THEY WERE PECULIAR BOOTS
BUT HIS LAMENESS
THE IMPRESSION OF HIS RIGHT FOOT WAS ALWAYS LESS DISTINCT THAN HIS
LEFT HE PUT LESS WEIGHT UPON IT WHY BECAUSE HE LIMPEDHE WAS
LAME
BUT HIS LEFTHANDEDNESS
YOU WERE YOURSELF STRUCK BY THE NATURE OF THE INJURY AS RECORDED BY
THE SURGEON AT THE INQUEST THE BLOW WAS STRUCK FROM IMMEDIATELY
BEHIND AND YET WAS UPON THE LEFT SIDE NOW HOW CAN THAT BE UNLESS
IT WERE BY A LEFTHANDED MAN HE HAD STOOD BEHIND THAT TREE DURING
THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE FATHER AND SON HE HAD EVEN SMOKED THERE I
FOUND THE ASH OF A CIGAR WHICH MY SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OF TOBACCO ASHES
ENABLES ME TO PRONOUNCE AS AN INDIAN CIGAR I HAVE AS YOU KNOW
DEVOTED SOME ATTENTION TO THIS AND WRITTEN A LITTLE MONOGRAPH ON THE
ASHES OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF PIPE CIGAR AND CIGARETTE
TOBACCO HAVING FOUND THE ASH I THEN LOOKED ROUND AND DISCOVERED THE
STUMP AMONG THE MOSS WHERE HE HAD TOSSED IT IT WAS AN INDIAN CIGAR
OF THE VARIETY WHICH ARE ROLLED IN ROTTERDAM
AND THE CIGARHOLDER
I COULD SEE THAT THE END HAD NOT BEEN IN HIS MOUTH THEREFORE HE
USED A HOLDER THE TIP HAD BEEN CUT OFF NOT BITTEN OFF BUT THE CUT
WAS NOT A CLEAN ONE SO I DEDUCED A BLUNT PENKNIFE
HOLMES I SAID YOU HAVE DRAWN A NET ROUND THIS MAN FROM WHICH HE
CANNOT ESCAPE AND YOU HAVE SAVED AN INNOCENT HUMAN LIFE AS TRULY AS
IF YOU HAD CUT THE CORD WHICH WAS HANGING HIM I SEE THE DIRECTION IN
WHICH ALL THIS POINTS THE CULPRIT IS
MR JOHN TURNER CRIED THE HOTEL WAITER OPENING THE DOOR OF OUR
SITTINGROOM AND USHERING IN A VISITOR
THE MAN WHO ENTERED WAS A STRANGE AND IMPRESSIVE FIGURE HIS SLOW
LIMPING STEP AND BOWED SHOULDERS GAVE THE APPEARANCE OF DECREPITUDE
AND YET HIS HARD DEEPLINED CRAGGY FEATURES AND HIS ENORMOUS LIMBS
SHOWED THAT HE WAS POSSESSED OF UNUSUAL STRENGTH OF BODY AND OF
CHARACTER HIS TANGLED BEARD GRIZZLED HAIR AND OUTSTANDING
DROOPING EYEBROWS COMBINED TO GIVE AN AIR OF DIGNITY AND POWER TO HIS
APPEARANCE BUT HIS FACE WAS OF AN ASHEN WHITE WHILE HIS LIPS AND
THE CORNERS OF HIS NOSTRILS WERE TINGED WITH A SHADE OF BLUE IT WAS
CLEAR TO ME AT A GLANCE THAT HE WAS IN THE GRIP OF SOME DEADLY AND
CHRONIC DISEASE
PRAY SIT DOWN ON THE SOFA SAID HOLMES GENTLY YOU HAD MY NOTE
YES THE LODGEKEEPER BROUGHT IT UP YOU SAID THAT YOU WISHED TO SEE
ME HERE TO AVOID SCANDAL
I THOUGHT PEOPLE WOULD TALK IF I WENT TO THE HALL
AND WHY DID YOU WISH TO SEE ME HE LOOKED ACROSS AT MY COMPANION
WITH DESPAIR IN HIS WEARY EYES AS THOUGH HIS QUESTION WAS ALREADY
ANSWERED
YES SAID HOLMES ANSWERING THE LOOK RATHER THAN THE WORDS IT IS
SO I KNOW ALL ABOUT MCCARTHY
THE OLD MAN SANK HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS GOD HELP ME HE CRIED BUT
I WOULD NOT HAVE LET THE YOUNG MAN COME TO HARM I GIVE YOU MY WORD
THAT I WOULD HAVE SPOKEN OUT IF IT WENT AGAINST HIM AT THE ASSIZES
I AM GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY SO SAID HOLMES GRAVELY
I WOULD HAVE SPOKEN NOW HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR MY DEAR GIRL IT WOULD
BREAK HER HEARTIT WILL BREAK HER HEART WHEN SHE HEARS THAT I AM
ARRESTED
IT MAY NOT COME TO THAT SAID HOLMES
WHAT
I AM NO OFFICIAL AGENT I UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS YOUR DAUGHTER WHO
REQUIRED MY PRESENCE HERE AND I AM ACTING IN HER INTERESTS YOUNG
MCCARTHY MUST BE GOT OFF HOWEVER
I AM A DYING MAN SAID OLD TURNER I HAVE HAD DIABETES FOR YEARS
MY DOCTOR SAYS IT IS A QUESTION WHETHER I SHALL LIVE A MONTH YET I
WOULD RATHER DIE UNDER MY OWN ROOF THAN IN A JAIL
HOLMES ROSE AND SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH HIS PEN IN HIS HAND AND A
BUNDLE OF PAPER BEFORE HIM JUST TELL US THE TRUTH HE SAID I
SHALL JOT DOWN THE FACTS YOU WILL SIGN IT AND WATSON HERE CAN
WITNESS IT THEN I COULD PRODUCE YOUR CONFESSION AT THE LAST
EXTREMITY TO SAVE YOUNG MCCARTHY I PROMISE YOU THAT I SHALL NOT USE
IT UNLESS IT IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDED
ITS AS WELL SAID THE OLD MAN ITS A QUESTION WHETHER I SHALL
LIVE TO THE ASSIZES SO IT MATTERS LITTLE TO ME BUT I SHOULD WISH TO
SPARE ALICE THE SHOCK AND NOW I WILL MAKE THE THING CLEAR TO YOU IT
HAS BEEN A LONG TIME IN THE ACTING BUT WILL NOT TAKE ME LONG TO
TELL
YOU DIDNT KNOW THIS DEAD MAN MCCARTHY HE WAS A DEVIL INCARNATE I
TELL YOU THAT GOD KEEP YOU OUT OF THE CLUTCHES OF SUCH A MAN AS HE
HIS GRIP HAS BEEN UPON ME THESE TWENTY YEARS AND HE HAS BLASTED MY
LIFE ILL TELL YOU FIRST HOW I CAME TO BE IN HIS POWER
IT WAS IN THE EARLY S AT THE DIGGINGS I WAS A YOUNG CHAP THEN
HOTBLOODED AND RECKLESS READY TO TURN MY HAND AT ANYTHING I GOT
AMONG BAD COMPANIONS TOOK TO DRINK HAD NO LUCK WITH MY CLAIM TOOK
TO THE BUSH AND IN A WORD BECAME WHAT YOU WOULD CALL OVER HERE A
HIGHWAY ROBBER THERE WERE SIX OF US AND WE HAD A WILD FREE LIFE OF
IT STICKING UP A STATION FROM TIME TO TIME OR STOPPING THE WAGONS
ON THE ROAD TO THE DIGGINGS BLACK JACK OF BALLARAT WAS THE NAME I
WENT UNDER AND OUR PARTY IS STILL REMEMBERED IN THE COLONY AS THE
BALLARAT GANG
ONE DAY A GOLD CONVOY CAME DOWN FROM BALLARAT TO MELBOURNE AND WE
LAY IN WAIT FOR IT AND ATTACKED IT THERE WERE SIX TROOPERS AND SIX
OF US SO IT WAS A CLOSE THING BUT WE EMPTIED FOUR OF THEIR SADDLES
AT THE FIRST VOLLEY THREE OF OUR BOYS WERE KILLED HOWEVER BEFORE
WE GOT THE SWAG I PUT MY PISTOL TO THE HEAD OF THE WAGONDRIVER WHO
WAS THIS VERY MAN MCCARTHY I WISH TO THE LORD THAT I HAD SHOT HIM
THEN BUT I SPARED HIM THOUGH I SAW HIS WICKED LITTLE EYES FIXED ON
MY FACE AS THOUGH TO REMEMBER EVERY FEATURE WE GOT AWAY WITH THE
GOLD BECAME WEALTHY MEN AND MADE OUR WAY OVER TO ENGLAND WITHOUT
BEING SUSPECTED THERE I PARTED FROM MY OLD PALS AND DETERMINED TO
SETTLE DOWN TO A QUIET AND RESPECTABLE LIFE I BOUGHT THIS ESTATE
WHICH CHANCED TO BE IN THE MARKET AND I SET MYSELF TO DO A LITTLE
GOOD WITH MY MONEY TO MAKE UP FOR THE WAY IN WHICH I HAD EARNED IT
I MARRIED TOO AND THOUGH MY WIFE DIED YOUNG SHE LEFT ME MY DEAR
LITTLE ALICE EVEN WHEN SHE WAS JUST A BABY HER WEE HAND SEEMED TO
LEAD ME DOWN THE RIGHT PATH AS NOTHING ELSE HAD EVER DONE IN A WORD
I TURNED OVER A NEW LEAF AND DID MY BEST TO MAKE UP FOR THE PAST ALL
WAS GOING WELL WHEN MCCARTHY LAID HIS GRIP UPON ME
I HAD GONE UP TO TOWN ABOUT AN INVESTMENT AND I MET HIM IN REGENT
STREET WITH HARDLY A COAT TO HIS BACK OR A BOOT TO HIS FOOT
HERE WE ARE JACK SAYS HE TOUCHING ME ON THE ARM WELL BE AS
GOOD AS A FAMILY TO YOU THERES TWO OF US ME AND MY SON AND YOU
CAN HAVE THE KEEPING OF US IF YOU DONTITS A FINE LAWABIDING
COUNTRY IS ENGLAND AND THERES ALWAYS A POLICEMAN WITHIN HAIL
WELL DOWN THEY CAME TO THE WEST COUNTRY THERE WAS NO SHAKING THEM
OFF AND THERE THEY HAVE LIVED RENT FREE ON MY BEST LAND EVER SINCE
THERE WAS NO REST FOR ME NO PEACE NO FORGETFULNESS TURN WHERE I
WOULD THERE WAS HIS CUNNING GRINNING FACE AT MY ELBOW IT GREW
WORSE AS ALICE GREW UP FOR HE SOON SAW I WAS MORE AFRAID OF HER
KNOWING MY PAST THAN OF THE POLICE WHATEVER HE WANTED HE MUST HAVE
AND WHATEVER IT WAS I GAVE HIM WITHOUT QUESTION LAND MONEY HOUSES
UNTIL AT LAST HE ASKED A THING WHICH I COULD NOT GIVE HE ASKED FOR
ALICE
HIS SON YOU SEE HAD GROWN UP AND SO HAD MY GIRL AND AS I WAS
KNOWN TO BE IN WEAK HEALTH IT SEEMED A FINE STROKE TO HIM THAT HIS
LAD SHOULD STEP INTO THE WHOLE PROPERTY BUT THERE I WAS FIRM I
WOULD NOT HAVE HIS CURSED STOCK MIXED WITH MINE NOT THAT I HAD ANY
DISLIKE TO THE LAD BUT HIS BLOOD WAS IN HIM AND THAT WAS ENOUGH I
STOOD FIRM MCCARTHY THREATENED I BRAVED HIM TO DO HIS WORST WE
WERE TO MEET AT THE POOL MIDWAY BETWEEN OUR HOUSES TO TALK IT OVER
WHEN I WENT DOWN THERE I FOUND HIM TALKING WITH HIS SON SO I SMOKED
A CIGAR AND WAITED BEHIND A TREE UNTIL HE SHOULD BE ALONE BUT AS I
LISTENED TO HIS TALK ALL THAT WAS BLACK AND BITTER IN ME SEEMED TO
COME UPPERMOST HE WAS URGING HIS SON TO MARRY MY DAUGHTER WITH AS
LITTLE REGARD FOR WHAT SHE MIGHT THINK AS IF SHE WERE A SLUT FROM OFF
THE STREETS IT DROVE ME MAD TO THINK THAT I AND ALL THAT I HELD MOST
DEAR SHOULD BE IN THE POWER OF SUCH A MAN AS THIS COULD I NOT SNAP
THE BOND I WAS ALREADY A DYING AND A DESPERATE MAN THOUGH CLEAR OF
MIND AND FAIRLY STRONG OF LIMB I KNEW THAT MY OWN FATE WAS SEALED
BUT MY MEMORY AND MY GIRL BOTH COULD BE SAVED IF I COULD BUT SILENCE
THAT FOUL TONGUE I DID IT MR HOLMES I WOULD DO IT AGAIN DEEPLY
AS I HAVE SINNED I HAVE LED A LIFE OF MARTYRDOM TO ATONE FOR IT BUT
THAT MY GIRL SHOULD BE ENTANGLED IN THE SAME MESHES WHICH HELD ME WAS
MORE THAN I COULD SUFFER I STRUCK HIM DOWN WITH NO MORE COMPUNCTION
THAN IF HE HAD BEEN SOME FOUL AND VENOMOUS BEAST HIS CRY BROUGHT
BACK HIS SON BUT I HAD GAINED THE COVER OF THE WOOD THOUGH I WAS
FORCED TO GO BACK TO FETCH THE CLOAK WHICH I HAD DROPPED IN MY
FLIGHT THAT IS THE TRUE STORY GENTLEMEN OF ALL THAT OCCURRED
WELL IT IS NOT FOR ME TO JUDGE YOU SAID HOLMES AS THE OLD MAN
SIGNED THE STATEMENT WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN OUT I PRAY THAT WE MAY
NEVER BE EXPOSED TO SUCH A TEMPTATION
I PRAY NOT SIR AND WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO
IN VIEW OF YOUR HEALTH NOTHING YOU ARE YOURSELF AWARE THAT YOU
WILL SOON HAVE TO ANSWER FOR YOUR DEED AT A HIGHER COURT THAN THE
ASSIZES I WILL KEEP YOUR CONFESSION AND IF MCCARTHY IS CONDEMNED I
SHALL BE FORCED TO USE IT IF NOT IT SHALL NEVER BE SEEN BY MORTAL
EYE AND YOUR SECRET WHETHER YOU BE ALIVE OR DEAD SHALL BE SAFE
WITH US
FAREWELL THEN SAID THE OLD MAN SOLEMNLY YOUR OWN DEATHBEDS
WHEN THEY COME WILL BE THE EASIER FOR THE THOUGHT OF THE PEACE WHICH
YOU HAVE GIVEN TO MINE TOTTERING AND SHAKING IN ALL HIS GIANT
FRAME HE STUMBLED SLOWLY FROM THE ROOM
GOD HELP US SAID HOLMES AFTER A LONG SILENCE WHY DOES FATE PLAY
SUCH TRICKS WITH POOR HELPLESS WORMS I NEVER HEAR OF SUCH A CASE AS
THIS THAT I DO NOT THINK OF BAXTERS WORDS AND SAY THERE BUT FOR
THE GRACE OF GOD GOES SHERLOCK HOLMES
JAMES MCCARTHY WAS ACQUITTED AT THE ASSIZES ON THE STRENGTH OF A
NUMBER OF OBJECTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN OUT BY HOLMES AND SUBMITTED
TO THE DEFENDING COUNSEL OLD TURNER LIVED FOR SEVEN MONTHS AFTER OUR
INTERVIEW BUT HE IS NOW DEAD AND THERE IS EVERY PROSPECT THAT THE
SON AND DAUGHTER MAY COME TO LIVE HAPPILY TOGETHER IN IGNORANCE OF
THE BLACK CLOUD WHICH RESTS UPON THEIR PAST
THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
WHEN I GLANCE OVER MY NOTES AND RECORDS OF THE SHERLOCK HOLMES CASES
BETWEEN THE YEARS AND I AM FACED BY SO MANY WHICH PRESENT
STRANGE AND INTERESTING FEATURES THAT IT IS NO EASY MATTER TO KNOW
WHICH TO CHOOSE AND WHICH TO LEAVE SOME HOWEVER HAVE ALREADY
GAINED PUBLICITY THROUGH THE PAPERS AND OTHERS HAVE NOT OFFERED A
FIELD FOR THOSE PECULIAR QUALITIES WHICH MY FRIEND POSSESSED IN SO
HIGH A DEGREE AND WHICH IT IS THE OBJECT OF THESE PAPERS TO
ILLUSTRATE SOME TOO HAVE BAFFLED HIS ANALYTICAL SKILL AND WOULD
BE AS NARRATIVES BEGINNINGS WITHOUT AN ENDING WHILE OTHERS HAVE
BEEN BUT PARTIALLY CLEARED UP AND HAVE THEIR EXPLANATIONS FOUNDED
RATHER UPON CONJECTURE AND SURMISE THAN ON THAT ABSOLUTE LOGICAL
PROOF WHICH WAS SO DEAR TO HIM THERE IS HOWEVER ONE OF THESE LAST
WHICH WAS SO REMARKABLE IN ITS DETAILS AND SO STARTLING IN ITS
RESULTS THAT I AM TEMPTED TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF IT IN SPITE OF THE
FACT THAT THERE ARE POINTS IN CONNECTION WITH IT WHICH NEVER HAVE
BEEN AND PROBABLY NEVER WILL BE ENTIRELY CLEARED UP
THE YEAR FURNISHED US WITH A LONG SERIES OF CASES OF GREATER OR
LESS INTEREST OF WHICH I RETAIN THE RECORDS AMONG MY HEADINGS UNDER
THIS ONE TWELVE MONTHS I FIND AN ACCOUNT OF THE ADVENTURE OF THE
PARADOL CHAMBER OF THE AMATEUR MENDICANT SOCIETY WHO HELD A
LUXURIOUS CLUB IN THE LOWER VAULT OF A FURNITURE WAREHOUSE OF THE
FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE LOSS OF THE BRITISH BARQUE SOPHY ANDERSON
OF THE SINGULAR ADVENTURES OF THE GRICE PATERSONS IN THE ISLAND OF
UFFA AND FINALLY OF THE CAMBERWELL POISONING CASE IN THE LATTER AS
MAY BE REMEMBERED SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS ABLE BY WINDING UP THE DEAD
MANS WATCH TO PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN WOUND UP TWO HOURS BEFORE AND
THAT THEREFORE THE DECEASED HAD GONE TO BED WITHIN THAT TIMEA
DEDUCTION WHICH WAS OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE IN CLEARING UP THE
CASE ALL THESE I MAY SKETCH OUT AT SOME FUTURE DATE BUT NONE OF
THEM PRESENT SUCH SINGULAR FEATURES AS THE STRANGE TRAIN OF
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH I HAVE NOW TAKEN UP MY PEN TO DESCRIBE
IT WAS IN THE LATTER DAYS OF SEPTEMBER AND THE EQUINOCTIAL GALES HAD
SET IN WITH EXCEPTIONAL VIOLENCE ALL DAY THE WIND HAD SCREAMED AND
THE RAIN HAD BEATEN AGAINST THE WINDOWS SO THAT EVEN HERE IN THE
HEART OF GREAT HANDMADE LONDON WE WERE FORCED TO RAISE OUR MINDS
FOR THE INSTANT FROM THE ROUTINE OF LIFE AND TO RECOGNISE THE
PRESENCE OF THOSE GREAT ELEMENTAL FORCES WHICH SHRIEK AT MANKIND
THROUGH THE BARS OF HIS CIVILISATION LIKE UNTAMED BEASTS IN A CAGE
AS EVENING DREW IN THE STORM GREW HIGHER AND LOUDER AND THE WIND
CRIED AND SOBBED LIKE A CHILD IN THE CHIMNEY SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT
MOODILY AT ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE CROSSINDEXING HIS RECORDS OF
CRIME WHILE I AT THE OTHER WAS DEEP IN ONE OF CLARK RUSSELLS FINE
SEASTORIES UNTIL THE HOWL OF THE GALE FROM WITHOUT SEEMED TO BLEND
WITH THE TEXT AND THE SPLASH OF THE RAIN TO LENGTHEN OUT INTO THE
LONG SWASH OF THE SEA WAVES MY WIFE WAS ON A VISIT TO HER MOTHERS
AND FOR A FEW DAYS I WAS A DWELLER ONCE MORE IN MY OLD QUARTERS AT
BAKER STREET
WHY SAID I GLANCING UP AT MY COMPANION THAT WAS SURELY THE
BELL WHO COULD COME TONIGHT SOME FRIEND OF YOURS PERHAPS
EXCEPT YOURSELF I HAVE NONE HE ANSWERED I DO NOT ENCOURAGE
VISITORS
A CLIENT THEN
IF SO IT IS A SERIOUS CASE NOTHING LESS WOULD BRING A MAN OUT ON
SUCH A DAY AND AT SUCH AN HOUR BUT I TAKE IT THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY
TO BE SOME CRONY OF THE LANDLADYS
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS WRONG IN HIS CONJECTURE HOWEVER FOR THERE CAME
A STEP IN THE PASSAGE AND A TAPPING AT THE DOOR HE STRETCHED OUT HIS
LONG ARM TO TURN THE LAMP AWAY FROM HIMSELF AND TOWARDS THE VACANT
CHAIR UPON WHICH A NEWCOMER MUST SIT
COME IN SAID HE
THE MAN WHO ENTERED WAS YOUNG SOME TWOANDTWENTY AT THE OUTSIDE
WELLGROOMED AND TRIMLY CLAD WITH SOMETHING OF REFINEMENT AND
DELICACY IN HIS BEARING THE STREAMING UMBRELLA WHICH HE HELD IN HIS
HAND AND HIS LONG SHINING WATERPROOF TOLD OF THE FIERCE WEATHER
THROUGH WHICH HE HAD COME HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM ANXIOUSLY IN THE GLARE
OF THE LAMP AND I COULD SEE THAT HIS FACE WAS PALE AND HIS EYES
HEAVY LIKE THOSE OF A MAN WHO IS WEIGHED DOWN WITH SOME GREAT
ANXIETY
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY HE SAID RAISING HIS GOLDEN PINCENEZ TO HIS
EYES I TRUST THAT I AM NOT INTRUDING I FEAR THAT I HAVE BROUGHT
SOME TRACES OF THE STORM AND RAIN INTO YOUR SNUG CHAMBER
GIVE ME YOUR COAT AND UMBRELLA SAID HOLMES THEY MAY REST HERE ON
THE HOOK AND WILL BE DRY PRESENTLY YOU HAVE COME UP FROM THE
SOUTHWEST I SEE
YES FROM HORSHAM
THAT CLAY AND CHALK MIXTURE WHICH I SEE UPON YOUR TOE CAPS IS QUITE
DISTINCTIVE
I HAVE COME FOR ADVICE
THAT IS EASILY GOT
AND HELP
THAT IS NOT ALWAYS SO EASY
I HAVE HEARD OF YOU MR HOLMES I HEARD FROM MAJOR PRENDERGAST HOW
YOU SAVED HIM IN THE TANKERVILLE CLUB SCANDAL
AH OF COURSE HE WAS WRONGFULLY ACCUSED OF CHEATING AT CARDS
HE SAID THAT YOU COULD SOLVE ANYTHING
HE SAID TOO MUCH
THAT YOU ARE NEVER BEATEN
I HAVE BEEN BEATEN FOUR TIMESTHREE TIMES BY MEN AND ONCE BY A
WOMAN
BUT WHAT IS THAT COMPARED WITH THE NUMBER OF YOUR SUCCESSES
IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE BEEN GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL
THEN YOU MAY BE SO WITH ME
I BEG THAT YOU WILL DRAW YOUR CHAIR UP TO THE FIRE AND FAVOUR ME
WITH SOME DETAILS AS TO YOUR CASE
IT IS NO ORDINARY ONE
NONE OF THOSE WHICH COME TO ME ARE I AM THE LAST COURT OF APPEAL
AND YET I QUESTION SIR WHETHER IN ALL YOUR EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE
EVER LISTENED TO A MORE MYSTERIOUS AND INEXPLICABLE CHAIN OF EVENTS
THAN THOSE WHICH HAVE HAPPENED IN MY OWN FAMILY
YOU FILL ME WITH INTEREST SAID HOLMES PRAY GIVE US THE ESSENTIAL
FACTS FROM THE COMMENCEMENT AND I CAN AFTERWARDS QUESTION YOU AS TO
THOSE DETAILS WHICH SEEM TO ME TO BE MOST IMPORTANT
THE YOUNG MAN PULLED HIS CHAIR UP AND PUSHED HIS WET FEET OUT TOWARDS
THE BLAZE
MY NAME SAID HE IS JOHN OPENSHAW BUT MY OWN AFFAIRS HAVE AS
FAR AS I CAN UNDERSTAND LITTLE TO DO WITH THIS AWFUL BUSINESS IT IS
A HEREDITARY MATTER SO IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE FACTS I
MUST GO BACK TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE AFFAIR
YOU MUST KNOW THAT MY GRANDFATHER HAD TWO SONSMY UNCLE ELIAS AND
MY FATHER JOSEPH MY FATHER HAD A SMALL FACTORY AT COVENTRY WHICH HE
ENLARGED AT THE TIME OF THE INVENTION OF BICYCLING HE WAS A PATENTEE
OF THE OPENSHAW UNBREAKABLE TIRE AND HIS BUSINESS MET WITH SUCH
SUCCESS THAT HE WAS ABLE TO SELL IT AND TO RETIRE UPON A HANDSOME
COMPETENCE
MY UNCLE ELIAS EMIGRATED TO AMERICA WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN AND
BECAME A PLANTER IN FLORIDA WHERE HE WAS REPORTED TO HAVE DONE VERY
WELL AT THE TIME OF THE WAR HE FOUGHT IN JACKSONS ARMY AND
AFTERWARDS UNDER HOOD WHERE HE ROSE TO BE A COLONEL WHEN LEE LAID
DOWN HIS ARMS MY UNCLE RETURNED TO HIS PLANTATION WHERE HE REMAINED
FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS ABOUT OR HE CAME BACK TO EUROPE
AND TOOK A SMALL ESTATE IN SUSSEX NEAR HORSHAM HE HAD MADE A VERY
CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE IN THE STATES AND HIS REASON FOR LEAVING THEM
WAS HIS AVERSION TO THE NEGROES AND HIS DISLIKE OF THE REPUBLICAN
POLICY IN EXTENDING THE FRANCHISE TO THEM HE WAS A SINGULAR MAN
FIERCE AND QUICKTEMPERED VERY FOULMOUTHED WHEN HE WAS ANGRY AND
OF A MOST RETIRING DISPOSITION DURING ALL THE YEARS THAT HE LIVED AT
HORSHAM I DOUBT IF EVER HE SET FOOT IN THE TOWN HE HAD A GARDEN AND
TWO OR THREE FIELDS ROUND HIS HOUSE AND THERE HE WOULD TAKE HIS
EXERCISE THOUGH VERY OFTEN FOR WEEKS ON END HE WOULD NEVER LEAVE HIS
ROOM HE DRANK A GREAT DEAL OF BRANDY AND SMOKED VERY HEAVILY BUT HE
WOULD SEE NO SOCIETY AND DID NOT WANT ANY FRIENDS NOT EVEN HIS OWN
BROTHER
HE DIDNT MIND ME IN FACT HE TOOK A FANCY TO ME FOR AT THE TIME
WHEN HE SAW ME FIRST I WAS A YOUNGSTER OF TWELVE OR SO THIS WOULD BE
IN THE YEAR AFTER HE HAD BEEN EIGHT OR NINE YEARS IN ENGLAND
HE BEGGED MY FATHER TO LET ME LIVE WITH HIM AND HE WAS VERY KIND TO
ME IN HIS WAY WHEN HE WAS SOBER HE USED TO BE FOND OF PLAYING
BACKGAMMON AND DRAUGHTS WITH ME AND HE WOULD MAKE ME HIS
REPRESENTATIVE BOTH WITH THE SERVANTS AND WITH THE TRADESPEOPLE SO
THAT BY THE TIME THAT I WAS SIXTEEN I WAS QUITE MASTER OF THE HOUSE
I KEPT ALL THE KEYS AND COULD GO WHERE I LIKED AND DO WHAT I LIKED
SO LONG AS I DID NOT DISTURB HIM IN HIS PRIVACY THERE WAS ONE
SINGULAR EXCEPTION HOWEVER FOR HE HAD A SINGLE ROOM A LUMBERROOM
UP AMONG THE ATTICS WHICH WAS INVARIABLY LOCKED AND WHICH HE WOULD
NEVER PERMIT EITHER ME OR ANYONE ELSE TO ENTER WITH A BOYS
CURIOSITY I HAVE PEEPED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE BUT I WAS NEVER ABLE TO
SEE MORE THAN SUCH A COLLECTION OF OLD TRUNKS AND BUNDLES AS WOULD BE
EXPECTED IN SUCH A ROOM
ONE DAYIT WAS IN MARCH A LETTER WITH A FOREIGN STAMP LAY
UPON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF THE COLONELS PLATE IT WAS NOT A COMMON
THING FOR HIM TO RECEIVE LETTERS FOR HIS BILLS WERE ALL PAID IN
READY MONEY AND HE HAD NO FRIENDS OF ANY SORT FROM INDIA SAID HE
AS HE TOOK IT UP PONDICHERRY POSTMARK WHAT CAN THIS BE OPENING
IT HURRIEDLY OUT THERE JUMPED FIVE LITTLE DRIED ORANGE PIPS WHICH
PATTERED DOWN UPON HIS PLATE I BEGAN TO LAUGH AT THIS BUT THE LAUGH
WAS STRUCK FROM MY LIPS AT THE SIGHT OF HIS FACE HIS LIP HAD FALLEN
HIS EYES WERE PROTRUDING HIS SKIN THE COLOUR OF PUTTY AND HE GLARED
AT THE ENVELOPE WHICH HE STILL HELD IN HIS TREMBLING HAND K K
K HE SHRIEKED AND THEN MY GOD MY GOD MY SINS HAVE OVERTAKEN
ME
WHAT IS IT UNCLE I CRIED
DEATH SAID HE AND RISING FROM THE TABLE HE RETIRED TO HIS ROOM
LEAVING ME PALPITATING WITH HORROR I TOOK UP THE ENVELOPE AND SAW
SCRAWLED IN RED INK UPON THE INNER FLAP JUST ABOVE THE GUM THE
LETTER K THREE TIMES REPEATED THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE SAVE THE FIVE
DRIED PIPS WHAT COULD BE THE REASON OF HIS OVERPOWERING TERROR I
LEFT THE BREAKFASTTABLE AND AS I ASCENDED THE STAIR I MET HIM
COMING DOWN WITH AN OLD RUSTY KEY WHICH MUST HAVE BELONGED TO THE
ATTIC IN ONE HAND AND A SMALL BRASS BOX LIKE A CASHBOX IN THE
OTHER
THEY MAY DO WHAT THEY LIKE BUT ILL CHECKMATE THEM STILL SAID HE
WITH AN OATH TELL MARY THAT I SHALL WANT A FIRE IN MY ROOM TODAY
AND SEND DOWN TO FORDHAM THE HORSHAM LAWYER
I DID AS HE ORDERED AND WHEN THE LAWYER ARRIVED I WAS ASKED TO STEP
UP TO THE ROOM THE FIRE WAS BURNING BRIGHTLY AND IN THE GRATE THERE
WAS A MASS OF BLACK FLUFFY ASHES AS OF BURNED PAPER WHILE THE
BRASS BOX STOOD OPEN AND EMPTY BESIDE IT AS I GLANCED AT THE BOX I
NOTICED WITH A START THAT UPON THE LID WAS PRINTED THE TREBLE K
WHICH I HAD READ IN THE MORNING UPON THE ENVELOPE
I WISH YOU JOHN SAID MY UNCLE TO WITNESS MY WILL I LEAVE MY
ESTATE WITH ALL ITS ADVANTAGES AND ALL ITS DISADVANTAGES TO MY
BROTHER YOUR FATHER WHENCE IT WILL NO DOUBT DESCEND TO YOU IF
YOU CAN ENJOY IT IN PEACE WELL AND GOOD IF YOU FIND YOU CANNOT
TAKE MY ADVICE MY BOY AND LEAVE IT TO YOUR DEADLIEST ENEMY I AM
SORRY TO GIVE YOU SUCH A TWOEDGED THING BUT I CANT SAY WHAT TURN
THINGS ARE GOING TO TAKE KINDLY SIGN THE PAPER WHERE MR FORDHAM
SHOWS YOU
I SIGNED THE PAPER AS DIRECTED AND THE LAWYER TOOK IT AWAY WITH
HIM THE SINGULAR INCIDENT MADE AS YOU MAY THINK THE DEEPEST
IMPRESSION UPON ME AND I PONDERED OVER IT AND TURNED IT EVERY WAY IN
MY MIND WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO MAKE ANYTHING OF IT YET I COULD NOT
SHAKE OFF THE VAGUE FEELING OF DREAD WHICH IT LEFT BEHIND THOUGH THE
SENSATION GREW LESS KEEN AS THE WEEKS PASSED AND NOTHING HAPPENED TO
DISTURB THE USUAL ROUTINE OF OUR LIVES I COULD SEE A CHANGE IN MY
UNCLE HOWEVER HE DRANK MORE THAN EVER AND HE WAS LESS INCLINED FOR
ANY SORT OF SOCIETY MOST OF HIS TIME HE WOULD SPEND IN HIS ROOM
WITH THE DOOR LOCKED UPON THE INSIDE BUT SOMETIMES HE WOULD EMERGE
IN A SORT OF DRUNKEN FRENZY AND WOULD BURST OUT OF THE HOUSE AND TEAR
ABOUT THE GARDEN WITH A REVOLVER IN HIS HAND SCREAMING OUT THAT HE
WAS AFRAID OF NO MAN AND THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE COOPED UP LIKE A
SHEEP IN A PEN BY MAN OR DEVIL WHEN THESE HOT FITS WERE OVER
HOWEVER HE WOULD RUSH TUMULTUOUSLY IN AT THE DOOR AND LOCK AND BAR
IT BEHIND HIM LIKE A MAN WHO CAN BRAZEN IT OUT NO LONGER AGAINST THE
TERROR WHICH LIES AT THE ROOTS OF HIS SOUL AT SUCH TIMES I HAVE SEEN
HIS FACE EVEN ON A COLD DAY GLISTEN WITH MOISTURE AS THOUGH IT
WERE NEW RAISED FROM A BASIN
WELL TO COME TO AN END OF THE MATTER MR HOLMES AND NOT TO ABUSE
YOUR PATIENCE THERE CAME A NIGHT WHEN HE MADE ONE OF THOSE DRUNKEN
SALLIES FROM WHICH HE NEVER CAME BACK WE FOUND HIM WHEN WE WENT TO
SEARCH FOR HIM FACE DOWNWARD IN A LITTLE GREENSCUMMED POOL WHICH
LAY AT THE FOOT OF THE GARDEN THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY VIOLENCE AND
THE WATER WAS BUT TWO FEET DEEP SO THAT THE JURY HAVING REGARD TO
HIS KNOWN ECCENTRICITY BROUGHT IN A VERDICT OF SUICIDE BUT I WHO
KNEW HOW HE WINCED FROM THE VERY THOUGHT OF DEATH HAD MUCH ADO TO
PERSUADE MYSELF THAT HE HAD GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO MEET IT THE
MATTER PASSED HOWEVER AND MY FATHER ENTERED INTO POSSESSION OF THE
ESTATE AND OF SOME WHICH LAY TO HIS CREDIT AT THE BANK
ONE MOMENT HOLMES INTERPOSED YOUR STATEMENT IS I FORESEE ONE
OF THE MOST REMARKABLE TO WHICH I HAVE EVER LISTENED LET ME HAVE THE
DATE OF THE RECEPTION BY YOUR UNCLE OF THE LETTER AND THE DATE OF
HIS SUPPOSED SUICIDE
THE LETTER ARRIVED ON MARCH HIS DEATH WAS SEVEN WEEKS
LATER UPON THE NIGHT OF MAY ND
THANK YOU PRAY PROCEED
WHEN MY FATHER TOOK OVER THE HORSHAM PROPERTY HE AT MY REQUEST
MADE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ATTIC WHICH HAD BEEN ALWAYS LOCKED
UP WE FOUND THE BRASS BOX THERE ALTHOUGH ITS CONTENTS HAD BEEN
DESTROYED ON THE INSIDE OF THE COVER WAS A PAPER LABEL WITH THE
INITIALS OF K K K REPEATED UPON IT AND LETTERS MEMORANDA
RECEIPTS AND A REGISTER WRITTEN BENEATH THESE WE PRESUME
INDICATED THE NATURE OF THE PAPERS WHICH HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY
COLONEL OPENSHAW FOR THE REST THERE WAS NOTHING OF MUCH IMPORTANCE
IN THE ATTIC SAVE A GREAT MANY SCATTERED PAPERS AND NOTEBOOKS
BEARING UPON MY UNCLES LIFE IN AMERICA SOME OF THEM WERE OF THE WAR
TIME AND SHOWED THAT HE HAD DONE HIS DUTY WELL AND HAD BORNE THE
REPUTE OF A BRAVE SOLDIER OTHERS WERE OF A DATE DURING THE
RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SOUTHERN STATES AND WERE MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH
POLITICS FOR HE HAD EVIDENTLY TAKEN A STRONG PART IN OPPOSING THE
CARPETBAG POLITICIANS WHO HAD BEEN SENT DOWN FROM THE NORTH
WELL IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF WHEN MY FATHER CAME TO LIVE AT
HORSHAM AND ALL WENT AS WELL AS POSSIBLE WITH US UNTIL THE JANUARY
OF ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER THE NEW YEAR I HEARD MY FATHER GIVE A
SHARP CRY OF SURPRISE AS WE SAT TOGETHER AT THE BREAKFASTTABLE
THERE HE WAS SITTING WITH A NEWLY OPENED ENVELOPE IN ONE HAND AND
FIVE DRIED ORANGE PIPS IN THE OUTSTRETCHED PALM OF THE OTHER ONE HE
HAD ALWAYS LAUGHED AT WHAT HE CALLED MY COCKANDBULL STORY ABOUT THE
COLONEL BUT HE LOOKED VERY SCARED AND PUZZLED NOW THAT THE SAME
THING HAD COME UPON HIMSELF
WHY WHAT ON EARTH DOES THIS MEAN JOHN HE STAMMERED
MY HEART HAD TURNED TO LEAD IT IS K K K SAID I
HE LOOKED INSIDE THE ENVELOPE SO IT IS HE CRIED HERE ARE THE
VERY LETTERS BUT WHAT IS THIS WRITTEN ABOVE THEM
PUT THE PAPERS ON THE SUNDIAL I READ PEEPING OVER HIS SHOULDER
WHAT PAPERS WHAT SUNDIAL HE ASKED
THE SUNDIAL IN THE GARDEN THERE IS NO OTHER SAID I BUT THE
PAPERS MUST BE THOSE THAT ARE DESTROYED
POOH SAID HE GRIPPING HARD AT HIS COURAGE WE ARE IN A
CIVILISED LAND HERE AND WE CANT HAVE TOMFOOLERY OF THIS KIND WHERE
DOES THE THING COME FROM
FROM DUNDEE I ANSWERED GLANCING AT THE POSTMARK
SOME PREPOSTEROUS PRACTICAL JOKE SAID HE WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH
SUNDIALS AND PAPERS I SHALL TAKE NO NOTICE OF SUCH NONSENSE
I SHOULD CERTAINLY SPEAK TO THE POLICE I SAID
AND BE LAUGHED AT FOR MY PAINS NOTHING OF THE SORT
THEN LET ME DO SO
NO I FORBID YOU I WONT HAVE A FUSS MADE ABOUT SUCH NONSENSE
IT WAS IN VAIN TO ARGUE WITH HIM FOR HE WAS A VERY OBSTINATE MAN I
WENT ABOUT HOWEVER WITH A HEART WHICH WAS FULL OF FOREBODINGS
ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER THE COMING OF THE LETTER MY FATHER WENT FROM
HOME TO VISIT AN OLD FRIEND OF HIS MAJOR FREEBODY WHO IS IN COMMAND
OF ONE OF THE FORTS UPON PORTSDOWN HILL I WAS GLAD THAT HE SHOULD
GO FOR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE WAS FARTHER FROM DANGER WHEN HE WAS
AWAY FROM HOME IN THAT HOWEVER I WAS IN ERROR UPON THE SECOND DAY
OF HIS ABSENCE I RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM THE MAJOR IMPLORING ME TO
COME AT ONCE MY FATHER HAD FALLEN OVER ONE OF THE DEEP CHALKPITS
WHICH ABOUND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND WAS LYING SENSELESS WITH A
SHATTERED SKULL I HURRIED TO HIM BUT HE PASSED AWAY WITHOUT HAVING
EVER RECOVERED HIS CONSCIOUSNESS HE HAD AS IT APPEARS BEEN
RETURNING FROM FAREHAM IN THE TWILIGHT AND AS THE COUNTRY WAS
UNKNOWN TO HIM AND THE CHALKPIT UNFENCED THE JURY HAD NO
HESITATION IN BRINGING IN A VERDICT OF DEATH FROM ACCIDENTAL
CAUSES CAREFULLY AS I EXAMINED EVERY FACT CONNECTED WITH HIS DEATH
I WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING WHICH COULD SUGGEST THE IDEA OF MURDER
THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF VIOLENCE NO FOOTMARKS NO ROBBERY NO RECORD
OF STRANGERS HAVING BEEN SEEN UPON THE ROADS AND YET I NEED NOT TELL
YOU THAT MY MIND WAS FAR FROM AT EASE AND THAT I WAS WELLNIGH
CERTAIN THAT SOME FOUL PLOT HAD BEEN WOVEN ROUND HIM
IN THIS SINISTER WAY I CAME INTO MY INHERITANCE YOU WILL ASK ME WHY
I DID NOT DISPOSE OF IT I ANSWER BECAUSE I WAS WELL CONVINCED THAT
OUR TROUBLES WERE IN SOME WAY DEPENDENT UPON AN INCIDENT IN MY
UNCLES LIFE AND THAT THE DANGER WOULD BE AS PRESSING IN ONE HOUSE
AS IN ANOTHER
IT WAS IN JANUARY THAT MY POOR FATHER MET HIS END AND TWO
YEARS AND EIGHT MONTHS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THEN DURING THAT TIME I
HAVE LIVED HAPPILY AT HORSHAM AND I HAD BEGUN TO HOPE THAT THIS
CURSE HAD PASSED AWAY FROM THE FAMILY AND THAT IT HAD ENDED WITH THE
LAST GENERATION I HAD BEGUN TO TAKE COMFORT TOO SOON HOWEVER
YESTERDAY MORNING THE BLOW FELL IN THE VERY SHAPE IN WHICH IT HAD
COME UPON MY FATHER
THE YOUNG MAN TOOK FROM HIS WAISTCOAT A CRUMPLED ENVELOPE AND
TURNING TO THE TABLE HE SHOOK OUT UPON IT FIVE LITTLE DRIED ORANGE
PIPS
THIS IS THE ENVELOPE HE CONTINUED THE POSTMARK IS
LONDONEASTERN DIVISION WITHIN ARE THE VERY WORDS WHICH WERE UPON
MY FATHERS LAST MESSAGE K K K AND THEN PUT THE PAPERS ON THE
SUNDIAL
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ASKED HOLMES
NOTHING
NOTHING
TO TELL THE TRUTHHE SANK HIS FACE INTO HIS THIN WHITE HANDSI
HAVE FELT HELPLESS I HAVE FELT LIKE ONE OF THOSE POOR RABBITS WHEN
THE SNAKE IS WRITHING TOWARDS IT I SEEM TO BE IN THE GRASP OF SOME
RESISTLESS INEXORABLE EVIL WHICH NO FORESIGHT AND NO PRECAUTIONS
CAN GUARD AGAINST
TUT TUT CRIED SHERLOCK HOLMES YOU MUST ACT MAN OR YOU ARE
LOST NOTHING BUT ENERGY CAN SAVE YOU THIS IS NO TIME FOR DESPAIR
I HAVE SEEN THE POLICE
AH
BUT THEY LISTENED TO MY STORY WITH A SMILE I AM CONVINCED THAT THE
INSPECTOR HAS FORMED THE OPINION THAT THE LETTERS ARE ALL PRACTICAL
JOKES AND THAT THE DEATHS OF MY RELATIONS WERE REALLY ACCIDENTS AS
THE JURY STATED AND WERE NOT TO BE CONNECTED WITH THE WARNINGS
HOLMES SHOOK HIS CLENCHED HANDS IN THE AIR INCREDIBLE IMBECILITY
HE CRIED
THEY HAVE HOWEVER ALLOWED ME A POLICEMAN WHO MAY REMAIN IN THE
HOUSE WITH ME
HAS HE COME WITH YOU TONIGHT
NO HIS ORDERS WERE TO STAY IN THE HOUSE
AGAIN HOLMES RAVED IN THE AIR
WHY DID YOU COME TO ME HE CRIED AND ABOVE ALL WHY DID YOU NOT
COME AT ONCE
I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS ONLY TODAY THAT I SPOKE TO MAJOR PRENDERGAST
ABOUT MY TROUBLES AND WAS ADVISED BY HIM TO COME TO YOU
IT IS REALLY TWO DAYS SINCE YOU HAD THE LETTER WE SHOULD HAVE ACTED
BEFORE THIS YOU HAVE NO FURTHER EVIDENCE I SUPPOSE THAN THAT WHICH
YOU HAVE PLACED BEFORE USNO SUGGESTIVE DETAIL WHICH MIGHT HELP US
THERE IS ONE THING SAID JOHN OPENSHAW HE RUMMAGED IN HIS COAT
POCKET AND DRAWING OUT A PIECE OF DISCOLOURED BLUETINTED PAPER
HE LAID IT OUT UPON THE TABLE I HAVE SOME REMEMBRANCE SAID HE
THAT ON THE DAY WHEN MY UNCLE BURNED THE PAPERS I OBSERVED THAT THE
SMALL UNBURNED MARGINS WHICH LAY AMID THE ASHES WERE OF THIS
PARTICULAR COLOUR I FOUND THIS SINGLE SHEET UPON THE FLOOR OF HIS
ROOM AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT IT MAY BE ONE OF THE PAPERS
WHICH HAS PERHAPS FLUTTERED OUT FROM AMONG THE OTHERS AND IN THAT
WAY HAS ESCAPED DESTRUCTION BEYOND THE MENTION OF PIPS I DO NOT SEE
THAT IT HELPS US MUCH I THINK MYSELF THAT IT IS A PAGE FROM SOME
PRIVATE DIARY THE WRITING IS UNDOUBTEDLY MY UNCLES
HOLMES MOVED THE LAMP AND WE BOTH BENT OVER THE SHEET OF PAPER
WHICH SHOWED BY ITS RAGGED EDGE THAT IT HAD INDEED BEEN TORN FROM A
BOOK IT WAS HEADED MARCH AND BENEATH WERE THE FOLLOWING
ENIGMATICAL NOTICES
TH HUDSON CAME SAME OLD PLATFORM
TH SET THE PIPS ON MCCAULEY PARAMORE AND JOHN SWAIN OF ST
AUGUSTINE
TH MCCAULEY CLEARED
TH JOHN SWAIN CLEARED
TH VISITED PARAMORE ALL WELL
THANK YOU SAID HOLMES FOLDING UP THE PAPER AND RETURNING IT TO
OUR VISITOR AND NOW YOU MUST ON NO ACCOUNT LOSE ANOTHER INSTANT WE
CANNOT SPARE TIME EVEN TO DISCUSS WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME YOU MUST GET
HOME INSTANTLY AND ACT
WHAT SHALL I DO
THERE IS BUT ONE THING TO DO IT MUST BE DONE AT ONCE YOU MUST PUT
THIS PIECE OF PAPER WHICH YOU HAVE SHOWN US INTO THE BRASS BOX WHICH
YOU HAVE DESCRIBED YOU MUST ALSO PUT IN A NOTE TO SAY THAT ALL THE
OTHER PAPERS WERE BURNED BY YOUR UNCLE AND THAT THIS IS THE ONLY ONE
WHICH REMAINS YOU MUST ASSERT THAT IN SUCH WORDS AS WILL CARRY
CONVICTION WITH THEM HAVING DONE THIS YOU MUST AT ONCE PUT THE BOX
OUT UPON THE SUNDIAL AS DIRECTED DO YOU UNDERSTAND
ENTIRELY
DO NOT THINK OF REVENGE OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT AT PRESENT I
THINK THAT WE MAY GAIN THAT BY MEANS OF THE LAW BUT WE HAVE OUR WEB
TO WEAVE WHILE THEIRS IS ALREADY WOVEN THE FIRST CONSIDERATION IS
TO REMOVE THE PRESSING DANGER WHICH THREATENS YOU THE SECOND IS TO
CLEAR UP THE MYSTERY AND TO PUNISH THE GUILTY PARTIES
I THANK YOU SAID THE YOUNG MAN RISING AND PULLING ON HIS
OVERCOAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME FRESH LIFE AND HOPE I SHALL CERTAINLY
DO AS YOU ADVISE
DO NOT LOSE AN INSTANT AND ABOVE ALL TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF IN THE
MEANWHILE FOR I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE CAN BE A DOUBT THAT YOU ARE
THREATENED BY A VERY REAL AND IMMINENT DANGER HOW DO YOU GO BACK
BY TRAIN FROM WATERLOO
IT IS NOT YET NINE THE STREETS WILL BE CROWDED SO I TRUST THAT YOU
MAY BE IN SAFETY AND YET YOU CANNOT GUARD YOURSELF TOO CLOSELY
I AM ARMED
THAT IS WELL TOMORROW I SHALL SET TO WORK UPON YOUR CASE
I SHALL SEE YOU AT HORSHAM THEN
NO YOUR SECRET LIES IN LONDON IT IS THERE THAT I SHALL SEEK IT
THEN I SHALL CALL UPON YOU IN A DAY OR IN TWO DAYS WITH NEWS AS TO
THE BOX AND THE PAPERS I SHALL TAKE YOUR ADVICE IN EVERY
PARTICULAR HE SHOOK HANDS WITH US AND TOOK HIS LEAVE OUTSIDE THE
WIND STILL SCREAMED AND THE RAIN SPLASHED AND PATTERED AGAINST THE
WINDOWS THIS STRANGE WILD STORY SEEMED TO HAVE COME TO US FROM AMID
THE MAD ELEMENTSBLOWN IN UPON US LIKE A SHEET OF SEAWEED IN A
GALEAND NOW TO HAVE BEEN REABSORBED BY THEM ONCE MORE
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE WITH HIS HEAD SUNK
FORWARD AND HIS EYES BENT UPON THE RED GLOW OF THE FIRE THEN HE LIT
HIS PIPE AND LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR HE WATCHED THE BLUE
SMOKERINGS AS THEY CHASED EACH OTHER UP TO THE CEILING
I THINK WATSON HE REMARKED AT LAST THAT OF ALL OUR CASES WE
HAVE HAD NONE MORE FANTASTIC THAN THIS
SAVE PERHAPS THE SIGN OF FOUR
WELL YES SAVE PERHAPS THAT AND YET THIS JOHN OPENSHAW SEEMS TO
ME TO BE WALKING AMID EVEN GREATER PERILS THAN DID THE SHOLTOS
BUT HAVE YOU I ASKED FORMED ANY DEFINITE CONCEPTION AS TO WHAT
THESE PERILS ARE
THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION AS TO THEIR NATURE HE ANSWERED
THEN WHAT ARE THEY WHO IS THIS K K K AND WHY DOES HE PURSUE
THIS UNHAPPY FAMILY
SHERLOCK HOLMES CLOSED HIS EYES AND PLACED HIS ELBOWS UPON THE ARMS
OF HIS CHAIR WITH HIS FINGERTIPS TOGETHER THE IDEAL REASONER HE
REMARKED WOULD WHEN HE HAD ONCE BEEN SHOWN A SINGLE FACT IN ALL
ITS BEARINGS DEDUCE FROM IT NOT ONLY ALL THE CHAIN OF EVENTS WHICH
LED UP TO IT BUT ALSO ALL THE RESULTS WHICH WOULD FOLLOW FROM IT AS
CUVIER COULD CORRECTLY DESCRIBE A WHOLE ANIMAL BY THE CONTEMPLATION
OF A SINGLE BONE SO THE OBSERVER WHO HAS THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD ONE
LINK IN A SERIES OF INCIDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY STATE ALL
THE OTHER ONES BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER WE HAVE NOT YET GRASPED THE
RESULTS WHICH THE REASON ALONE CAN ATTAIN TO PROBLEMS MAY BE SOLVED
IN THE STUDY WHICH HAVE BAFFLED ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT A SOLUTION
BY THE AID OF THEIR SENSES TO CARRY THE ART HOWEVER TO ITS HIGHEST
PITCH IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE REASONER SHOULD BE ABLE TO UTILISE
ALL THE FACTS WHICH HAVE COME TO HIS KNOWLEDGE AND THIS IN ITSELF
IMPLIES AS YOU WILL READILY SEE A POSSESSION OF ALL KNOWLEDGE
WHICH EVEN IN THESE DAYS OF FREE EDUCATION AND ENCYCLOPAEDIAS IS A
SOMEWHAT RARE ACCOMPLISHMENT IT IS NOT SO IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER THAT
A MAN SHOULD POSSESS ALL KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE USEFUL TO
HIM IN HIS WORK AND THIS I HAVE ENDEAVOURED IN MY CASE TO DO IF I
REMEMBER RIGHTLY YOU ON ONE OCCASION IN THE EARLY DAYS OF OUR
FRIENDSHIP DEFINED MY LIMITS IN A VERY PRECISE FASHION
YES I ANSWERED LAUGHING IT WAS A SINGULAR DOCUMENT PHILOSOPHY
ASTRONOMY AND POLITICS WERE MARKED AT ZERO I REMEMBER BOTANY
VARIABLE GEOLOGY PROFOUND AS REGARDS THE MUDSTAINS FROM ANY REGION
WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF TOWN CHEMISTRY ECCENTRIC ANATOMY
UNSYSTEMATIC SENSATIONAL LITERATURE AND CRIME RECORDS UNIQUE
VIOLINPLAYER BOXER SWORDSMAN LAWYER AND SELFPOISONER BY COCAINE
AND TOBACCO THOSE I THINK WERE THE MAIN POINTS OF MY ANALYSIS
HOLMES GRINNED AT THE LAST ITEM WELL HE SAID I SAY NOW AS I
SAID THEN THAT A MAN SHOULD KEEP HIS LITTLE BRAINATTIC STOCKED WITH
ALL THE FURNITURE THAT HE IS LIKELY TO USE AND THE REST HE CAN PUT
AWAY IN THE LUMBERROOM OF HIS LIBRARY WHERE HE CAN GET IT IF HE
WANTS IT NOW FOR SUCH A CASE AS THE ONE WHICH HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO
US TONIGHT WE NEED CERTAINLY TO MUSTER ALL OUR RESOURCES KINDLY
HAND ME DOWN THE LETTER K OF THE AMERICAN ENCYCLOPAEDIA WHICH
STANDS UPON THE SHELF BESIDE YOU THANK YOU NOW LET US CONSIDER THE
SITUATION AND SEE WHAT MAY BE DEDUCED FROM IT IN THE FIRST PLACE WE
MAY START WITH A STRONG PRESUMPTION THAT COLONEL OPENSHAW HAD SOME
VERY STRONG REASON FOR LEAVING AMERICA MEN AT HIS TIME OF LIFE DO
NOT CHANGE ALL THEIR HABITS AND EXCHANGE WILLINGLY THE CHARMING
CLIMATE OF FLORIDA FOR THE LONELY LIFE OF AN ENGLISH PROVINCIAL TOWN
HIS EXTREME LOVE OF SOLITUDE IN ENGLAND SUGGESTS THE IDEA THAT HE WAS
IN FEAR OF SOMEONE OR SOMETHING SO WE MAY ASSUME AS A WORKING
HYPOTHESIS THAT IT WAS FEAR OF SOMEONE OR SOMETHING WHICH DROVE HIM
FROM AMERICA AS TO WHAT IT WAS HE FEARED WE CAN ONLY DEDUCE THAT BY
CONSIDERING THE FORMIDABLE LETTERS WHICH WERE RECEIVED BY HIMSELF AND
HIS SUCCESSORS DID YOU REMARK THE POSTMARKS OF THOSE LETTERS
THE FIRST WAS FROM PONDICHERRY THE SECOND FROM DUNDEE AND THE
THIRD FROM LONDON
FROM EAST LONDON WHAT DO YOU DEDUCE FROM THAT
THEY ARE ALL SEAPORTS THAT THE WRITER WAS ON BOARD OF A SHIP
EXCELLENT WE HAVE ALREADY A CLUE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE
PROBABILITYTHE STRONG PROBABILITYIS THAT THE WRITER WAS ON BOARD
OF A SHIP AND NOW LET US CONSIDER ANOTHER POINT IN THE CASE OF
PONDICHERRY SEVEN WEEKS ELAPSED BETWEEN THE THREAT AND ITS
FULFILMENT IN DUNDEE IT WAS ONLY SOME THREE OR FOUR DAYS DOES THAT
SUGGEST ANYTHING
A GREATER DISTANCE TO TRAVEL
BUT THE LETTER HAD ALSO A GREATER DISTANCE TO COME
THEN I DO NOT SEE THE POINT
THERE IS AT LEAST A PRESUMPTION THAT THE VESSEL IN WHICH THE MAN OR
MEN ARE IS A SAILINGSHIP IT LOOKS AS IF THEY ALWAYS SEND THEIR
SINGULAR WARNING OR TOKEN BEFORE THEM WHEN STARTING UPON THEIR
MISSION YOU SEE HOW QUICKLY THE DEED FOLLOWED THE SIGN WHEN IT CAME
FROM DUNDEE IF THEY HAD COME FROM PONDICHERRY IN A STEAMER THEY
WOULD HAVE ARRIVED ALMOST AS SOON AS THEIR LETTER BUT AS A MATTER
OF FACT SEVEN WEEKS ELAPSED I THINK THAT THOSE SEVEN WEEKS
REPRESENTED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MAILBOAT WHICH BROUGHT THE
LETTER AND THE SAILING VESSEL WHICH BROUGHT THE WRITER
IT IS POSSIBLE
MORE THAN THAT IT IS PROBABLE AND NOW YOU SEE THE DEADLY URGENCY
OF THIS NEW CASE AND WHY I URGED YOUNG OPENSHAW TO CAUTION THE BLOW
HAS ALWAYS FALLEN AT THE END OF THE TIME WHICH IT WOULD TAKE THE
SENDERS TO TRAVEL THE DISTANCE BUT THIS ONE COMES FROM LONDON AND
THEREFORE WE CANNOT COUNT UPON DELAY
GOOD GOD I CRIED WHAT CAN IT MEAN THIS RELENTLESS PERSECUTION
THE PAPERS WHICH OPENSHAW CARRIED ARE OBVIOUSLY OF VITAL IMPORTANCE
TO THE PERSON OR PERSONS IN THE SAILINGSHIP I THINK THAT IT IS
QUITE CLEAR THAT THERE MUST BE MORE THAN ONE OF THEM A SINGLE MAN
COULD NOT HAVE CARRIED OUT TWO DEATHS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO DECEIVE A
CORONERS JURY THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL IN IT AND THEY MUST
HAVE BEEN MEN OF RESOURCE AND DETERMINATION THEIR PAPERS THEY MEAN
TO HAVE BE THE HOLDER OF THEM WHO IT MAY IN THIS WAY YOU SEE K K
K CEASES TO BE THE INITIALS OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND BECOMES THE BADGE
OF A SOCIETY
BUT OF WHAT SOCIETY
HAVE YOU NEVER SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES BENDING FORWARD AND SINKING
HIS VOICEHAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE KU KLUX KLAN
I NEVER HAVE
HOLMES TURNED OVER THE LEAVES OF THE BOOK UPON HIS KNEE HERE IT
IS SAID HE PRESENTLY
KU KLUX KLAN A NAME DERIVED FROM THE FANCIFUL RESEMBLANCE TO THE
SOUND PRODUCED BY COCKING A RIFLE THIS TERRIBLE SECRET SOCIETY WAS
FORMED BY SOME EXCONFEDERATE SOLDIERS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES AFTER
THE CIVIL WAR AND IT RAPIDLY FORMED LOCAL BRANCHES IN DIFFERENT
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY NOTABLY IN TENNESSEE LOUISIANA THE CAROLINAS
GEORGIA AND FLORIDA ITS POWER WAS USED FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES
PRINCIPALLY FOR THE TERRORISING OF THE NEGRO VOTERS AND THE MURDERING
AND DRIVING FROM THE COUNTRY OF THOSE WHO WERE OPPOSED TO ITS VIEWS
ITS OUTRAGES WERE USUALLY PRECEDED BY A WARNING SENT TO THE MARKED
MAN IN SOME FANTASTIC BUT GENERALLY RECOGNISED SHAPEA SPRIG OF
OAKLEAVES IN SOME PARTS MELON SEEDS OR ORANGE PIPS IN OTHERS ON
RECEIVING THIS THE VICTIM MIGHT EITHER OPENLY ABJURE HIS FORMER WAYS
OR MIGHT FLY FROM THE COUNTRY IF HE BRAVED THE MATTER OUT DEATH
WOULD UNFAILINGLY COME UPON HIM AND USUALLY IN SOME STRANGE AND
UNFORESEEN MANNER SO PERFECT WAS THE ORGANISATION OF THE SOCIETY
AND SO SYSTEMATIC ITS METHODS THAT THERE IS HARDLY A CASE UPON
RECORD WHERE ANY MAN SUCCEEDED IN BRAVING IT WITH IMPUNITY OR IN
WHICH ANY OF ITS OUTRAGES WERE TRACED HOME TO THE PERPETRATORS FOR
SOME YEARS THE ORGANISATION FLOURISHED IN SPITE OF THE EFFORTS OF THE
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND OF THE BETTER CLASSES OF THE COMMUNITY
IN THE SOUTH EVENTUALLY IN THE YEAR THE MOVEMENT RATHER
SUDDENLY COLLAPSED ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN SPORADIC OUTBREAKS OF
THE SAME SORT SINCE THAT DATE
YOU WILL OBSERVE SAID HOLMES LAYING DOWN THE VOLUME THAT THE
SUDDEN BREAKING UP OF THE SOCIETY WAS COINCIDENT WITH THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF OPENSHAW FROM AMERICA WITH THEIR PAPERS IT MAY WELL
HAVE BEEN CAUSE AND EFFECT IT IS NO WONDER THAT HE AND HIS FAMILY
HAVE SOME OF THE MORE IMPLACABLE SPIRITS UPON THEIR TRACK YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS REGISTER AND DIARY MAY IMPLICATE SOME OF THE
FIRST MEN IN THE SOUTH AND THAT THERE MAY BE MANY WHO WILL NOT SLEEP
EASY AT NIGHT UNTIL IT IS RECOVERED
THEN THE PAGE WE HAVE SEEN
IS SUCH AS WE MIGHT EXPECT IT RAN IF I REMEMBER RIGHT SENT THE
PIPS TO A B AND CTHAT IS SENT THE SOCIETYS WARNING TO THEM
THEN THERE ARE SUCCESSIVE ENTRIES THAT A AND B CLEARED OR LEFT THE
COUNTRY AND FINALLY THAT C WAS VISITED WITH I FEAR A SINISTER
RESULT FOR C WELL I THINK DOCTOR THAT WE MAY LET SOME LIGHT INTO
THIS DARK PLACE AND I BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY CHANCE YOUNG OPENSHAW
HAS IN THE MEANTIME IS TO DO WHAT I HAVE TOLD HIM THERE IS NOTHING
MORE TO BE SAID OR TO BE DONE TONIGHT SO HAND ME OVER MY VIOLIN AND
LET US TRY TO FORGET FOR HALF AN HOUR THE MISERABLE WEATHER AND THE
STILL MORE MISERABLE WAYS OF OUR FELLOWMEN
IT HAD CLEARED IN THE MORNING AND THE SUN WAS SHINING WITH A SUBDUED
BRIGHTNESS THROUGH THE DIM VEIL WHICH HANGS OVER THE GREAT CITY
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS ALREADY AT BREAKFAST WHEN I CAME DOWN
YOU WILL EXCUSE ME FOR NOT WAITING FOR YOU SAID HE I HAVE I
FORESEE A VERY BUSY DAY BEFORE ME IN LOOKING INTO THIS CASE OF YOUNG
OPENSHAWS
WHAT STEPS WILL YOU TAKE I ASKED
IT WILL VERY MUCH DEPEND UPON THE RESULTS OF MY FIRST INQUIRIES I
MAY HAVE TO GO DOWN TO HORSHAM AFTER ALL
YOU WILL NOT GO THERE FIRST
NO I SHALL COMMENCE WITH THE CITY JUST RING THE BELL AND THE MAID
WILL BRING UP YOUR COFFEE
AS I WAITED I LIFTED THE UNOPENED NEWSPAPER FROM THE TABLE AND
GLANCED MY EYE OVER IT IT RESTED UPON A HEADING WHICH SENT A CHILL
TO MY HEART
HOLMES I CRIED YOU ARE TOO LATE
AH SAID HE LAYING DOWN HIS CUP I FEARED AS MUCH HOW WAS IT
DONE HE SPOKE CALMLY BUT I COULD SEE THAT HE WAS DEEPLY MOVED
MY EYE CAUGHT THE NAME OF OPENSHAW AND THE HEADING TRAGEDY NEAR
WATERLOO BRIDGE HERE IS THE ACCOUNT
BETWEEN NINE AND TEN LAST NIGHT POLICECONSTABLE COOK OF THE H
DIVISION ON DUTY NEAR WATERLOO BRIDGE HEARD A CRY FOR HELP AND A
SPLASH IN THE WATER THE NIGHT HOWEVER WAS EXTREMELY DARK AND
STORMY SO THAT IN SPITE OF THE HELP OF SEVERAL PASSERSBY IT WAS
QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO EFFECT A RESCUE THE ALARM HOWEVER WAS GIVEN
AND BY THE AID OF THE WATERPOLICE THE BODY WAS EVENTUALLY
RECOVERED IT PROVED TO BE THAT OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHOSE NAME AS
IT APPEARS FROM AN ENVELOPE WHICH WAS FOUND IN HIS POCKET WAS JOHN
OPENSHAW AND WHOSE RESIDENCE IS NEAR HORSHAM IT IS CONJECTURED THAT
HE MAY HAVE BEEN HURRYING DOWN TO CATCH THE LAST TRAIN FROM WATERLOO
STATION AND THAT IN HIS HASTE AND THE EXTREME DARKNESS HE MISSED HIS
PATH AND WALKED OVER THE EDGE OF ONE OF THE SMALL LANDINGPLACES FOR
RIVER STEAMBOATS THE BODY EXHIBITED NO TRACES OF VIOLENCE AND THERE
CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE DECEASED HAD BEEN THE VICTIM OF AN
UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT WHICH SHOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF CALLING THE
ATTENTION OF THE AUTHORITIES TO THE CONDITION OF THE RIVERSIDE
LANDINGSTAGES
WE SAT IN SILENCE FOR SOME MINUTES HOLMES MORE DEPRESSED AND SHAKEN
THAN I HAD EVER SEEN HIM
THAT HURTS MY PRIDE WATSON HE SAID AT LAST IT IS A PETTY
FEELING NO DOUBT BUT IT HURTS MY PRIDE IT BECOMES A PERSONAL
MATTER WITH ME NOW AND IF GOD SENDS ME HEALTH I SHALL SET MY HAND
UPON THIS GANG THAT HE SHOULD COME TO ME FOR HELP AND THAT I SHOULD
SEND HIM AWAY TO HIS DEATH HE SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND PACED
ABOUT THE ROOM IN UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION WITH A FLUSH UPON HIS
SALLOW CHEEKS AND A NERVOUS CLASPING AND UNCLASPING OF HIS LONG THIN
HANDS
THEY MUST BE CUNNING DEVILS HE EXCLAIMED AT LAST HOW COULD THEY
HAVE DECOYED HIM DOWN THERE THE EMBANKMENT IS NOT ON THE DIRECT LINE
TO THE STATION THE BRIDGE NO DOUBT WAS TOO CROWDED EVEN ON SUCH A
NIGHT FOR THEIR PURPOSE WELL WATSON WE SHALL SEE WHO WILL WIN IN
THE LONG RUN I AM GOING OUT NOW
TO THE POLICE
NO I SHALL BE MY OWN POLICE WHEN I HAVE SPUN THE WEB THEY MAY TAKE
THE FLIES BUT NOT BEFORE
ALL DAY I WAS ENGAGED IN MY PROFESSIONAL WORK AND IT WAS LATE IN THE
EVENING BEFORE I RETURNED TO BAKER STREET SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD NOT
COME BACK YET IT WAS NEARLY TEN OCLOCK BEFORE HE ENTERED LOOKING
PALE AND WORN HE WALKED UP TO THE SIDEBOARD AND TEARING A PIECE
FROM THE LOAF HE DEVOURED IT VORACIOUSLY WASHING IT DOWN WITH A LONG
DRAUGHT OF WATER
YOU ARE HUNGRY I REMARKED
STARVING IT HAD ESCAPED MY MEMORY I HAVE HAD NOTHING SINCE
BREAKFAST
NOTHING
NOT A BITE I HAD NO TIME TO THINK OF IT
AND HOW HAVE YOU SUCCEEDED
WELL
YOU HAVE A CLUE
I HAVE THEM IN THE HOLLOW OF MY HAND YOUNG OPENSHAW SHALL NOT LONG
REMAIN UNAVENGED WHY WATSON LET US PUT THEIR OWN DEVILISH
TRADEMARK UPON THEM IT IS WELL THOUGHT OF
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE TOOK AN ORANGE FROM THE CUPBOARD AND TEARING IT TO PIECES HE
SQUEEZED OUT THE PIPS UPON THE TABLE OF THESE HE TOOK FIVE AND
THRUST THEM INTO AN ENVELOPE ON THE INSIDE OF THE FLAP HE WROTE S
H FOR J O THEN HE SEALED IT AND ADDRESSED IT TO CAPTAIN JAMES
CALHOUN BARQUE LONE STAR SAVANNAH GEORGIA
THAT WILL AWAIT HIM WHEN HE ENTERS PORT SAID HE CHUCKLING IT
MAY GIVE HIM A SLEEPLESS NIGHT HE WILL FIND IT AS SURE A PRECURSOR
OF HIS FATE AS OPENSHAW DID BEFORE HIM
AND WHO IS THIS CAPTAIN CALHOUN
THE LEADER OF THE GANG I SHALL HAVE THE OTHERS BUT HE FIRST
HOW DID YOU TRACE IT THEN
HE TOOK A LARGE SHEET OF PAPER FROM HIS POCKET ALL COVERED WITH
DATES AND NAMES
I HAVE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY SAID HE OVER LLOYDS REGISTERS AND
FILES OF THE OLD PAPERS FOLLOWING THE FUTURE CAREER OF EVERY VESSEL
WHICH TOUCHED AT PONDICHERRY IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY IN THERE
WERE THIRTYSIX SHIPS OF FAIR TONNAGE WHICH WERE REPORTED THERE
DURING THOSE MONTHS OF THESE ONE THE LONE STAR INSTANTLY
ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION SINCE ALTHOUGH IT WAS REPORTED AS HAVING
CLEARED FROM LONDON THE NAME IS THAT WHICH IS GIVEN TO ONE OF THE
STATES OF THE UNION
TEXAS I THINK
I WAS NOT AND AM NOT SURE WHICH BUT I KNEW THAT THE SHIP MUST HAVE
AN AMERICAN ORIGIN
WHAT THEN
I SEARCHED THE DUNDEE RECORDS AND WHEN I FOUND THAT THE BARQUE LONE
STAR WAS THERE IN JANUARY MY SUSPICION BECAME A CERTAINTY I
THEN INQUIRED AS TO THE VESSELS WHICH LAY AT PRESENT IN THE PORT OF
LONDON
YES
THE LONE STAR HAD ARRIVED HERE LAST WEEK I WENT DOWN TO THE ALBERT
DOCK AND FOUND THAT SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN DOWN THE RIVER BY THE EARLY
TIDE THIS MORNING HOMEWARD BOUND TO SAVANNAH I WIRED TO GRAVESEND
AND LEARNED THAT SHE HAD PASSED SOME TIME AGO AND AS THE WIND IS
EASTERLY I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE IS NOW PAST THE GOODWINS AND NOT
VERY FAR FROM THE ISLE OF WIGHT
WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN
OH I HAVE MY HAND UPON HIM HE AND THE TWO MATES ARE AS I LEARN
THE ONLY NATIVEBORN AMERICANS IN THE SHIP THE OTHERS ARE FINNS AND
GERMANS I KNOW ALSO THAT THEY WERE ALL THREE AWAY FROM THE SHIP
LAST NIGHT I HAD IT FROM THE STEVEDORE WHO HAS BEEN LOADING THEIR
CARGO BY THE TIME THAT THEIR SAILINGSHIP REACHES SAVANNAH THE
MAILBOAT WILL HAVE CARRIED THIS LETTER AND THE CABLE WILL HAVE
INFORMED THE POLICE OF SAVANNAH THAT THESE THREE GENTLEMEN ARE BADLY
WANTED HERE UPON A CHARGE OF MURDER
THERE IS EVER A FLAW HOWEVER IN THE BEST LAID OF HUMAN PLANS AND
THE MURDERERS OF JOHN OPENSHAW WERE NEVER TO RECEIVE THE ORANGE PIPS
WHICH WOULD SHOW THEM THAT ANOTHER AS CUNNING AND AS RESOLUTE AS
THEMSELVES WAS UPON THEIR TRACK VERY LONG AND VERY SEVERE WERE THE
EQUINOCTIAL GALES THAT YEAR WE WAITED LONG FOR NEWS OF THE LONE STAR
OF SAVANNAH BUT NONE EVER REACHED US WE DID AT LAST HEAR THAT
SOMEWHERE FAR OUT IN THE ATLANTIC A SHATTERED STERNPOST OF A BOAT
WAS SEEN SWINGING IN THE TROUGH OF A WAVE WITH THE LETTERS L S
CARVED UPON IT AND THAT IS ALL WHICH WE SHALL EVER KNOW OF THE FATE
OF THE LONE STAR
THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
ISA WHITNEY BROTHER OF THE LATE ELIAS WHITNEY DD PRINCIPAL OF
THE THEOLOGICAL COLLEGE OF ST GEORGES WAS MUCH ADDICTED TO OPIUM
THE HABIT GREW UPON HIM AS I UNDERSTAND FROM SOME FOOLISH FREAK
WHEN HE WAS AT COLLEGE FOR HAVING READ DE QUINCEYS DESCRIPTION OF
HIS DREAMS AND SENSATIONS HE HAD DRENCHED HIS TOBACCO WITH LAUDANUM
IN AN ATTEMPT TO PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECTS HE FOUND AS SO MANY MORE
HAVE DONE THAT THE PRACTICE IS EASIER TO ATTAIN THAN TO GET RID OF
AND FOR MANY YEARS HE CONTINUED TO BE A SLAVE TO THE DRUG AN OBJECT
OF MINGLED HORROR AND PITY TO HIS FRIENDS AND RELATIVES I CAN SEE
HIM NOW WITH YELLOW PASTY FACE DROOPING LIDS AND PINPOINT
PUPILS ALL HUDDLED IN A CHAIR THE WRECK AND RUIN OF A NOBLE MAN
ONE NIGHTIT WAS IN JUNE THERE CAME A RING TO MY BELL ABOUT
THE HOUR WHEN A MAN GIVES HIS FIRST YAWN AND GLANCES AT THE CLOCK I
SAT UP IN MY CHAIR AND MY WIFE LAID HER NEEDLEWORK DOWN IN HER LAP
AND MADE A LITTLE FACE OF DISAPPOINTMENT
A PATIENT SAID SHE YOULL HAVE TO GO OUT
I GROANED FOR I WAS NEWLY COME BACK FROM A WEARY DAY
WE HEARD THE DOOR OPEN A FEW HURRIED WORDS AND THEN QUICK STEPS
UPON THE LINOLEUM OUR OWN DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A LADY CLAD IN SOME
DARKCOLOURED STUFF WITH A BLACK VEIL ENTERED THE ROOM
YOU WILL EXCUSE MY CALLING SO LATE SHE BEGAN AND THEN SUDDENLY
LOSING HER SELFCONTROL SHE RAN FORWARD THREW HER ARMS ABOUT MY
WIFES NECK AND SOBBED UPON HER SHOULDER OH IM IN SUCH TROUBLE
SHE CRIED I DO SO WANT A LITTLE HELP
WHY SAID MY WIFE PULLING UP HER VEIL IT IS KATE WHITNEY HOW
YOU STARTLED ME KATE I HAD NOT AN IDEA WHO YOU WERE WHEN YOU CAME
IN
I DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO DO SO I CAME STRAIGHT TO YOU THAT WAS
ALWAYS THE WAY FOLK WHO WERE IN GRIEF CAME TO MY WIFE LIKE BIRDS TO
A LIGHTHOUSE
IT WAS VERY SWEET OF YOU TO COME NOW YOU MUST HAVE SOME WINE AND
WATER AND SIT HERE COMFORTABLY AND TELL US ALL ABOUT IT OR SHOULD
YOU RATHER THAT I SENT JAMES OFF TO BED
OH NO NO I WANT THE DOCTORS ADVICE AND HELP TOO ITS ABOUT
ISA HE HAS NOT BEEN HOME FOR TWO DAYS I AM SO FRIGHTENED ABOUT
HIM
IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TO US OF HER HUSBANDS
TROUBLE TO ME AS A DOCTOR TO MY WIFE AS AN OLD FRIEND AND SCHOOL
COMPANION WE SOOTHED AND COMFORTED HER BY SUCH WORDS AS WE COULD
FIND DID SHE KNOW WHERE HER HUSBAND WAS WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE
COULD BRING HIM BACK TO HER
IT SEEMS THAT IT WAS SHE HAD THE SUREST INFORMATION THAT OF LATE HE
HAD WHEN THE FIT WAS ON HIM MADE USE OF AN OPIUM DEN IN THE
FARTHEST EAST OF THE CITY HITHERTO HIS ORGIES HAD ALWAYS BEEN
CONFINED TO ONE DAY AND HE HAD COME BACK TWITCHING AND SHATTERED
IN THE EVENING BUT NOW THE SPELL HAD BEEN UPON HIM EIGHTANDFORTY
HOURS AND HE LAY THERE DOUBTLESS AMONG THE DREGS OF THE DOCKS
BREATHING IN THE POISON OR SLEEPING OFF THE EFFECTS THERE HE WAS TO
BE FOUND SHE WAS SURE OF IT AT THE BAR OF GOLD IN UPPER SWANDAM
LANE BUT WHAT WAS SHE TO DO HOW COULD SHE A YOUNG AND TIMID WOMAN
MAKE HER WAY INTO SUCH A PLACE AND PLUCK HER HUSBAND OUT FROM AMONG
THE RUFFIANS WHO SURROUNDED HIM
THERE WAS THE CASE AND OF COURSE THERE WAS BUT ONE WAY OUT OF IT
MIGHT I NOT ESCORT HER TO THIS PLACE AND THEN AS A SECOND THOUGHT
WHY SHOULD SHE COME AT ALL I WAS ISA WHITNEYS MEDICAL ADVISER AND
AS SUCH I HAD INFLUENCE OVER HIM I COULD MANAGE IT BETTER IF I WERE
ALONE I PROMISED HER ON MY WORD THAT I WOULD SEND HIM HOME IN A CAB
WITHIN TWO HOURS IF HE WERE INDEED AT THE ADDRESS WHICH SHE HAD GIVEN
ME AND SO IN TEN MINUTES I HAD LEFT MY ARMCHAIR AND CHEERY
SITTINGROOM BEHIND ME AND WAS SPEEDING EASTWARD IN A HANSOM ON A
STRANGE ERRAND AS IT SEEMED TO ME AT THE TIME THOUGH THE FUTURE
ONLY COULD SHOW HOW STRANGE IT WAS TO BE
BUT THERE WAS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN THE FIRST STAGE OF MY ADVENTURE
UPPER SWANDAM LANE IS A VILE ALLEY LURKING BEHIND THE HIGH WHARVES
WHICH LINE THE NORTH SIDE OF THE RIVER TO THE EAST OF LONDON BRIDGE
BETWEEN A SLOPSHOP AND A GINSHOP APPROACHED BY A STEEP FLIGHT OF
STEPS LEADING DOWN TO A BLACK GAP LIKE THE MOUTH OF A CAVE I FOUND
THE DEN OF WHICH I WAS IN SEARCH ORDERING MY CAB TO WAIT I PASSED
DOWN THE STEPS WORN HOLLOW IN THE CENTRE BY THE CEASELESS TREAD OF
DRUNKEN FEET AND BY THE LIGHT OF A FLICKERING OILLAMP ABOVE THE
DOOR I FOUND THE LATCH AND MADE MY WAY INTO A LONG LOW ROOM THICK
AND HEAVY WITH THE BROWN OPIUM SMOKE AND TERRACED WITH WOODEN
BERTHS LIKE THE FORECASTLE OF AN EMIGRANT SHIP
THROUGH THE GLOOM ONE COULD DIMLY CATCH A GLIMPSE OF BODIES LYING IN
STRANGE FANTASTIC POSES BOWED SHOULDERS BENT KNEES HEADS THROWN
BACK AND CHINS POINTING UPWARD WITH HERE AND THERE A DARK
LACKLUSTRE EYE TURNED UPON THE NEWCOMER OUT OF THE BLACK SHADOWS
THERE GLIMMERED LITTLE RED CIRCLES OF LIGHT NOW BRIGHT NOW FAINT
AS THE BURNING POISON WAXED OR WANED IN THE BOWLS OF THE METAL PIPES
THE MOST LAY SILENT BUT SOME MUTTERED TO THEMSELVES AND OTHERS
TALKED TOGETHER IN A STRANGE LOW MONOTONOUS VOICE THEIR
CONVERSATION COMING IN GUSHES AND THEN SUDDENLY TAILING OFF INTO
SILENCE EACH MUMBLING OUT HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND PAYING LITTLE HEED TO
THE WORDS OF HIS NEIGHBOUR AT THE FARTHER END WAS A SMALL BRAZIER OF
BURNING CHARCOAL BESIDE WHICH ON A THREELEGGED WOODEN STOOL THERE
SAT A TALL THIN OLD MAN WITH HIS JAW RESTING UPON HIS TWO FISTS
AND HIS ELBOWS UPON HIS KNEES STARING INTO THE FIRE
AS I ENTERED A SALLOW MALAY ATTENDANT HAD HURRIED UP WITH A PIPE FOR
ME AND A SUPPLY OF THE DRUG BECKONING ME TO AN EMPTY BERTH
THANK YOU I HAVE NOT COME TO STAY SAID I THERE IS A FRIEND OF
MINE HERE MR ISA WHITNEY AND I WISH TO SPEAK WITH HIM
THERE WAS A MOVEMENT AND AN EXCLAMATION FROM MY RIGHT AND PEERING
THROUGH THE GLOOM I SAW WHITNEY PALE HAGGARD AND UNKEMPT STARING
OUT AT ME
MY GOD ITS WATSON SAID HE HE WAS IN A PITIABLE STATE OF
REACTION WITH EVERY NERVE IN A TWITTER I SAY WATSON WHAT OCLOCK
IS IT
NEARLY ELEVEN
OF WHAT DAY
OF FRIDAY JUNE TH
GOOD HEAVENS I THOUGHT IT WAS WEDNESDAY IT IS WEDNESDAY WHAT
DYOU WANT TO FRIGHTEN A CHAP FOR HE SANK HIS FACE ONTO HIS ARMS
AND BEGAN TO SOB IN A HIGH TREBLE KEY
I TELL YOU THAT IT IS FRIDAY MAN YOUR WIFE HAS BEEN WAITING THIS
TWO DAYS FOR YOU YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF
SO I AM BUT YOUVE GOT MIXED WATSON FOR I HAVE ONLY BEEN HERE A
FEW HOURS THREE PIPES FOUR PIPESI FORGET HOW MANY BUT ILL GO
HOME WITH YOU I WOULDNT FRIGHTEN KATEPOOR LITTLE KATE GIVE ME
YOUR HAND HAVE YOU A CAB
YES I HAVE ONE WAITING
THEN I SHALL GO IN IT BUT I MUST OWE SOMETHING FIND WHAT I OWE
WATSON I AM ALL OFF COLOUR I CAN DO NOTHING FOR MYSELF
I WALKED DOWN THE NARROW PASSAGE BETWEEN THE DOUBLE ROW OF SLEEPERS
HOLDING MY BREATH TO KEEP OUT THE VILE STUPEFYING FUMES OF THE DRUG
AND LOOKING ABOUT FOR THE MANAGER AS I PASSED THE TALL MAN WHO SAT
BY THE BRAZIER I FELT A SUDDEN PLUCK AT MY SKIRT AND A LOW VOICE
WHISPERED WALK PAST ME AND THEN LOOK BACK AT ME THE WORDS FELL
QUITE DISTINCTLY UPON MY EAR I GLANCED DOWN THEY COULD ONLY HAVE
COME FROM THE OLD MAN AT MY SIDE AND YET HE SAT NOW AS ABSORBED AS
EVER VERY THIN VERY WRINKLED BENT WITH AGE AN OPIUM PIPE DANGLING
DOWN FROM BETWEEN HIS KNEES AS THOUGH IT HAD DROPPED IN SHEER
LASSITUDE FROM HIS FINGERS I TOOK TWO STEPS FORWARD AND LOOKED BACK
IT TOOK ALL MY SELFCONTROL TO PREVENT ME FROM BREAKING OUT INTO A
CRY OF ASTONISHMENT HE HAD TURNED HIS BACK SO THAT NONE COULD SEE
HIM BUT I HIS FORM HAD FILLED OUT HIS WRINKLES WERE GONE THE DULL
EYES HAD REGAINED THEIR FIRE AND THERE SITTING BY THE FIRE AND
GRINNING AT MY SURPRISE WAS NONE OTHER THAN SHERLOCK HOLMES HE MADE
A SLIGHT MOTION TO ME TO APPROACH HIM AND INSTANTLY AS HE TURNED
HIS FACE HALF ROUND TO THE COMPANY ONCE MORE SUBSIDED INTO A
DODDERING LOOSELIPPED SENILITY
HOLMES I WHISPERED WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING IN THIS DEN
AS LOW AS YOU CAN HE ANSWERED I HAVE EXCELLENT EARS IF YOU
WOULD HAVE THE GREAT KINDNESS TO GET RID OF THAT SOTTISH FRIEND OF
YOURS I SHOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY GLAD TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK WITH YOU
I HAVE A CAB OUTSIDE
THEN PRAY SEND HIM HOME IN IT YOU MAY SAFELY TRUST HIM FOR HE
APPEARS TO BE TOO LIMP TO GET INTO ANY MISCHIEF I SHOULD RECOMMEND
YOU ALSO TO SEND A NOTE BY THE CABMAN TO YOUR WIFE TO SAY THAT YOU
HAVE THROWN IN YOUR LOT WITH ME IF YOU WILL WAIT OUTSIDE I SHALL BE
WITH YOU IN FIVE MINUTES
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REFUSE ANY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES REQUESTS
FOR THEY WERE ALWAYS SO EXCEEDINGLY DEFINITE AND PUT FORWARD WITH
SUCH A QUIET AIR OF MASTERY I FELT HOWEVER THAT WHEN WHITNEY WAS
ONCE CONFINED IN THE CAB MY MISSION WAS PRACTICALLY ACCOMPLISHED AND
FOR THE REST I COULD NOT WISH ANYTHING BETTER THAN TO BE ASSOCIATED
WITH MY FRIEND IN ONE OF THOSE SINGULAR ADVENTURES WHICH WERE THE
NORMAL CONDITION OF HIS EXISTENCE IN A FEW MINUTES I HAD WRITTEN MY
NOTE PAID WHITNEYS BILL LED HIM OUT TO THE CAB AND SEEN HIM
DRIVEN THROUGH THE DARKNESS IN A VERY SHORT TIME A DECREPIT FIGURE
HAD EMERGED FROM THE OPIUM DEN AND I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET
WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR TWO STREETS HE SHUFFLED ALONG WITH A BENT
BACK AND AN UNCERTAIN FOOT THEN GLANCING QUICKLY ROUND HE
STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF OUT AND BURST INTO A HEARTY FIT OF LAUGHTER
I SUPPOSE WATSON SAID HE THAT YOU IMAGINE THAT I HAVE ADDED
OPIUMSMOKING TO COCAINE INJECTIONS AND ALL THE OTHER LITTLE
WEAKNESSES ON WHICH YOU HAVE FAVOURED ME WITH YOUR MEDICAL VIEWS
I WAS CERTAINLY SURPRISED TO FIND YOU THERE
BUT NOT MORE SO THAN I TO FIND YOU
I CAME TO FIND A FRIEND
AND I TO FIND AN ENEMY
AN ENEMY
YES ONE OF MY NATURAL ENEMIES OR SHALL I SAY MY NATURAL PREY
BRIEFLY WATSON I AM IN THE MIDST OF A VERY REMARKABLE INQUIRY AND
I HAVE HOPED TO FIND A CLUE IN THE INCOHERENT RAMBLINGS OF THESE
SOTS AS I HAVE DONE BEFORE NOW HAD I BEEN RECOGNISED IN THAT DEN MY
LIFE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WORTH AN HOURS PURCHASE FOR I HAVE USED IT
BEFORE NOW FOR MY OWN PURPOSES AND THE RASCALLY LASCAR WHO RUNS IT
HAS SWORN TO HAVE VENGEANCE UPON ME THERE IS A TRAPDOOR AT THE BACK
OF THAT BUILDING NEAR THE CORNER OF PAULS WHARF WHICH COULD TELL
SOME STRANGE TALES OF WHAT HAS PASSED THROUGH IT UPON THE MOONLESS
NIGHTS
WHAT YOU DO NOT MEAN BODIES
AY BODIES WATSON WE SHOULD BE RICH MEN IF WE HAD FOR EVERY
POOR DEVIL WHO HAS BEEN DONE TO DEATH IN THAT DEN IT IS THE VILEST
MURDERTRAP ON THE WHOLE RIVERSIDE AND I FEAR THAT NEVILLE ST CLAIR
HAS ENTERED IT NEVER TO LEAVE IT MORE BUT OUR TRAP SHOULD BE HERE
HE PUT HIS TWO FOREFINGERS BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND WHISTLED SHRILLYA
SIGNAL WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY A SIMILAR WHISTLE FROM THE DISTANCE
FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY THE RATTLE OF WHEELS AND THE CLINK OF HORSES
HOOFS
NOW WATSON SAID HOLMES AS A TALL DOGCART DASHED UP THROUGH THE
GLOOM THROWING OUT TWO GOLDEN TUNNELS OF YELLOW LIGHT FROM ITS SIDE
LANTERNS YOULL COME WITH ME WONT YOU
IF I CAN BE OF USE
OH A TRUSTY COMRADE IS ALWAYS OF USE AND A CHRONICLER STILL MORE
SO MY ROOM AT THE CEDARS IS A DOUBLEBEDDED ONE
THE CEDARS
YES THAT IS MR ST CLAIRS HOUSE I AM STAYING THERE WHILE I
CONDUCT THE INQUIRY
WHERE IS IT THEN
NEAR LEE IN KENT WE HAVE A SEVENMILE DRIVE BEFORE US
BUT I AM ALL IN THE DARK
OF COURSE YOU ARE YOULL KNOW ALL ABOUT IT PRESENTLY JUMP UP HERE
ALL RIGHT JOHN WE SHALL NOT NEED YOU HERES HALF A CROWN LOOK OUT
FOR ME TOMORROW ABOUT ELEVEN GIVE HER HER HEAD SO LONG THEN
HE FLICKED THE HORSE WITH HIS WHIP AND WE DASHED AWAY THROUGH THE
ENDLESS SUCCESSION OF SOMBRE AND DESERTED STREETS WHICH WIDENED
GRADUALLY UNTIL WE WERE FLYING ACROSS A BROAD BALUSTRADED BRIDGE
WITH THE MURKY RIVER FLOWING SLUGGISHLY BENEATH US BEYOND LAY
ANOTHER DULL WILDERNESS OF BRICKS AND MORTAR ITS SILENCE BROKEN ONLY
BY THE HEAVY REGULAR FOOTFALL OF THE POLICEMAN OR THE SONGS AND
SHOUTS OF SOME BELATED PARTY OF REVELLERS A DULL WRACK WAS DRIFTING
SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY AND A STAR OR TWO TWINKLED DIMLY HERE AND
THERE THROUGH THE RIFTS OF THE CLOUDS HOLMES DROVE IN SILENCE WITH
HIS HEAD SUNK UPON HIS BREAST AND THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IS LOST IN
THOUGHT WHILE I SAT BESIDE HIM CURIOUS TO LEARN WHAT THIS NEW QUEST
MIGHT BE WHICH SEEMED TO TAX HIS POWERS SO SORELY AND YET AFRAID TO
BREAK IN UPON THE CURRENT OF HIS THOUGHTS WE HAD DRIVEN SEVERAL
MILES AND WERE BEGINNING TO GET TO THE FRINGE OF THE BELT OF
SUBURBAN VILLAS WHEN HE SHOOK HIMSELF SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND
LIT UP HIS PIPE WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO HAS SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT
HE IS ACTING FOR THE BEST
YOU HAVE A GRAND GIFT OF SILENCE WATSON SAID HE IT MAKES YOU
QUITE INVALUABLE AS A COMPANION PON MY WORD IT IS A GREAT THING
FOR ME TO HAVE SOMEONE TO TALK TO FOR MY OWN THOUGHTS ARE NOT
OVERPLEASANT I WAS WONDERING WHAT I SHOULD SAY TO THIS DEAR LITTLE
WOMAN TONIGHT WHEN SHE MEETS ME AT THE DOOR
YOU FORGET THAT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
I SHALL JUST HAVE TIME TO TELL YOU THE FACTS OF THE CASE BEFORE WE
GET TO LEE IT SEEMS ABSURDLY SIMPLE AND YET SOMEHOW I CAN GET
NOTHING TO GO UPON THERES PLENTY OF THREAD NO DOUBT BUT I CANT
GET THE END OF IT INTO MY HAND NOW ILL STATE THE CASE CLEARLY AND
CONCISELY TO YOU WATSON AND MAYBE YOU CAN SEE A SPARK WHERE ALL IS
DARK TO ME
PROCEED THEN
SOME YEARS AGOTO BE DEFINITE IN MAY THERE CAME TO LEE A
GENTLEMAN NEVILLE ST CLAIR BY NAME WHO APPEARED TO HAVE PLENTY OF
MONEY HE TOOK A LARGE VILLA LAID OUT THE GROUNDS VERY NICELY AND
LIVED GENERALLY IN GOOD STYLE BY DEGREES HE MADE FRIENDS IN THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD AND IN HE MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A LOCAL BREWER
BY WHOM HE NOW HAS TWO CHILDREN HE HAD NO OCCUPATION BUT WAS
INTERESTED IN SEVERAL COMPANIES AND WENT INTO TOWN AS A RULE IN THE
MORNING RETURNING BY THE FROM CANNON STREET EVERY NIGHT MR
ST CLAIR IS NOW THIRTYSEVEN YEARS OF AGE IS A MAN OF TEMPERATE
HABITS A GOOD HUSBAND A VERY AFFECTIONATE FATHER AND A MAN WHO IS
POPULAR WITH ALL WHO KNOW HIM I MAY ADD THAT HIS WHOLE DEBTS AT THE
PRESENT MOMENT AS FAR AS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN AMOUNT TO
S WHILE HE HAS STANDING TO HIS CREDIT IN THE CAPITAL AND
COUNTIES BANK THERE IS NO REASON THEREFORE TO THINK THAT MONEY
TROUBLES HAVE BEEN WEIGHING UPON HIS MIND
LAST MONDAY MR NEVILLE ST CLAIR WENT INTO TOWN RATHER EARLIER THAN
USUAL REMARKING BEFORE HE STARTED THAT HE HAD TWO IMPORTANT
COMMISSIONS TO PERFORM AND THAT HE WOULD BRING HIS LITTLE BOY HOME A
BOX OF BRICKS NOW BY THE MEREST CHANCE HIS WIFE RECEIVED A
TELEGRAM UPON THIS SAME MONDAY VERY SHORTLY AFTER HIS DEPARTURE TO
THE EFFECT THAT A SMALL PARCEL OF CONSIDERABLE VALUE WHICH SHE HAD
BEEN EXPECTING WAS WAITING FOR HER AT THE OFFICES OF THE ABERDEEN
SHIPPING COMPANY NOW IF YOU ARE WELL UP IN YOUR LONDON YOU WILL
KNOW THAT THE OFFICE OF THE COMPANY IS IN FRESNO STREET WHICH
BRANCHES OUT OF UPPER SWANDAM LANE WHERE YOU FOUND ME TONIGHT MRS
ST CLAIR HAD HER LUNCH STARTED FOR THE CITY DID SOME SHOPPING
PROCEEDED TO THE COMPANYS OFFICE GOT HER PACKET AND FOUND HERSELF
AT EXACTLY WALKING THROUGH SWANDAM LANE ON HER WAY BACK TO THE
STATION HAVE YOU FOLLOWED ME SO FAR
IT IS VERY CLEAR
IF YOU REMEMBER MONDAY WAS AN EXCEEDINGLY HOT DAY AND MRS ST
CLAIR WALKED SLOWLY GLANCING ABOUT IN THE HOPE OF SEEING A CAB AS
SHE DID NOT LIKE THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IN WHICH SHE FOUND HERSELF WHILE
SHE WAS WALKING IN THIS WAY DOWN SWANDAM LANE SHE SUDDENLY HEARD AN
EJACULATION OR CRY AND WAS STRUCK COLD TO SEE HER HUSBAND LOOKING
DOWN AT HER AND AS IT SEEMED TO HER BECKONING TO HER FROM A
SECONDFLOOR WINDOW THE WINDOW WAS OPEN AND SHE DISTINCTLY SAW HIS
FACE WHICH SHE DESCRIBES AS BEING TERRIBLY AGITATED HE WAVED HIS
HANDS FRANTICALLY TO HER AND THEN VANISHED FROM THE WINDOW SO
SUDDENLY THAT IT SEEMED TO HER THAT HE HAD BEEN PLUCKED BACK BY SOME
IRRESISTIBLE FORCE FROM BEHIND ONE SINGULAR POINT WHICH STRUCK HER
QUICK FEMININE EYE WAS THAT ALTHOUGH HE WORE SOME DARK COAT SUCH AS
HE HAD STARTED TO TOWN IN HE HAD ON NEITHER COLLAR NOR NECKTIE
CONVINCED THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS WITH HIM SHE RUSHED DOWN THE
STEPSFOR THE HOUSE WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE OPIUM DEN IN WHICH YOU
FOUND ME TONIGHTAND RUNNING THROUGH THE FRONT ROOM SHE ATTEMPTED
TO ASCEND THE STAIRS WHICH LED TO THE FIRST FLOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE
STAIRS HOWEVER SHE MET THIS LASCAR SCOUNDREL OF WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN
WHO THRUST HER BACK AND AIDED BY A DANE WHO ACTS AS ASSISTANT
THERE PUSHED HER OUT INTO THE STREET FILLED WITH THE MOST MADDENING
DOUBTS AND FEARS SHE RUSHED DOWN THE LANE AND BY RARE GOODFORTUNE
MET IN FRESNO STREET A NUMBER OF CONSTABLES WITH AN INSPECTOR ALL ON
THEIR WAY TO THEIR BEAT THE INSPECTOR AND TWO MEN ACCOMPANIED HER
BACK AND IN SPITE OF THE CONTINUED RESISTANCE OF THE PROPRIETOR
THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE ROOM IN WHICH MR ST CLAIR HAD LAST BEEN
SEEN THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIM THERE IN FACT IN THE WHOLE OF THAT
FLOOR THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE FOUND SAVE A CRIPPLED WRETCH OF HIDEOUS
ASPECT WHO IT SEEMS MADE HIS HOME THERE BOTH HE AND THE LASCAR
STOUTLY SWORE THAT NO ONE ELSE HAD BEEN IN THE FRONT ROOM DURING THE
AFTERNOON SO DETERMINED WAS THEIR DENIAL THAT THE INSPECTOR WAS
STAGGERED AND HAD ALMOST COME TO BELIEVE THAT MRS ST CLAIR HAD
BEEN DELUDED WHEN WITH A CRY SHE SPRANG AT A SMALL DEAL BOX WHICH
LAY UPON THE TABLE AND TORE THE LID FROM IT OUT THERE FELL A CASCADE
OF CHILDRENS BRICKS IT WAS THE TOY WHICH HE HAD PROMISED TO BRING
HOME
THIS DISCOVERY AND THE EVIDENT CONFUSION WHICH THE CRIPPLE SHOWED
MADE THE INSPECTOR REALISE THAT THE MATTER WAS SERIOUS THE ROOMS
WERE CAREFULLY EXAMINED AND RESULTS ALL POINTED TO AN ABOMINABLE
CRIME THE FRONT ROOM WAS PLAINLY FURNISHED AS A SITTINGROOM AND LED
INTO A SMALL BEDROOM WHICH LOOKED OUT UPON THE BACK OF ONE OF THE
WHARVES BETWEEN THE WHARF AND THE BEDROOM WINDOW IS A NARROW STRIP
WHICH IS DRY AT LOW TIDE BUT IS COVERED AT HIGH TIDE WITH AT LEAST
FOUR AND A HALF FEET OF WATER THE BEDROOM WINDOW WAS A BROAD ONE AND
OPENED FROM BELOW ON EXAMINATION TRACES OF BLOOD WERE TO BE SEEN
UPON THE WINDOWSILL AND SEVERAL SCATTERED DROPS WERE VISIBLE UPON
THE WOODEN FLOOR OF THE BEDROOM THRUST AWAY BEHIND A CURTAIN IN THE
FRONT ROOM WERE ALL THE CLOTHES OF MR NEVILLE ST CLAIR WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF HIS COAT HIS BOOTS HIS SOCKS HIS HAT AND HIS
WATCHALL WERE THERE THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF VIOLENCE UPON ANY OF
THESE GARMENTS AND THERE WERE NO OTHER TRACES OF MR NEVILLE ST
CLAIR OUT OF THE WINDOW HE MUST APPARENTLY HAVE GONE FOR NO OTHER
EXIT COULD BE DISCOVERED AND THE OMINOUS BLOODSTAINS UPON THE SILL
GAVE LITTLE PROMISE THAT HE COULD SAVE HIMSELF BY SWIMMING FOR THE
TIDE WAS AT ITS VERY HIGHEST AT THE MOMENT OF THE TRAGEDY
AND NOW AS TO THE VILLAINS WHO SEEMED TO BE IMMEDIATELY IMPLICATED
IN THE MATTER THE LASCAR WAS KNOWN TO BE A MAN OF THE VILEST
ANTECEDENTS BUT AS BY MRS ST CLAIRS STORY HE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE
BEEN AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIR WITHIN A VERY FEW SECONDS OF HER
HUSBANDS APPEARANCE AT THE WINDOW HE COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN MORE
THAN AN ACCESSORY TO THE CRIME HIS DEFENCE WAS ONE OF ABSOLUTE
IGNORANCE AND HE PROTESTED THAT HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE DOINGS
OF HUGH BOONE HIS LODGER AND THAT HE COULD NOT ACCOUNT IN ANY WAY
FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE MISSING GENTLEMANS CLOTHES
SO MUCH FOR THE LASCAR MANAGER NOW FOR THE SINISTER CRIPPLE WHO
LIVES UPON THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE OPIUM DEN AND WHO WAS CERTAINLY
THE LAST HUMAN BEING WHOSE EYES RESTED UPON NEVILLE ST CLAIR HIS
NAME IS HUGH BOONE AND HIS HIDEOUS FACE IS ONE WHICH IS FAMILIAR TO
EVERY MAN WHO GOES MUCH TO THE CITY HE IS A PROFESSIONAL BEGGAR
THOUGH IN ORDER TO AVOID THE POLICE REGULATIONS HE PRETENDS TO A
SMALL TRADE IN WAX VESTAS SOME LITTLE DISTANCE DOWN THREADNEEDLE
STREET UPON THE LEFTHAND SIDE THERE IS AS YOU MAY HAVE REMARKED
A SMALL ANGLE IN THE WALL HERE IT IS THAT THIS CREATURE TAKES HIS
DAILY SEAT CROSSLEGGED WITH HIS TINY STOCK OF MATCHES ON HIS LAP
AND AS HE IS A PITEOUS SPECTACLE A SMALL RAIN OF CHARITY DESCENDS
INTO THE GREASY LEATHER CAP WHICH LIES UPON THE PAVEMENT BESIDE HIM
I HAVE WATCHED THE FELLOW MORE THAN ONCE BEFORE EVER I THOUGHT OF
MAKING HIS PROFESSIONAL ACQUAINTANCE AND I HAVE BEEN SURPRISED AT
THE HARVEST WHICH HE HAS REAPED IN A SHORT TIME HIS APPEARANCE YOU
SEE IS SO REMARKABLE THAT NO ONE CAN PASS HIM WITHOUT OBSERVING HIM
A SHOCK OF ORANGE HAIR A PALE FACE DISFIGURED BY A HORRIBLE SCAR
WHICH BY ITS CONTRACTION HAS TURNED UP THE OUTER EDGE OF HIS UPPER
LIP A BULLDOG CHIN AND A PAIR OF VERY PENETRATING DARK EYES WHICH
PRESENT A SINGULAR CONTRAST TO THE COLOUR OF HIS HAIR ALL MARK HIM
OUT FROM AMID THE COMMON CROWD OF MENDICANTS AND SO TOO DOES HIS
WIT FOR HE IS EVER READY WITH A REPLY TO ANY PIECE OF CHAFF WHICH
MAY BE THROWN AT HIM BY THE PASSERSBY THIS IS THE MAN WHOM WE NOW
LEARN TO HAVE BEEN THE LODGER AT THE OPIUM DEN AND TO HAVE BEEN THE
LAST MAN TO SEE THE GENTLEMAN OF WHOM WE ARE IN QUEST
BUT A CRIPPLE SAID I WHAT COULD HE HAVE DONE SINGLEHANDED
AGAINST A MAN IN THE PRIME OF LIFE
HE IS A CRIPPLE IN THE SENSE THAT HE WALKS WITH A LIMP BUT IN OTHER
RESPECTS HE APPEARS TO BE A POWERFUL AND WELLNURTURED MAN SURELY
YOUR MEDICAL EXPERIENCE WOULD TELL YOU WATSON THAT WEAKNESS IN ONE
LIMB IS OFTEN COMPENSATED FOR BY EXCEPTIONAL STRENGTH IN THE OTHERS
PRAY CONTINUE YOUR NARRATIVE
MRS ST CLAIR HAD FAINTED AT THE SIGHT OF THE BLOOD UPON THE
WINDOW AND SHE WAS ESCORTED HOME IN A CAB BY THE POLICE AS HER
PRESENCE COULD BE OF NO HELP TO THEM IN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS
INSPECTOR BARTON WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE CASE MADE A VERY CAREFUL
EXAMINATION OF THE PREMISES BUT WITHOUT FINDING ANYTHING WHICH THREW
ANY LIGHT UPON THE MATTER ONE MISTAKE HAD BEEN MADE IN NOT ARRESTING
BOONE INSTANTLY AS HE WAS ALLOWED SOME FEW MINUTES DURING WHICH HE
MIGHT HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH HIS FRIEND THE LASCAR BUT THIS FAULT
WAS SOON REMEDIED AND HE WAS SEIZED AND SEARCHED WITHOUT ANYTHING
BEING FOUND WHICH COULD INCRIMINATE HIM THERE WERE IT IS TRUE SOME
BLOODSTAINS UPON HIS RIGHT SHIRTSLEEVE BUT HE POINTED TO HIS
RINGFINGER WHICH HAD BEEN CUT NEAR THE NAIL AND EXPLAINED THAT THE
BLEEDING CAME FROM THERE ADDING THAT HE HAD BEEN TO THE WINDOW NOT
LONG BEFORE AND THAT THE STAINS WHICH HAD BEEN OBSERVED THERE CAME
DOUBTLESS FROM THE SAME SOURCE HE DENIED STRENUOUSLY HAVING EVER
SEEN MR NEVILLE ST CLAIR AND SWORE THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE CLOTHES
IN HIS ROOM WAS AS MUCH A MYSTERY TO HIM AS TO THE POLICE AS TO MRS
ST CLAIRS ASSERTION THAT SHE HAD ACTUALLY SEEN HER HUSBAND AT THE
WINDOW HE DECLARED THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN EITHER MAD OR DREAMING
HE WAS REMOVED LOUDLY PROTESTING TO THE POLICESTATION WHILE THE
INSPECTOR REMAINED UPON THE PREMISES IN THE HOPE THAT THE EBBING TIDE
MIGHT AFFORD SOME FRESH CLUE
AND IT DID THOUGH THEY HARDLY FOUND UPON THE MUDBANK WHAT THEY HAD
FEARED TO FIND IT WAS NEVILLE ST CLAIRS COAT AND NOT NEVILLE ST
CLAIR WHICH LAY UNCOVERED AS THE TIDE RECEDED AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY FOUND IN THE POCKETS
I CANNOT IMAGINE
NO I DONT THINK YOU WOULD GUESS EVERY POCKET STUFFED WITH PENNIES
AND HALFPENNIES PENNIES AND HALFPENNIES IT WAS NO WONDER
THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE TIDE BUT A HUMAN BODY IS A
DIFFERENT MATTER THERE IS A FIERCE EDDY BETWEEN THE WHARF AND THE
HOUSE IT SEEMED LIKELY ENOUGH THAT THE WEIGHTED COAT HAD REMAINED
WHEN THE STRIPPED BODY HAD BEEN SUCKED AWAY INTO THE RIVER
BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT ALL THE OTHER CLOTHES WERE FOUND IN THE ROOM
WOULD THE BODY BE DRESSED IN A COAT ALONE
NO SIR BUT THE FACTS MIGHT BE MET SPECIOUSLY ENOUGH SUPPOSE THAT
THIS MAN BOONE HAD THRUST NEVILLE ST CLAIR THROUGH THE WINDOW THERE
IS NO HUMAN EYE WHICH COULD HAVE SEEN THE DEED WHAT WOULD HE DO
THEN IT WOULD OF COURSE INSTANTLY STRIKE HIM THAT HE MUST GET RID OF
THE TELLTALE GARMENTS HE WOULD SEIZE THE COAT THEN AND BE IN THE
ACT OF THROWING IT OUT WHEN IT WOULD OCCUR TO HIM THAT IT WOULD SWIM
AND NOT SINK HE HAS LITTLE TIME FOR HE HAS HEARD THE SCUFFLE
DOWNSTAIRS WHEN THE WIFE TRIED TO FORCE HER WAY UP AND PERHAPS HE
HAS ALREADY HEARD FROM HIS LASCAR CONFEDERATE THAT THE POLICE ARE
HURRYING UP THE STREET THERE IS NOT AN INSTANT TO BE LOST HE RUSHES
TO SOME SECRET HOARD WHERE HE HAS ACCUMULATED THE FRUITS OF HIS
BEGGARY AND HE STUFFS ALL THE COINS UPON WHICH HE CAN LAY HIS HANDS
INTO THE POCKETS TO MAKE SURE OF THE COATS SINKING HE THROWS IT
OUT AND WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME WITH THE OTHER GARMENTS HAD NOT HE
HEARD THE RUSH OF STEPS BELOW AND ONLY JUST HAD TIME TO CLOSE THE
WINDOW WHEN THE POLICE APPEARED
IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS FEASIBLE
WELL WE WILL TAKE IT AS A WORKING HYPOTHESIS FOR WANT OF A BETTER
BOONE AS I HAVE TOLD YOU WAS ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO THE STATION BUT
IT COULD NOT BE SHOWN THAT THERE HAD EVER BEFORE BEEN ANYTHING
AGAINST HIM HE HAD FOR YEARS BEEN KNOWN AS A PROFESSIONAL BEGGAR
BUT HIS LIFE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN A VERY QUIET AND INNOCENT ONE
THERE THE MATTER STANDS AT PRESENT AND THE QUESTIONS WHICH HAVE TO
BE SOLVEDWHAT NEVILLE ST CLAIR WAS DOING IN THE OPIUM DEN WHAT
HAPPENED TO HIM WHEN THERE WHERE IS HE NOW AND WHAT HUGH BOONE HAD
TO DO WITH HIS DISAPPEARANCEARE ALL AS FAR FROM A SOLUTION AS EVER
I CONFESS THAT I CANNOT RECALL ANY CASE WITHIN MY EXPERIENCE WHICH
LOOKED AT THE FIRST GLANCE SO SIMPLE AND YET WHICH PRESENTED SUCH
DIFFICULTIES
WHILE SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD BEEN DETAILING THIS SINGULAR SERIES OF
EVENTS WE HAD BEEN WHIRLING THROUGH THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE GREAT TOWN
UNTIL THE LAST STRAGGLING HOUSES HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND WE RATTLED
ALONG WITH A COUNTRY HEDGE UPON EITHER SIDE OF US JUST AS HE
FINISHED HOWEVER WE DROVE THROUGH TWO SCATTERED VILLAGES WHERE A
FEW LIGHTS STILL GLIMMERED IN THE WINDOWS
WE ARE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF LEE SAID MY COMPANION WE HAVE TOUCHED
ON THREE ENGLISH COUNTIES IN OUR SHORT DRIVE STARTING IN MIDDLESEX
PASSING OVER AN ANGLE OF SURREY AND ENDING IN KENT SEE THAT LIGHT
AMONG THE TREES THAT IS THE CEDARS AND BESIDE THAT LAMP SITS A
WOMAN WHOSE ANXIOUS EARS HAVE ALREADY I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT CAUGHT
THE CLINK OF OUR HORSES FEET
BUT WHY ARE YOU NOT CONDUCTING THE CASE FROM BAKER STREET I ASKED
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY INQUIRIES WHICH MUST BE MADE OUT HERE MRS
ST CLAIR HAS MOST KINDLY PUT TWO ROOMS AT MY DISPOSAL AND YOU MAY
REST ASSURED THAT SHE WILL HAVE NOTHING BUT A WELCOME FOR MY FRIEND
AND COLLEAGUE I HATE TO MEET HER WATSON WHEN I HAVE NO NEWS OF HER
HUSBAND HERE WE ARE WHOA THERE WHOA
WE HAD PULLED UP IN FRONT OF A LARGE VILLA WHICH STOOD WITHIN ITS OWN
GROUNDS A STABLEBOY HAD RUN OUT TO THE HORSES HEAD AND SPRINGING
DOWN I FOLLOWED HOLMES UP THE SMALL WINDING GRAVELDRIVE WHICH LED
TO THE HOUSE AS WE APPROACHED THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A LITTLE
BLONDE WOMAN STOOD IN THE OPENING CLAD IN SOME SORT OF LIGHT
MOUSSELINE DE SOIE WITH A TOUCH OF FLUFFY PINK CHIFFON AT HER NECK
AND WRISTS SHE STOOD WITH HER FIGURE OUTLINED AGAINST THE FLOOD OF
LIGHT ONE HAND UPON THE DOOR ONE HALFRAISED IN HER EAGERNESS HER
BODY SLIGHTLY BENT HER HEAD AND FACE PROTRUDED WITH EAGER EYES AND
PARTED LIPS A STANDING QUESTION
WELL SHE CRIED WELL AND THEN SEEING THAT THERE WERE TWO OF
US SHE GAVE A CRY OF HOPE WHICH SANK INTO A GROAN AS SHE SAW THAT MY
COMPANION SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
NO GOOD NEWS
NONE
NO BAD
NO
THANK GOD FOR THAT BUT COME IN YOU MUST BE WEARY FOR YOU HAVE HAD
A LONG DAY
THIS IS MY FRIEND DR WATSON HE HAS BEEN OF MOST VITAL USE TO ME
IN SEVERAL OF MY CASES AND A LUCKY CHANCE HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR
ME TO BRING HIM OUT AND ASSOCIATE HIM WITH THIS INVESTIGATION
I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU SAID SHE PRESSING MY HAND WARMLY YOU
WILL I AM SURE FORGIVE ANYTHING THAT MAY BE WANTING IN OUR
ARRANGEMENTS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE BLOW WHICH HAS COME SO SUDDENLY
UPON US
MY DEAR MADAM SAID I I AM AN OLD CAMPAIGNER AND IF I WERE NOT I
CAN VERY WELL SEE THAT NO APOLOGY IS NEEDED IF I CAN BE OF ANY
ASSISTANCE EITHER TO YOU OR TO MY FRIEND HERE I SHALL BE INDEED
HAPPY
NOW MR SHERLOCK HOLMES SAID THE LADY AS WE ENTERED A WELLLIT
DININGROOM UPON THE TABLE OF WHICH A COLD SUPPER HAD BEEN LAID OUT
I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO ASK YOU ONE OR TWO PLAIN QUESTIONS TO
WHICH I BEG THAT YOU WILL GIVE A PLAIN ANSWER
CERTAINLY MADAM
DO NOT TROUBLE ABOUT MY FEELINGS I AM NOT HYSTERICAL NOR GIVEN TO
FAINTING I SIMPLY WISH TO HEAR YOUR REAL REAL OPINION
UPON WHAT POINT
IN YOUR HEART OF HEARTS DO YOU THINK THAT NEVILLE IS ALIVE
SHERLOCK HOLMES SEEMED TO BE EMBARRASSED BY THE QUESTION FRANKLY
NOW SHE REPEATED STANDING UPON THE RUG AND LOOKING KEENLY DOWN AT
HIM AS HE LEANED BACK IN A BASKETCHAIR
FRANKLY THEN MADAM I DO NOT
YOU THINK THAT HE IS DEAD
I DO
MURDERED
I DONT SAY THAT PERHAPS
AND ON WHAT DAY DID HE MEET HIS DEATH
ON MONDAY
THEN PERHAPS MR HOLMES YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN HOW IT
IS THAT I HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIM TODAY
SHERLOCK HOLMES SPRANG OUT OF HIS CHAIR AS IF HE HAD BEEN GALVANISED
WHAT HE ROARED
YES TODAY SHE STOOD SMILING HOLDING UP A LITTLE SLIP OF PAPER
IN THE AIR
MAY I SEE IT
CERTAINLY
HE SNATCHED IT FROM HER IN HIS EAGERNESS AND SMOOTHING IT OUT UPON
THE TABLE HE DREW OVER THE LAMP AND EXAMINED IT INTENTLY I HAD LEFT
MY CHAIR AND WAS GAZING AT IT OVER HIS SHOULDER THE ENVELOPE WAS A
VERY COARSE ONE AND WAS STAMPED WITH THE GRAVESEND POSTMARK AND WITH
THE DATE OF THAT VERY DAY OR RATHER OF THE DAY BEFORE FOR IT WAS
CONSIDERABLY AFTER MIDNIGHT
COARSE WRITING MURMURED HOLMES SURELY THIS IS NOT YOUR HUSBANDS
WRITING MADAM
NO BUT THE ENCLOSURE IS
I PERCEIVE ALSO THAT WHOEVER ADDRESSED THE ENVELOPE HAD TO GO AND
INQUIRE AS TO THE ADDRESS
HOW CAN YOU TELL THAT
THE NAME YOU SEE IS IN PERFECTLY BLACK INK WHICH HAS DRIED
ITSELF THE REST IS OF THE GREYISH COLOUR WHICH SHOWS THAT
BLOTTINGPAPER HAS BEEN USED IF IT HAD BEEN WRITTEN STRAIGHT OFF
AND THEN BLOTTED NONE WOULD BE OF A DEEP BLACK SHADE THIS MAN HAS
WRITTEN THE NAME AND THERE HAS THEN BEEN A PAUSE BEFORE HE WROTE THE
ADDRESS WHICH CAN ONLY MEAN THAT HE WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT IT IS
OF COURSE A TRIFLE BUT THERE IS NOTHING SO IMPORTANT AS TRIFLES
LET US NOW SEE THE LETTER HA THERE HAS BEEN AN ENCLOSURE HERE
YES THERE WAS A RING HIS SIGNETRING
AND YOU ARE SURE THAT THIS IS YOUR HUSBANDS HAND
ONE OF HIS HANDS
ONE
HIS HAND WHEN HE WROTE HURRIEDLY IT IS VERY UNLIKE HIS USUAL
WRITING AND YET I KNOW IT WELL
DEAREST DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED ALL WILL COME WELL THERE IS A HUGE
ERROR WHICH IT MAY TAKE SOME LITTLE TIME TO RECTIFY WAIT IN
PATIENCE
NEVILLE
WRITTEN IN PENCIL UPON THE FLYLEAF OF A BOOK OCTAVO SIZE NO
WATERMARK HUM POSTED TODAY IN GRAVESEND BY A MAN WITH A DIRTY
THUMB HA AND THE FLAP HAS BEEN GUMMED IF I AM NOT VERY MUCH IN
ERROR BY A PERSON WHO HAD BEEN CHEWING TOBACCO AND YOU HAVE NO
DOUBT THAT IT IS YOUR HUSBANDS HAND MADAM
NONE NEVILLE WROTE THOSE WORDS
AND THEY WERE POSTED TODAY AT GRAVESEND WELL MRS ST CLAIR THE
CLOUDS LIGHTEN THOUGH I SHOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY THAT THE DANGER IS
OVER
BUT HE MUST BE ALIVE MR HOLMES
UNLESS THIS IS A CLEVER FORGERY TO PUT US ON THE WRONG SCENT THE
RING AFTER ALL PROVES NOTHING IT MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM
NO NO IT IS IT IS HIS VERY OWN WRITING
VERY WELL IT MAY HOWEVER HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ON MONDAY AND ONLY
POSTED TODAY
THAT IS POSSIBLE
IF SO MUCH MAY HAVE HAPPENED BETWEEN
OH YOU MUST NOT DISCOURAGE ME MR HOLMES I KNOW THAT ALL IS WELL
WITH HIM THERE IS SO KEEN A SYMPATHY BETWEEN US THAT I SHOULD KNOW
IF EVIL CAME UPON HIM ON THE VERY DAY THAT I SAW HIM LAST HE CUT
HIMSELF IN THE BEDROOM AND YET I IN THE DININGROOM RUSHED UPSTAIRS
INSTANTLY WITH THE UTMOST CERTAINTY THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED DO
YOU THINK THAT I WOULD RESPOND TO SUCH A TRIFLE AND YET BE IGNORANT
OF HIS DEATH
I HAVE SEEN TOO MUCH NOT TO KNOW THAT THE IMPRESSION OF A WOMAN MAY
BE MORE VALUABLE THAN THE CONCLUSION OF AN ANALYTICAL REASONER AND
IN THIS LETTER YOU CERTAINLY HAVE A VERY STRONG PIECE OF EVIDENCE TO
CORROBORATE YOUR VIEW BUT IF YOUR HUSBAND IS ALIVE AND ABLE TO WRITE
LETTERS WHY SHOULD HE REMAIN AWAY FROM YOU
I CANNOT IMAGINE IT IS UNTHINKABLE
AND ON MONDAY HE MADE NO REMARKS BEFORE LEAVING YOU
NO
AND YOU WERE SURPRISED TO SEE HIM IN SWANDAM LANE
VERY MUCH SO
WAS THE WINDOW OPEN
YES
THEN HE MIGHT HAVE CALLED TO YOU
HE MIGHT
HE ONLY AS I UNDERSTAND GAVE AN INARTICULATE CRY
YES
A CALL FOR HELP YOU THOUGHT
YES HE WAVED HIS HANDS
BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CRY OF SURPRISE ASTONISHMENT AT THE
UNEXPECTED SIGHT OF YOU MIGHT CAUSE HIM TO THROW UP HIS HANDS
IT IS POSSIBLE
AND YOU THOUGHT HE WAS PULLED BACK
HE DISAPPEARED SO SUDDENLY
HE MIGHT HAVE LEAPED BACK YOU DID NOT SEE ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM
NO BUT THIS HORRIBLE MAN CONFESSED TO HAVING BEEN THERE AND THE
LASCAR WAS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
QUITE SO YOUR HUSBAND AS FAR AS YOU COULD SEE HAD HIS ORDINARY
CLOTHES ON
BUT WITHOUT HIS COLLAR OR TIE I DISTINCTLY SAW HIS BARE THROAT
HAD HE EVER SPOKEN OF SWANDAM LANE
NEVER
HAD HE EVER SHOWED ANY SIGNS OF HAVING TAKEN OPIUM
NEVER
THANK YOU MRS ST CLAIR THOSE ARE THE PRINCIPAL POINTS ABOUT
WHICH I WISHED TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR WE SHALL NOW HAVE A LITTLE
SUPPER AND THEN RETIRE FOR WE MAY HAVE A VERY BUSY DAY TOMORROW
A LARGE AND COMFORTABLE DOUBLEBEDDED ROOM HAD BEEN PLACED AT OUR
DISPOSAL AND I WAS QUICKLY BETWEEN THE SHEETS FOR I WAS WEARY AFTER
MY NIGHT OF ADVENTURE SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS A MAN HOWEVER WHO WHEN
HE HAD AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM UPON HIS MIND WOULD GO FOR DAYS AND EVEN
FOR A WEEK WITHOUT REST TURNING IT OVER REARRANGING HIS FACTS
LOOKING AT IT FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW UNTIL HE HAD EITHER FATHOMED
IT OR CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HIS DATA WERE INSUFFICIENT IT WAS SOON
EVIDENT TO ME THAT HE WAS NOW PREPARING FOR AN ALLNIGHT SITTING HE
TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND WAISTCOAT PUT ON A LARGE BLUE DRESSINGGOWN
AND THEN WANDERED ABOUT THE ROOM COLLECTING PILLOWS FROM HIS BED AND
CUSHIONS FROM THE SOFA AND ARMCHAIRS WITH THESE HE CONSTRUCTED A
SORT OF EASTERN DIVAN UPON WHICH HE PERCHED HIMSELF CROSSLEGGED
WITH AN OUNCE OF SHAG TOBACCO AND A BOX OF MATCHES LAID OUT IN FRONT
OF HIM IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THE LAMP I SAW HIM SITTING THERE AN OLD
BRIAR PIPE BETWEEN HIS LIPS HIS EYES FIXED VACANTLY UPON THE CORNER
OF THE CEILING THE BLUE SMOKE CURLING UP FROM HIM SILENT
MOTIONLESS WITH THE LIGHT SHINING UPON HIS STRONGSET AQUILINE
FEATURES SO HE SAT AS I DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP AND SO HE SAT WHEN A
SUDDEN EJACULATION CAUSED ME TO WAKE UP AND I FOUND THE SUMMER SUN
SHINING INTO THE APARTMENT THE PIPE WAS STILL BETWEEN HIS LIPS THE
SMOKE STILL CURLED UPWARD AND THE ROOM WAS FULL OF A DENSE TOBACCO
HAZE BUT NOTHING REMAINED OF THE HEAP OF SHAG WHICH I HAD SEEN UPON
THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
AWAKE WATSON HE ASKED
YES
GAME FOR A MORNING DRIVE
CERTAINLY
THEN DRESS NO ONE IS STIRRING YET BUT I KNOW WHERE THE STABLEBOY
SLEEPS AND WE SHALL SOON HAVE THE TRAP OUT HE CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF
AS HE SPOKE HIS EYES TWINKLED AND HE SEEMED A DIFFERENT MAN TO THE
SOMBRE THINKER OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
AS I DRESSED I GLANCED AT MY WATCH IT WAS NO WONDER THAT NO ONE WAS
STIRRING IT WAS TWENTYFIVE MINUTES PAST FOUR I HAD HARDLY FINISHED
WHEN HOLMES RETURNED WITH THE NEWS THAT THE BOY WAS PUTTING IN THE
HORSE
I WANT TO TEST A LITTLE THEORY OF MINE SAID HE PULLING ON HIS
BOOTS I THINK WATSON THAT YOU ARE NOW STANDING IN THE PRESENCE OF
ONE OF THE MOST ABSOLUTE FOOLS IN EUROPE I DESERVE TO BE KICKED FROM
HERE TO CHARING CROSS BUT I THINK I HAVE THE KEY OF THE AFFAIR NOW
AND WHERE IS IT I ASKED SMILING
IN THE BATHROOM HE ANSWERED OH YES I AM NOT JOKING HE
CONTINUED SEEING MY LOOK OF INCREDULITY I HAVE JUST BEEN THERE
AND I HAVE TAKEN IT OUT AND I HAVE GOT IT IN THIS GLADSTONE BAG
COME ON MY BOY AND WE SHALL SEE WHETHER IT WILL NOT FIT THE LOCK
WE MADE OUR WAY DOWNSTAIRS AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE AND OUT INTO THE
BRIGHT MORNING SUNSHINE IN THE ROAD STOOD OUR HORSE AND TRAP WITH
THE HALFCLAD STABLEBOY WAITING AT THE HEAD WE BOTH SPRANG IN AND
AWAY WE DASHED DOWN THE LONDON ROAD A FEW COUNTRY CARTS WERE
STIRRING BEARING IN VEGETABLES TO THE METROPOLIS BUT THE LINES OF
VILLAS ON EITHER SIDE WERE AS SILENT AND LIFELESS AS SOME CITY IN A
DREAM
IT HAS BEEN IN SOME POINTS A SINGULAR CASE SAID HOLMES FLICKING
THE HORSE ON INTO A GALLOP I CONFESS THAT I HAVE BEEN AS BLIND AS A
MOLE BUT IT IS BETTER TO LEARN WISDOM LATE THAN NEVER TO LEARN IT AT
ALL
IN TOWN THE EARLIEST RISERS WERE JUST BEGINNING TO LOOK SLEEPILY FROM
THEIR WINDOWS AS WE DROVE THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE SURREY SIDE
PASSING DOWN THE WATERLOO BRIDGE ROAD WE CROSSED OVER THE RIVER AND
DASHING UP WELLINGTON STREET WHEELED SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT AND FOUND
OURSELVES IN BOW STREET SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS WELL KNOWN TO THE FORCE
AND THE TWO CONSTABLES AT THE DOOR SALUTED HIM ONE OF THEM HELD THE
HORSES HEAD WHILE THE OTHER LED US IN
WHO IS ON DUTY ASKED HOLMES
INSPECTOR BRADSTREET SIR
AH BRADSTREET HOW ARE YOU A TALL STOUT OFFICIAL HAD COME DOWN
THE STONEFLAGGED PASSAGE IN A PEAKED CAP AND FROGGED JACKET I
WISH TO HAVE A QUIET WORD WITH YOU BRADSTREET CERTAINLY MR
HOLMES STEP INTO MY ROOM HERE IT WAS A SMALL OFFICELIKE ROOM
WITH A HUGE LEDGER UPON THE TABLE AND A TELEPHONE PROJECTING FROM
THE WALL THE INSPECTOR SAT DOWN AT HIS DESK
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU MR HOLMES
I CALLED ABOUT THAT BEGGARMAN BOONETHE ONE WHO WAS CHARGED WITH
BEING CONCERNED IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MR NEVILLE ST CLAIR OF
LEE
YES HE WAS BROUGHT UP AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER INQUIRIES
SO I HEARD YOU HAVE HIM HERE
IN THE CELLS
IS HE QUIET
OH HE GIVES NO TROUBLE BUT HE IS A DIRTY SCOUNDREL
DIRTY
YES IT IS ALL WE CAN DO TO MAKE HIM WASH HIS HANDS AND HIS FACE IS
AS BLACK AS A TINKERS WELL WHEN ONCE HIS CASE HAS BEEN SETTLED HE
WILL HAVE A REGULAR PRISON BATH AND I THINK IF YOU SAW HIM YOU
WOULD AGREE WITH ME THAT HE NEEDED IT
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM VERY MUCH
WOULD YOU THAT IS EASILY DONE COME THIS WAY YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR
BAG
NO I THINK THAT ILL TAKE IT
VERY GOOD COME THIS WAY IF YOU PLEASE HE LED US DOWN A PASSAGE
OPENED A BARRED DOOR PASSED DOWN A WINDING STAIR AND BROUGHT US TO
A WHITEWASHED CORRIDOR WITH A LINE OF DOORS ON EACH SIDE
THE THIRD ON THE RIGHT IS HIS SAID THE INSPECTOR HERE IT IS HE
QUIETLY SHOT BACK A PANEL IN THE UPPER PART OF THE DOOR AND GLANCED
THROUGH
HE IS ASLEEP SAID HE YOU CAN SEE HIM VERY WELL
WE BOTH PUT OUR EYES TO THE GRATING THE PRISONER LAY WITH HIS FACE
TOWARDS US IN A VERY DEEP SLEEP BREATHING SLOWLY AND HEAVILY HE
WAS A MIDDLESIZED MAN COARSELY CLAD AS BECAME HIS CALLING WITH A
COLOURED SHIRT PROTRUDING THROUGH THE RENT IN HIS TATTERED COAT HE
WAS AS THE INSPECTOR HAD SAID EXTREMELY DIRTY BUT THE GRIME WHICH
COVERED HIS FACE COULD NOT CONCEAL ITS REPULSIVE UGLINESS A BROAD
WHEAL FROM AN OLD SCAR RAN RIGHT ACROSS IT FROM EYE TO CHIN AND BY
ITS CONTRACTION HAD TURNED UP ONE SIDE OF THE UPPER LIP SO THAT
THREE TEETH WERE EXPOSED IN A PERPETUAL SNARL A SHOCK OF VERY BRIGHT
RED HAIR GREW LOW OVER HIS EYES AND FOREHEAD
HES A BEAUTY ISNT HE SAID THE INSPECTOR
HE CERTAINLY NEEDS A WASH REMARKED HOLMES I HAD AN IDEA THAT HE
MIGHT AND I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF BRINGING THE TOOLS WITH ME HE
OPENED THE GLADSTONE BAG AS HE SPOKE AND TOOK OUT TO MY
ASTONISHMENT A VERY LARGE BATHSPONGE
HE HE YOU ARE A FUNNY ONE CHUCKLED THE INSPECTOR
NOW IF YOU WILL HAVE THE GREAT GOODNESS TO OPEN THAT DOOR VERY
QUIETLY WE WILL SOON MAKE HIM CUT A MUCH MORE RESPECTABLE FIGURE
WELL I DONT KNOW WHY NOT SAID THE INSPECTOR HE DOESNT LOOK A
CREDIT TO THE BOW STREET CELLS DOES HE HE SLIPPED HIS KEY INTO THE
LOCK AND WE ALL VERY QUIETLY ENTERED THE CELL THE SLEEPER HALF
TURNED AND THEN SETTLED DOWN ONCE MORE INTO A DEEP SLUMBER HOLMES
STOOPED TO THE WATERJUG MOISTENED HIS SPONGE AND THEN RUBBED IT
TWICE VIGOROUSLY ACROSS AND DOWN THE PRISONERS FACE
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU HE SHOUTED TO MR NEVILLE ST CLAIR OF
LEE IN THE COUNTY OF KENT
NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I SEEN SUCH A SIGHT THE MANS FACE PEELED OFF
UNDER THE SPONGE LIKE THE BARK FROM A TREE GONE WAS THE COARSE BROWN
TINT GONE TOO WAS THE HORRID SCAR WHICH HAD SEAMED IT ACROSS AND
THE TWISTED LIP WHICH HAD GIVEN THE REPULSIVE SNEER TO THE FACE A
TWITCH BROUGHT AWAY THE TANGLED RED HAIR AND THERE SITTING UP IN
HIS BED WAS A PALE SADFACED REFINEDLOOKING MAN BLACKHAIRED AND
SMOOTHSKINNED RUBBING HIS EYES AND STARING ABOUT HIM WITH SLEEPY
BEWILDERMENT THEN SUDDENLY REALISING THE EXPOSURE HE BROKE INTO A
SCREAM AND THREW HIMSELF DOWN WITH HIS FACE TO THE PILLOW
GREAT HEAVENS CRIED THE INSPECTOR IT IS INDEED THE MISSING
MAN I KNOW HIM FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH
THE PRISONER TURNED WITH THE RECKLESS AIR OF A MAN WHO ABANDONS
HIMSELF TO HIS DESTINY BE IT SO SAID HE AND PRAY WHAT AM I
CHARGED WITH
WITH MAKING AWAY WITH MR NEVILLE STOH COME YOU CANT BE
CHARGED WITH THAT UNLESS THEY MAKE A CASE OF ATTEMPTED SUICIDE OF
IT SAID THE INSPECTOR WITH A GRIN WELL I HAVE BEEN TWENTYSEVEN
YEARS IN THE FORCE BUT THIS REALLY TAKES THE CAKE
IF I AM MR NEVILLE ST CLAIR THEN IT IS OBVIOUS THAT NO CRIME HAS
BEEN COMMITTED AND THAT THEREFORE I AM ILLEGALLY DETAINED
NO CRIME BUT A VERY GREAT ERROR HAS BEEN COMMITTED SAID HOLMES
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO HAVE TRUSTED YOUR WIFE
IT WAS NOT THE WIFE IT WAS THE CHILDREN GROANED THE PRISONER
GOD HELP ME I WOULD NOT HAVE THEM ASHAMED OF THEIR FATHER MY GOD
WHAT AN EXPOSURE WHAT CAN I DO
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM ON THE COUCH AND PATTED HIM
KINDLY ON THE SHOULDER
IF YOU LEAVE IT TO A COURT OF LAW TO CLEAR THE MATTER UP SAID HE
OF COURSE YOU CAN HARDLY AVOID PUBLICITY ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU
CONVINCE THE POLICE AUTHORITIES THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBLE CASE
AGAINST YOU I DO NOT KNOW THAT THERE IS ANY REASON THAT THE DETAILS
SHOULD FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE PAPERS INSPECTOR BRADSTREET WOULD I
AM SURE MAKE NOTES UPON ANYTHING WHICH YOU MIGHT TELL US AND SUBMIT
IT TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES THE CASE WOULD THEN NEVER GO INTO COURT
AT ALL
GOD BLESS YOU CRIED THE PRISONER PASSIONATELY I WOULD HAVE
ENDURED IMPRISONMENT AY EVEN EXECUTION RATHER THAN HAVE LEFT MY
MISERABLE SECRET AS A FAMILY BLOT TO MY CHILDREN
YOU ARE THE FIRST WHO HAVE EVER HEARD MY STORY MY FATHER WAS A
SCHOOLMASTER IN CHESTERFIELD WHERE I RECEIVED AN EXCELLENT
EDUCATION I TRAVELLED IN MY YOUTH TOOK TO THE STAGE AND FINALLY
BECAME A REPORTER ON AN EVENING PAPER IN LONDON ONE DAY MY EDITOR
WISHED TO HAVE A SERIES OF ARTICLES UPON BEGGING IN THE METROPOLIS
AND I VOLUNTEERED TO SUPPLY THEM THERE WAS THE POINT FROM WHICH ALL
MY ADVENTURES STARTED IT WAS ONLY BY TRYING BEGGING AS AN AMATEUR
THAT I COULD GET THE FACTS UPON WHICH TO BASE MY ARTICLES WHEN AN
ACTOR I HAD OF COURSE LEARNED ALL THE SECRETS OF MAKING UP AND HAD
BEEN FAMOUS IN THE GREENROOM FOR MY SKILL I TOOK ADVANTAGE NOW OF
MY ATTAINMENTS I PAINTED MY FACE AND TO MAKE MYSELF AS PITIABLE AS
POSSIBLE I MADE A GOOD SCAR AND FIXED ONE SIDE OF MY LIP IN A TWIST
BY THE AID OF A SMALL SLIP OF FLESHCOLOURED PLASTER THEN WITH A RED
HEAD OF HAIR AND AN APPROPRIATE DRESS I TOOK MY STATION IN THE
BUSINESS PART OF THE CITY OSTENSIBLY AS A MATCHSELLER BUT REALLY AS
A BEGGAR FOR SEVEN HOURS I PLIED MY TRADE AND WHEN I RETURNED HOME
IN THE EVENING I FOUND TO MY SURPRISE THAT I HAD RECEIVED NO LESS
THAN S D
I WROTE MY ARTICLES AND THOUGHT LITTLE MORE OF THE MATTER UNTIL
SOME TIME LATER I BACKED A BILL FOR A FRIEND AND HAD A WRIT SERVED
UPON ME FOR I WAS AT MY WITS END WHERE TO GET THE MONEY BUT A
SUDDEN IDEA CAME TO ME I BEGGED A FORTNIGHTS GRACE FROM THE
CREDITOR ASKED FOR A HOLIDAY FROM MY EMPLOYERS AND SPENT THE TIME
IN BEGGING IN THE CITY UNDER MY DISGUISE IN TEN DAYS I HAD THE MONEY
AND HAD PAID THE DEBT
WELL YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WAS TO SETTLE DOWN TO ARDUOUS WORK
AT A WEEK WHEN I KNEW THAT I COULD EARN AS MUCH IN A DAY BY
SMEARING MY FACE WITH A LITTLE PAINT LAYING MY CAP ON THE GROUND
AND SITTING STILL IT WAS A LONG FIGHT BETWEEN MY PRIDE AND THE
MONEY BUT THE DOLLARS WON AT LAST AND I THREW UP REPORTING AND SAT
DAY AFTER DAY IN THE CORNER WHICH I HAD FIRST CHOSEN INSPIRING PITY
BY MY GHASTLY FACE AND FILLING MY POCKETS WITH COPPERS ONLY ONE MAN
KNEW MY SECRET HE WAS THE KEEPER OF A LOW DEN IN WHICH I USED TO
LODGE IN SWANDAM LANE WHERE I COULD EVERY MORNING EMERGE AS A
SQUALID BEGGAR AND IN THE EVENINGS TRANSFORM MYSELF INTO A
WELLDRESSED MAN ABOUT TOWN THIS FELLOW A LASCAR WAS WELL PAID BY
ME FOR HIS ROOMS SO THAT I KNEW THAT MY SECRET WAS SAFE IN HIS
POSSESSION
WELL VERY SOON I FOUND THAT I WAS SAVING CONSIDERABLE SUMS OF
MONEY I DO NOT MEAN THAT ANY BEGGAR IN THE STREETS OF LONDON COULD
EARN A YEARWHICH IS LESS THAN MY AVERAGE TAKINGSBUT I HAD
EXCEPTIONAL ADVANTAGES IN MY POWER OF MAKING UP AND ALSO IN A
FACILITY OF REPARTEE WHICH IMPROVED BY PRACTICE AND MADE ME QUITE A
RECOGNISED CHARACTER IN THE CITY ALL DAY A STREAM OF PENNIES VARIED
BY SILVER POURED IN UPON ME AND IT WAS A VERY BAD DAY IN WHICH I
FAILED TO TAKE AS I GREW RICHER I GREW MORE AMBITIOUS TOOK A HOUSE IN
THE COUNTRY
AND EVENTUALLY MARRIED WITHOUT ANYONE HAVING A SUSPICION AS TO MY
REAL OCCUPATION MY DEAR WIFE KNEW THAT I HAD BUSINESS IN THE CITY
SHE LITTLE KNEW WHAT
LAST MONDAY I HAD FINISHED FOR THE DAY AND WAS DRESSING IN MY ROOM
ABOVE THE OPIUM DEN WHEN I LOOKED OUT OF MY WINDOW AND SAW TO MY
HORROR AND ASTONISHMENT THAT MY WIFE WAS STANDING IN THE STREET
WITH HER EYES FIXED FULL UPON ME I GAVE A CRY OF SURPRISE THREW UP
MY ARMS TO COVER MY FACE AND RUSHING TO MY CONFIDANT THE LASCAR
ENTREATED HIM TO PREVENT ANYONE FROM COMING UP TO ME I HEARD HER
VOICE DOWNSTAIRS BUT I KNEW THAT SHE COULD NOT ASCEND SWIFTLY I
THREW OFF MY CLOTHES PULLED ON THOSE OF A BEGGAR AND PUT ON MY
PIGMENTS AND WIG EVEN A WIFES EYES COULD NOT PIERCE SO COMPLETE A
DISGUISE BUT THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SEARCH IN
THE ROOM AND THAT THE CLOTHES MIGHT BETRAY ME I THREW OPEN THE
WINDOW REOPENING BY MY VIOLENCE A SMALL CUT WHICH I HAD INFLICTED
UPON MYSELF IN THE BEDROOM THAT MORNING THEN I SEIZED MY COAT WHICH
WAS WEIGHTED BY THE COPPERS WHICH I HAD JUST TRANSFERRED TO IT FROM
THE LEATHER BAG IN WHICH I CARRIED MY TAKINGS I HURLED IT OUT OF THE
WINDOW AND IT DISAPPEARED INTO THE THAMES THE OTHER CLOTHES WOULD
HAVE FOLLOWED BUT AT THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A RUSH OF CONSTABLES UP
THE STAIR AND A FEW MINUTES AFTER I FOUND RATHER I CONFESS TO MY
RELIEF THAT INSTEAD OF BEING IDENTIFIED AS MR NEVILLE ST CLAIR I
WAS ARRESTED AS HIS MURDERER
I DO NOT KNOW THAT THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE FOR ME TO EXPLAIN I WAS
DETERMINED TO PRESERVE MY DISGUISE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND HENCE MY
PREFERENCE FOR A DIRTY FACE KNOWING THAT MY WIFE WOULD BE TERRIBLY
ANXIOUS I SLIPPED OFF MY RING AND CONFIDED IT TO THE LASCAR AT A
MOMENT WHEN NO CONSTABLE WAS WATCHING ME TOGETHER WITH A HURRIED
SCRAWL TELLING HER THAT SHE HAD NO CAUSE TO FEAR
THAT NOTE ONLY REACHED HER YESTERDAY SAID HOLMES
GOOD GOD WHAT A WEEK SHE MUST HAVE SPENT
THE POLICE HAVE WATCHED THIS LASCAR SAID INSPECTOR BRADSTREET
AND I CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT HE MIGHT FIND IT DIFFICULT TO POST A
LETTER UNOBSERVED PROBABLY HE HANDED IT TO SOME SAILOR CUSTOMER OF
HIS WHO FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT FOR SOME DAYS
THAT WAS IT SAID HOLMES NODDING APPROVINGLY I HAVE NO DOUBT OF
IT BUT HAVE YOU NEVER BEEN PROSECUTED FOR BEGGING
MANY TIMES BUT WHAT WAS A FINE TO ME
IT MUST STOP HERE HOWEVER SAID BRADSTREET IF THE POLICE ARE TO
HUSH THIS THING UP THERE MUST BE NO MORE OF HUGH BOONE
I HAVE SWORN IT BY THE MOST SOLEMN OATHS WHICH A MAN CAN TAKE
IN THAT CASE I THINK THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT NO FURTHER STEPS MAY
BE TAKEN BUT IF YOU ARE FOUND AGAIN THEN ALL MUST COME OUT I AM
SURE MR HOLMES THAT WE ARE VERY MUCH INDEBTED TO YOU FOR HAVING
CLEARED THE MATTER UP I WISH I KNEW HOW YOU REACH YOUR RESULTS
I REACHED THIS ONE SAID MY FRIEND BY SITTING UPON FIVE PILLOWS
AND CONSUMING AN OUNCE OF SHAG I THINK WATSON THAT IF WE DRIVE TO
BAKER STREET WE SHALL JUST BE IN TIME FOR BREAKFAST
THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
I HAD CALLED UPON MY FRIEND SHERLOCK HOLMES UPON THE SECOND MORNING
AFTER CHRISTMAS WITH THE INTENTION OF WISHING HIM THE COMPLIMENTS OF
THE SEASON HE WAS LOUNGING UPON THE SOFA IN A PURPLE DRESSINGGOWN
A PIPERACK WITHIN HIS REACH UPON THE RIGHT AND A PILE OF CRUMPLED
MORNING PAPERS EVIDENTLY NEWLY STUDIED NEAR AT HAND BESIDE THE
COUCH WAS A WOODEN CHAIR AND ON THE ANGLE OF THE BACK HUNG A VERY
SEEDY AND DISREPUTABLE HARDFELT HAT MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR AND
CRACKED IN SEVERAL PLACES A LENS AND A FORCEPS LYING UPON THE SEAT
OF THE CHAIR SUGGESTED THAT THE HAT HAD BEEN SUSPENDED IN THIS MANNER
FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXAMINATION
YOU ARE ENGAGED SAID I PERHAPS I INTERRUPT YOU
NOT AT ALL I AM GLAD TO HAVE A FRIEND WITH WHOM I CAN DISCUSS MY
RESULTS THE MATTER IS A PERFECTLY TRIVIAL ONEHE JERKED HIS THUMB
IN THE DIRECTION OF THE OLD HATBUT THERE ARE POINTS IN CONNECTION
WITH IT WHICH ARE NOT ENTIRELY DEVOID OF INTEREST AND EVEN OF
INSTRUCTION
I SEATED MYSELF IN HIS ARMCHAIR AND WARMED MY HANDS BEFORE HIS
CRACKLING FIRE FOR A SHARP FROST HAD SET IN AND THE WINDOWS WERE
THICK WITH THE ICE CRYSTALS I SUPPOSE I REMARKED THAT HOMELY
AS IT LOOKS THIS THING HAS SOME DEADLY STORY LINKED ON TO ITTHAT
IT IS THE CLUE WHICH WILL GUIDE YOU IN THE SOLUTION OF SOME MYSTERY
AND THE PUNISHMENT OF SOME CRIME
NO NO NO CRIME SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES LAUGHING ONLY ONE OF
THOSE WHIMSICAL LITTLE INCIDENTS WHICH WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU HAVE FOUR
MILLION HUMAN BEINGS ALL JOSTLING EACH OTHER WITHIN THE SPACE OF A
FEW SQUARE MILES AMID THE ACTION AND REACTION OF SO DENSE A SWARM OF
HUMANITY EVERY POSSIBLE COMBINATION OF EVENTS MAY BE EXPECTED TO
TAKE PLACE AND MANY A LITTLE PROBLEM WILL BE PRESENTED WHICH MAY BE
STRIKING AND BIZARRE WITHOUT BEING CRIMINAL WE HAVE ALREADY HAD
EXPERIENCE OF SUCH
SO MUCH SO I REMARKED THAT OF THE LAST SIX CASES WHICH I HAVE
ADDED TO MY NOTES THREE HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY FREE OF ANY LEGAL CRIME
PRECISELY YOU ALLUDE TO MY ATTEMPT TO RECOVER THE IRENE ADLER
PAPERS TO THE SINGULAR CASE OF MISS MARY SUTHERLAND AND TO THE
ADVENTURE OF THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP WELL I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT
THIS SMALL MATTER WILL FALL INTO THE SAME INNOCENT CATEGORY YOU KNOW
PETERSON THE COMMISSIONAIRE YES
IT IS TO HIM THAT THIS TROPHY BELONGS
IT IS HIS HAT
NO NO HE FOUND IT ITS OWNER IS UNKNOWN I BEG THAT YOU WILL LOOK
UPON IT NOT AS A BATTERED BILLYCOCK BUT AS AN INTELLECTUAL PROBLEM
AND FIRST AS TO HOW IT CAME HERE IT ARRIVED UPON CHRISTMAS
MORNING IN COMPANY WITH A GOOD FAT GOOSE WHICH IS I HAVE NO DOUBT
ROASTING AT THIS MOMENT IN FRONT OF PETERSONS FIRE THE FACTS ARE
THESE ABOUT FOUR OCLOCK ON CHRISTMAS MORNING PETERSON WHO AS YOU
KNOW IS A VERY HONEST FELLOW WAS RETURNING FROM SOME SMALL
JOLLIFICATION AND WAS MAKING HIS WAY HOMEWARD DOWN TOTTENHAM COURT
ROAD IN FRONT OF HIM HE SAW IN THE GASLIGHT A TALLISH MAN WALKING
WITH A SLIGHT STAGGER AND CARRYING A WHITE GOOSE SLUNG OVER HIS
SHOULDER AS HE REACHED THE CORNER OF GOODGE STREET A ROW BROKE OUT
BETWEEN THIS STRANGER AND A LITTLE KNOT OF ROUGHS ONE OF THE LATTER
KNOCKED OFF THE MANS HAT ON WHICH HE RAISED HIS STICK TO DEFEND
HIMSELF AND SWINGING IT OVER HIS HEAD SMASHED THE SHOP WINDOW
BEHIND HIM PETERSON HAD RUSHED FORWARD TO PROTECT THE STRANGER FROM
HIS ASSAILANTS BUT THE MAN SHOCKED AT HAVING BROKEN THE WINDOW AND
SEEING AN OFFICIALLOOKING PERSON IN UNIFORM RUSHING TOWARDS HIM
DROPPED HIS GOOSE TOOK TO HIS HEELS AND VANISHED AMID THE LABYRINTH
OF SMALL STREETS WHICH LIE AT THE BACK OF TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD THE
ROUGHS HAD ALSO FLED AT THE APPEARANCE OF PETERSON SO THAT HE WAS
LEFT IN POSSESSION OF THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND ALSO OF THE SPOILS OF
VICTORY IN THE SHAPE OF THIS BATTERED HAT AND A MOST UNIMPEACHABLE
CHRISTMAS GOOSE
WHICH SURELY HE RESTORED TO THEIR OWNER
MY DEAR FELLOW THERE LIES THE PROBLEM IT IS TRUE THAT FOR MRS
HENRY BAKER WAS PRINTED UPON A SMALL CARD WHICH WAS TIED TO THE
BIRDS LEFT LEG AND IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE INITIALS H B ARE
LEGIBLE UPON THE LINING OF THIS HAT BUT AS THERE ARE SOME THOUSANDS
OF BAKERS AND SOME HUNDREDS OF HENRY BAKERS IN THIS CITY OF OURS IT
IS NOT EASY TO RESTORE LOST PROPERTY TO ANY ONE OF THEM
WHAT THEN DID PETERSON DO
HE BROUGHT ROUND BOTH HAT AND GOOSE TO ME ON CHRISTMAS MORNING
KNOWING THAT EVEN THE SMALLEST PROBLEMS ARE OF INTEREST TO ME THE
GOOSE WE RETAINED UNTIL THIS MORNING WHEN THERE WERE SIGNS THAT IN
SPITE OF THE SLIGHT FROST IT WOULD BE WELL THAT IT SHOULD BE EATEN
WITHOUT UNNECESSARY DELAY ITS FINDER HAS CARRIED IT OFF THEREFORE
TO FULFIL THE ULTIMATE DESTINY OF A GOOSE WHILE I CONTINUE TO RETAIN
THE HAT OF THE UNKNOWN GENTLEMAN WHO LOST HIS CHRISTMAS DINNER
DID HE NOT ADVERTISE
NO
THEN WHAT CLUE COULD YOU HAVE AS TO HIS IDENTITY
ONLY AS MUCH AS WE CAN DEDUCE
FROM HIS HAT
PRECISELY
BUT YOU ARE JOKING WHAT CAN YOU GATHER FROM THIS OLD BATTERED
FELT
HERE IS MY LENS YOU KNOW MY METHODS WHAT CAN YOU GATHER YOURSELF
AS TO THE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE MAN WHO HAS WORN THIS ARTICLE
I TOOK THE TATTERED OBJECT IN MY HANDS AND TURNED IT OVER RATHER
RUEFULLY IT WAS A VERY ORDINARY BLACK HAT OF THE USUAL ROUND SHAPE
HARD AND MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR THE LINING HAD BEEN OF RED SILK
BUT WAS A GOOD DEAL DISCOLOURED THERE WAS NO MAKERS NAME BUT AS
HOLMES HAD REMARKED THE INITIALS H B WERE SCRAWLED UPON ONE
SIDE IT WAS PIERCED IN THE BRIM FOR A HATSECURER BUT THE ELASTIC
WAS MISSING FOR THE REST IT WAS CRACKED EXCEEDINGLY DUSTY AND
SPOTTED IN SEVERAL PLACES ALTHOUGH THERE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SOME
ATTEMPT TO HIDE THE DISCOLOURED PATCHES BY SMEARING THEM WITH INK
I CAN SEE NOTHING SAID I HANDING IT BACK TO MY FRIEND
ON THE CONTRARY WATSON YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING YOU FAIL HOWEVER
TO REASON FROM WHAT YOU SEE YOU ARE TOO TIMID IN DRAWING YOUR
INFERENCES
THEN PRAY TELL ME WHAT IT IS THAT YOU CAN INFER FROM THIS HAT
HE PICKED IT UP AND GAZED AT IT IN THE PECULIAR INTROSPECTIVE FASHION
WHICH WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM IT IS PERHAPS LESS SUGGESTIVE THAN
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HE REMARKED AND YET THERE ARE A FEW INFERENCES
WHICH ARE VERY DISTINCT AND A FEW OTHERS WHICH REPRESENT AT LEAST A
STRONG BALANCE OF PROBABILITY THAT THE MAN WAS HIGHLY INTELLECTUAL
IS OF COURSE OBVIOUS UPON THE FACE OF IT AND ALSO THAT HE WAS FAIRLY
WELLTODO WITHIN THE LAST THREE YEARS ALTHOUGH HE HAS NOW FALLEN
UPON EVIL DAYS HE HAD FORESIGHT BUT HAS LESS NOW THAN FORMERLY
POINTING TO A MORAL RETROGRESSION WHICH WHEN TAKEN WITH THE DECLINE
OF HIS FORTUNES SEEMS TO INDICATE SOME EVIL INFLUENCE PROBABLY
DRINK AT WORK UPON HIM THIS MAY ACCOUNT ALSO FOR THE OBVIOUS FACT
THAT HIS WIFE HAS CEASED TO LOVE HIM
MY DEAR HOLMES
HE HAS HOWEVER RETAINED SOME DEGREE OF SELFRESPECT HE
CONTINUED DISREGARDING MY REMONSTRANCE HE IS A MAN WHO LEADS A
SEDENTARY LIFE GOES OUT LITTLE IS OUT OF TRAINING ENTIRELY IS
MIDDLEAGED HAS GRIZZLED HAIR WHICH HE HAS HAD CUT WITHIN THE LAST
FEW DAYS AND WHICH HE ANOINTS WITH LIMECREAM THESE ARE THE MORE
PATENT FACTS WHICH ARE TO BE DEDUCED FROM HIS HAT ALSO BY THE WAY
THAT IT IS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE THAT HE HAS GAS LAID ON IN HIS
HOUSE
YOU ARE CERTAINLY JOKING HOLMES
NOT IN THE LEAST IS IT POSSIBLE THAT EVEN NOW WHEN I GIVE YOU
THESE RESULTS YOU ARE UNABLE TO SEE HOW THEY ARE ATTAINED
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I AM VERY STUPID BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I AM
UNABLE TO FOLLOW YOU FOR EXAMPLE HOW DID YOU DEDUCE THAT THIS MAN
WAS INTELLECTUAL
FOR ANSWER HOLMES CLAPPED THE HAT UPON HIS HEAD IT CAME RIGHT OVER
THE FOREHEAD AND SETTLED UPON THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE IT IS A
QUESTION OF CUBIC CAPACITY SAID HE A MAN WITH SO LARGE A BRAIN
MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN IT
THE DECLINE OF HIS FORTUNES THEN
THIS HAT IS THREE YEARS OLD THESE FLAT BRIMS CURLED AT THE EDGE
CAME IN THEN IT IS A HAT OF THE VERY BEST QUALITY LOOK AT THE BAND
OF RIBBED SILK AND THE EXCELLENT LINING IF THIS MAN COULD AFFORD TO
BUY SO EXPENSIVE A HAT THREE YEARS AGO AND HAS HAD NO HAT SINCE
THEN HE HAS ASSUREDLY GONE DOWN IN THE WORLD
WELL THAT IS CLEAR ENOUGH CERTAINLY BUT HOW ABOUT THE FORESIGHT
AND THE MORAL RETROGRESSION
SHERLOCK HOLMES LAUGHED HERE IS THE FORESIGHT SAID HE PUTTING HIS
FINGER UPON THE LITTLE DISC AND LOOP OF THE HATSECURER THEY ARE
NEVER SOLD UPON HATS IF THIS MAN ORDERED ONE IT IS A SIGN OF A
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FORESIGHT SINCE HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO TAKE
THIS PRECAUTION AGAINST THE WIND BUT SINCE WE SEE THAT HE HAS BROKEN
THE ELASTIC AND HAS NOT TROUBLED TO REPLACE IT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT HE
HAS LESS FORESIGHT NOW THAN FORMERLY WHICH IS A DISTINCT PROOF OF A
WEAKENING NATURE ON THE OTHER HAND HE HAS ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL
SOME OF THESE STAINS UPON THE FELT BY DAUBING THEM WITH INK WHICH IS
A SIGN THAT HE HAS NOT ENTIRELY LOST HIS SELFRESPECT
YOUR REASONING IS CERTAINLY PLAUSIBLE
THE FURTHER POINTS THAT HE IS MIDDLEAGED THAT HIS HAIR IS
GRIZZLED THAT IT HAS BEEN RECENTLY CUT AND THAT HE USES LIMECREAM
ARE ALL TO BE GATHERED FROM A CLOSE EXAMINATION OF THE LOWER PART OF
THE LINING THE LENS DISCLOSES A LARGE NUMBER OF HAIRENDS CLEAN CUT
BY THE SCISSORS OF THE BARBER THEY ALL APPEAR TO BE ADHESIVE AND
THERE IS A DISTINCT ODOUR OF LIMECREAM THIS DUST YOU WILL OBSERVE
IS NOT THE GRITTY GREY DUST OF THE STREET BUT THE FLUFFY BROWN DUST
OF THE HOUSE SHOWING THAT IT HAS BEEN HUNG UP INDOORS MOST OF THE
TIME WHILE THE MARKS OF MOISTURE UPON THE INSIDE ARE PROOF POSITIVE
THAT THE WEARER PERSPIRED VERY FREELY AND COULD THEREFORE HARDLY BE
IN THE BEST OF TRAINING
BUT HIS WIFEYOU SAID THAT SHE HAD CEASED TO LOVE HIM
THIS HAT HAS NOT BEEN BRUSHED FOR WEEKS WHEN I SEE YOU MY DEAR
WATSON WITH A WEEKS ACCUMULATION OF DUST UPON YOUR HAT AND WHEN
YOUR WIFE ALLOWS YOU TO GO OUT IN SUCH A STATE I SHALL FEAR THAT YOU
ALSO HAVE BEEN UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO LOSE YOUR WIFES AFFECTION
BUT HE MIGHT BE A BACHELOR
NAY HE WAS BRINGING HOME THE GOOSE AS A PEACEOFFERING TO HIS WIFE
REMEMBER THE CARD UPON THE BIRDS LEG
YOU HAVE AN ANSWER TO EVERYTHING BUT HOW ON EARTH DO YOU DEDUCE
THAT THE GAS IS NOT LAID ON IN HIS HOUSE
ONE TALLOW STAIN OR EVEN TWO MIGHT COME BY CHANCE BUT WHEN I SEE
NO LESS THAN FIVE I THINK THAT THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE
INDIVIDUAL MUST BE BROUGHT INTO FREQUENT CONTACT WITH BURNING
TALLOWWALKS UPSTAIRS AT NIGHT PROBABLY WITH HIS HAT IN ONE HAND AND
A GUTTERING CANDLE IN THE OTHER ANYHOW HE NEVER GOT TALLOWSTAINS
FROM A GASJET ARE YOU SATISFIED
WELL IT IS VERY INGENIOUS SAID I LAUGHING BUT SINCE AS YOU
SAID JUST NOW THERE HAS BEEN NO CRIME COMMITTED AND NO HARM DONE
SAVE THE LOSS OF A GOOSE ALL THIS SEEMS TO BE RATHER A WASTE OF
ENERGY
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD OPENED HIS MOUTH TO REPLY WHEN THE DOOR FLEW
OPEN AND PETERSON THE COMMISSIONAIRE RUSHED INTO THE APARTMENT
WITH FLUSHED CHEEKS AND THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS DAZED WITH
ASTONISHMENT
THE GOOSE MR HOLMES THE GOOSE SIR HE GASPED
EH WHAT OF IT THEN HAS IT RETURNED TO LIFE AND FLAPPED OFF
THROUGH THE KITCHEN WINDOW HOLMES TWISTED HIMSELF ROUND UPON THE
SOFA TO GET A FAIRER VIEW OF THE MANS EXCITED FACE
SEE HERE SIR SEE WHAT MY WIFE FOUND IN ITS CROP HE HELD OUT HIS
HAND AND DISPLAYED UPON THE CENTRE OF THE PALM A BRILLIANTLY
SCINTILLATING BLUE STONE RATHER SMALLER THAN A BEAN IN SIZE BUT OF
SUCH PURITY AND RADIANCE THAT IT TWINKLED LIKE AN ELECTRIC POINT IN
THE DARK HOLLOW OF HIS HAND
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT UP WITH A WHISTLE BY JOVE PETERSON SAID HE
THIS IS TREASURE TROVE INDEED I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE
GOT
A DIAMOND SIR A PRECIOUS STONE IT CUTS INTO GLASS AS THOUGH IT
WERE PUTTY
ITS MORE THAN A PRECIOUS STONE IT IS THE PRECIOUS STONE
NOT THE COUNTESS OF MORCARS BLUE CARBUNCLE I EJACULATED
PRECISELY SO I OUGHT TO KNOW ITS SIZE AND SHAPE SEEING THAT I HAVE
READ THE ADVERTISEMENT ABOUT IT IN THE TIMES EVERY DAY LATELY IT IS
ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE AND ITS VALUE CAN ONLY BE CONJECTURED BUT THE
REWARD OFFERED OF IS CERTAINLY NOT WITHIN A TWENTIETH PART OF
THE MARKET PRICE
A THOUSAND POUNDS GREAT LORD OF MERCY THE COMMISSIONAIRE PLUMPED
DOWN INTO A CHAIR AND STARED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US
THAT IS THE REWARD AND I HAVE REASON TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE
SENTIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE BACKGROUND WHICH WOULD INDUCE THE
COUNTESS TO PART WITH HALF HER FORTUNE IF SHE COULD BUT RECOVER THE
GEM
IT WAS LOST IF I REMEMBER ARIGHT AT THE HOTEL COSMOPOLITAN I
REMARKED
PRECISELY SO ON DECEMBER ND JUST FIVE DAYS AGO JOHN HORNER A
PLUMBER WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING ABSTRACTED IT FROM THE LADYS
JEWELCASE THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM WAS SO STRONG THAT THE CASE HAS
BEEN REFERRED TO THE ASSIZES I HAVE SOME ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER HERE
I BELIEVE HE RUMMAGED AMID HIS NEWSPAPERS GLANCING OVER THE DATES
UNTIL AT LAST HE SMOOTHED ONE OUT DOUBLED IT OVER AND READ THE
FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH
HOTEL COSMOPOLITAN JEWEL ROBBERY JOHN HORNER PLUMBER WAS
BROUGHT UP UPON THE CHARGE OF HAVING UPON THE ND INST ABSTRACTED
FROM THE JEWELCASE OF THE COUNTESS OF MORCAR THE VALUABLE GEM KNOWN
AS THE BLUE CARBUNCLE JAMES RYDER UPPERATTENDANT AT THE HOTEL
GAVE HIS EVIDENCE TO THE EFFECT THAT HE HAD SHOWN HORNER UP TO THE
DRESSINGROOM OF THE COUNTESS OF MORCAR UPON THE DAY OF THE ROBBERY
IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT SOLDER THE SECOND BAR OF THE GRATE WHICH WAS
LOOSE HE HAD REMAINED WITH HORNER SOME LITTLE TIME BUT HAD FINALLY
BEEN CALLED AWAY ON RETURNING HE FOUND THAT HORNER HAD DISAPPEARED
THAT THE BUREAU HAD BEEN FORCED OPEN AND THAT THE SMALL MOROCCO
CASKET IN WHICH AS IT AFTERWARDS TRANSPIRED THE COUNTESS WAS
ACCUSTOMED TO KEEP HER JEWEL WAS LYING EMPTY UPON THE
DRESSINGTABLE RYDER INSTANTLY GAVE THE ALARM AND HORNER WAS
ARRESTED THE SAME EVENING BUT THE STONE COULD NOT BE FOUND EITHER
UPON HIS PERSON OR IN HIS ROOMS CATHERINE CUSACK MAID TO THE
COUNTESS DEPOSED TO HAVING HEARD RYDERS CRY OF DISMAY ON
DISCOVERING THE ROBBERY AND TO HAVING RUSHED INTO THE ROOM WHERE
SHE FOUND MATTERS AS DESCRIBED BY THE LAST WITNESS INSPECTOR
BRADSTREET B DIVISION GAVE EVIDENCE AS TO THE ARREST OF HORNER WHO
STRUGGLED FRANTICALLY AND PROTESTED HIS INNOCENCE IN THE STRONGEST
TERMS EVIDENCE OF A PREVIOUS CONVICTION FOR ROBBERY HAVING BEEN
GIVEN AGAINST THE PRISONER THE MAGISTRATE REFUSED TO DEAL SUMMARILY
WITH THE OFFENCE BUT REFERRED IT TO THE ASSIZES HORNER WHO HAD
SHOWN SIGNS OF INTENSE EMOTION DURING THE PROCEEDINGS FAINTED AWAY
AT THE CONCLUSION AND WAS CARRIED OUT OF COURT
HUM SO MUCH FOR THE POLICECOURT SAID HOLMES THOUGHTFULLY
TOSSING ASIDE THE PAPER THE QUESTION FOR US NOW TO SOLVE IS THE
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS LEADING FROM A RIFLED JEWELCASE AT ONE END TO THE
CROP OF A GOOSE IN TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD AT THE OTHER YOU SEE
WATSON OUR LITTLE DEDUCTIONS HAVE SUDDENLY ASSUMED A MUCH MORE
IMPORTANT AND LESS INNOCENT ASPECT HERE IS THE STONE THE STONE CAME
FROM THE GOOSE AND THE GOOSE CAME FROM MR HENRY BAKER THE
GENTLEMAN WITH THE BAD HAT AND ALL THE OTHER CHARACTERISTICS WITH
WHICH I HAVE BORED YOU SO NOW WE MUST SET OURSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY
TO FINDING THIS GENTLEMAN AND ASCERTAINING WHAT PART HE HAS PLAYED IN
THIS LITTLE MYSTERY TO DO THIS WE MUST TRY THE SIMPLEST MEANS
FIRST AND THESE LIE UNDOUBTEDLY IN AN ADVERTISEMENT IN ALL THE
EVENING PAPERS IF THIS FAIL I SHALL HAVE RECOURSE TO OTHER
METHODS
WHAT WILL YOU SAY
GIVE ME A PENCIL AND THAT SLIP OF PAPER NOW THEN FOUND AT THE
CORNER OF GOODGE STREET A GOOSE AND A BLACK FELT HAT MR HENRY
BAKER CAN HAVE THE SAME BY APPLYING AT THIS EVENING AT B
BAKER STREET THAT IS CLEAR AND CONCISE
VERY BUT WILL HE SEE IT
WELL HE IS SURE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE PAPERS SINCE TO A POOR MAN
THE LOSS WAS A HEAVY ONE HE WAS CLEARLY SO SCARED BY HIS MISCHANCE
IN BREAKING THE WINDOW AND BY THE APPROACH OF PETERSON THAT HE
THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT FLIGHT BUT SINCE THEN HE MUST HAVE BITTERLY
REGRETTED THE IMPULSE WHICH CAUSED HIM TO DROP HIS BIRD THEN AGAIN
THE INTRODUCTION OF HIS NAME WILL CAUSE HIM TO SEE IT FOR EVERYONE
WHO KNOWS HIM WILL DIRECT HIS ATTENTION TO IT HERE YOU ARE
PETERSON RUN DOWN TO THE ADVERTISING AGENCY AND HAVE THIS PUT IN THE
EVENING PAPERS
IN WHICH SIR
OH IN THE GLOBE STAR PALL MALL ST JAMESS EVENING NEWS
STANDARD ECHO AND ANY OTHERS THAT OCCUR TO YOU
VERY WELL SIR AND THIS STONE
AH YES I SHALL KEEP THE STONE THANK YOU AND I SAY PETERSON
JUST BUY A GOOSE ON YOUR WAY BACK AND LEAVE IT HERE WITH ME FOR WE
MUST HAVE ONE TO GIVE TO THIS GENTLEMAN IN PLACE OF THE ONE WHICH
YOUR FAMILY IS NOW DEVOURING
WHEN THE COMMISSIONAIRE HAD GONE HOLMES TOOK UP THE STONE AND HELD
IT AGAINST THE LIGHT ITS A BONNY THING SAID HE JUST SEE HOW IT
GLINTS AND SPARKLES OF COURSE IT IS A NUCLEUS AND FOCUS OF CRIME
EVERY GOOD STONE IS THEY ARE THE DEVILS PET BAITS IN THE LARGER
AND OLDER JEWELS EVERY FACET MAY STAND FOR A BLOODY DEED THIS STONE
IS NOT YET TWENTY YEARS OLD IT WAS FOUND IN THE BANKS OF THE AMOY
RIVER IN SOUTHERN CHINA AND IS REMARKABLE IN HAVING EVERY
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CARBUNCLE SAVE THAT IT IS BLUE IN SHADE
INSTEAD OF RUBY RED IN SPITE OF ITS YOUTH IT HAS ALREADY A SINISTER
HISTORY THERE HAVE BEEN TWO MURDERS A VITRIOLTHROWING A SUICIDE
AND SEVERAL ROBBERIES BROUGHT ABOUT FOR THE SAKE OF THIS FORTYGRAIN
WEIGHT OF CRYSTALLISED CHARCOAL WHO WOULD THINK THAT SO PRETTY A TOY
WOULD BE A PURVEYOR TO THE GALLOWS AND THE PRISON ILL LOCK IT UP IN
MY STRONG BOX NOW AND DROP A LINE TO THE COUNTESS TO SAY THAT WE HAVE
IT
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS MAN HORNER IS INNOCENT
I CANNOT TELL
WELL THEN DO YOU IMAGINE THAT THIS OTHER ONE HENRY BAKER HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MATTER
IT IS I THINK MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT HENRY BAKER IS AN ABSOLUTELY
INNOCENT MAN WHO HAD NO IDEA THAT THE BIRD WHICH HE WAS CARRYING WAS
OF CONSIDERABLY MORE VALUE THAN IF IT WERE MADE OF SOLID GOLD THAT
HOWEVER I SHALL DETERMINE BY A VERY SIMPLE TEST IF WE HAVE AN ANSWER
TO OUR ADVERTISEMENT
AND YOU CAN DO NOTHING UNTIL THEN
NOTHING
IN THAT CASE I SHALL CONTINUE MY PROFESSIONAL ROUND BUT I SHALL
COME BACK IN THE EVENING AT THE HOUR YOU HAVE MENTIONED FOR I SHOULD
LIKE TO SEE THE SOLUTION OF SO TANGLED A BUSINESS
VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU I DINE AT SEVEN THERE IS A WOODCOCK I
BELIEVE BY THE WAY IN VIEW OF RECENT OCCURRENCES PERHAPS I OUGHT
TO ASK MRS HUDSON TO EXAMINE ITS CROP
I HAD BEEN DELAYED AT A CASE AND IT WAS A LITTLE AFTER HALFPAST SIX
WHEN I FOUND MYSELF IN BAKER STREET ONCE MORE AS I APPROACHED THE
HOUSE I SAW A TALL MAN IN A SCOTCH BONNET WITH A COAT WHICH WAS
BUTTONED UP TO HIS CHIN WAITING OUTSIDE IN THE BRIGHT SEMICIRCLE
WHICH WAS THROWN FROM THE FANLIGHT JUST AS I ARRIVED THE DOOR WAS
OPENED AND WE WERE SHOWN UP TOGETHER TO HOLMES ROOM
MR HENRY BAKER I BELIEVE SAID HE RISING FROM HIS ARMCHAIR AND
GREETING HIS VISITOR WITH THE EASY AIR OF GENIALITY WHICH HE COULD SO
READILY ASSUME PRAY TAKE THIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE MR BAKER IT IS A
COLD NIGHT AND I OBSERVE THAT YOUR CIRCULATION IS MORE ADAPTED FOR
SUMMER THAN FOR WINTER AH WATSON YOU HAVE JUST COME AT THE RIGHT
TIME IS THAT YOUR HAT MR BAKER
YES SIR THAT IS UNDOUBTEDLY MY HAT
HE WAS A LARGE MAN WITH ROUNDED SHOULDERS A MASSIVE HEAD AND A
BROAD INTELLIGENT FACE SLOPING DOWN TO A POINTED BEARD OF GRIZZLED
BROWN A TOUCH OF RED IN NOSE AND CHEEKS WITH A SLIGHT TREMOR OF HIS
EXTENDED HAND RECALLED HOLMES SURMISE AS TO HIS HABITS HIS RUSTY
BLACK FROCKCOAT WAS BUTTONED RIGHT UP IN FRONT WITH THE COLLAR
TURNED UP AND HIS LANK WRISTS PROTRUDED FROM HIS SLEEVES WITHOUT A
SIGN OF CUFF OR SHIRT HE SPOKE IN A SLOW STACCATO FASHION CHOOSING
HIS WORDS WITH CARE AND GAVE THE IMPRESSION GENERALLY OF A MAN OF
LEARNING AND LETTERS WHO HAD HAD ILLUSAGE AT THE HANDS OF FORTUNE
WE HAVE RETAINED THESE THINGS FOR SOME DAYS SAID HOLMES BECAUSE
WE EXPECTED TO SEE AN ADVERTISEMENT FROM YOU GIVING YOUR ADDRESS I
AM AT A LOSS TO KNOW NOW WHY YOU DID NOT ADVERTISE
OUR VISITOR GAVE A RATHER SHAMEFACED LAUGH SHILLINGS HAVE NOT BEEN
SO PLENTIFUL WITH ME AS THEY ONCE WERE HE REMARKED I HAD NO DOUBT
THAT THE GANG OF ROUGHS WHO ASSAULTED ME HAD CARRIED OFF BOTH MY HAT
AND THE BIRD I DID NOT CARE TO SPEND MORE MONEY IN A HOPELESS
ATTEMPT AT RECOVERING THEM
VERY NATURALLY BY THE WAY ABOUT THE BIRD WE WERE COMPELLED TO EAT
IT
TO EAT IT OUR VISITOR HALF ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR IN HIS EXCITEMENT
YES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OF NO USE TO ANYONE HAD WE NOT DONE SO BUT
I PRESUME THAT THIS OTHER GOOSE UPON THE SIDEBOARD WHICH IS ABOUT
THE SAME WEIGHT AND PERFECTLY FRESH WILL ANSWER YOUR PURPOSE EQUALLY
WELL
OH CERTAINLY CERTAINLY ANSWERED MR BAKER WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
OF COURSE WE STILL HAVE THE FEATHERS LEGS CROP AND SO ON OF YOUR
OWN BIRD SO IF YOU WISH
THE MAN BURST INTO A HEARTY LAUGH THEY MIGHT BE USEFUL TO ME AS
RELICS OF MY ADVENTURE SAID HE BUT BEYOND THAT I CAN HARDLY SEE
WHAT USE THE DISJECTA MEMBRA OF MY LATE ACQUAINTANCE ARE GOING TO BE
TO ME NO SIR I THINK THAT WITH YOUR PERMISSION I WILL CONFINE MY
ATTENTIONS TO THE EXCELLENT BIRD WHICH I PERCEIVE UPON THE
SIDEBOARD
SHERLOCK HOLMES GLANCED SHARPLY ACROSS AT ME WITH A SLIGHT SHRUG OF
HIS SHOULDERS
THERE IS YOUR HAT THEN AND THERE YOUR BIRD SAID HE BY THE WAY
WOULD IT BORE YOU TO TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT THE OTHER ONE FROM I AM
SOMEWHAT OF A FOWL FANCIER AND I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A BETTER GROWN
GOOSE
CERTAINLY SIR SAID BAKER WHO HAD RISEN AND TUCKED HIS NEWLY
GAINED PROPERTY UNDER HIS ARM THERE ARE A FEW OF US WHO FREQUENT
THE ALPHA INN NEAR THE MUSEUMWE ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE MUSEUM
ITSELF DURING THE DAY YOU UNDERSTAND THIS YEAR OUR GOOD HOST
WINDIGATE BY NAME INSTITUTED A GOOSE CLUB BY WHICH ON
CONSIDERATION OF SOME FEW PENCE EVERY WEEK WE WERE EACH TO RECEIVE A
BIRD AT CHRISTMAS MY PENCE WERE DULY PAID AND THE REST IS FAMILIAR
TO YOU I AM MUCH INDEBTED TO YOU SIR FOR A SCOTCH BONNET IS FITTED
NEITHER TO MY YEARS NOR MY GRAVITY WITH A COMICAL POMPOSITY OF
MANNER HE BOWED SOLEMNLY TO BOTH OF US AND STRODE OFF UPON HIS WAY
SO MUCH FOR MR HENRY BAKER SAID HOLMES WHEN HE HAD CLOSED THE
DOOR BEHIND HIM IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT HE KNOWS NOTHING WHATEVER
ABOUT THE MATTER ARE YOU HUNGRY WATSON
NOT PARTICULARLY
THEN I SUGGEST THAT WE TURN OUR DINNER INTO A SUPPER AND FOLLOW UP
THIS CLUE WHILE IT IS STILL HOT
BY ALL MEANS
IT WAS A BITTER NIGHT SO WE DREW ON OUR ULSTERS AND WRAPPED CRAVATS
ABOUT OUR THROATS OUTSIDE THE STARS WERE SHINING COLDLY IN A
CLOUDLESS SKY AND THE BREATH OF THE PASSERSBY BLEW OUT INTO SMOKE
LIKE SO MANY PISTOL SHOTS OUR FOOTFALLS RANG OUT CRISPLY AND LOUDLY
AS WE SWUNG THROUGH THE DOCTORS QUARTER WIMPOLE STREET HARLEY
STREET AND SO THROUGH WIGMORE STREET INTO OXFORD STREET IN A
QUARTER OF AN HOUR WE WERE IN BLOOMSBURY AT THE ALPHA INN WHICH IS A
SMALL PUBLICHOUSE AT THE CORNER OF ONE OF THE STREETS WHICH RUNS
DOWN INTO HOLBORN HOLMES PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR OF THE PRIVATE BAR AND
ORDERED TWO GLASSES OF BEER FROM THE RUDDYFACED WHITEAPRONED
LANDLORD
YOUR BEER SHOULD BE EXCELLENT IF IT IS AS GOOD AS YOUR GEESE SAID
HE

AH I DONT KNOW HIM WELL HERES YOUR GOOD HEALTH LANDLORD AND
PROSPERITY TO YOUR HOUSE GOODNIGHT
NOW FOR MR BRECKINRIDGE HE CONTINUED BUTTONING UP HIS COAT AS WE
CAME OUT INTO THE FROSTY AIR REMEMBER WATSON THAT THOUGH WE HAVE
SO HOMELY A THING AS A GOOSE AT ONE END OF THIS CHAIN WE HAVE AT THE
OTHER A MAN WHO WILL CERTAINLY GET SEVEN YEARS PENAL SERVITUDE
UNLESS WE CAN ESTABLISH HIS INNOCENCE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR
INQUIRY MAY BUT CONFIRM HIS GUILT BUT IN ANY CASE WE HAVE A LINE
OF INVESTIGATION WHICH HAS BEEN MISSED BY THE POLICE AND WHICH A
SINGULAR CHANCE HAS PLACED IN OUR HANDS LET US FOLLOW IT OUT TO THE
BITTER END FACES TO THE SOUTH THEN AND QUICK MARCH
WE PASSED ACROSS HOLBORN DOWN ENDELL STREET AND SO THROUGH A ZIGZAG
OF SLUMS TO COVENT GARDEN MARKET ONE OF THE LARGEST STALLS BORE THE
NAME OF BRECKINRIDGE UPON IT AND THE PROPRIETOR A HORSEYLOOKING
MAN WITH A SHARP FACE AND TRIM SIDEWHISKERS WAS HELPING A BOY TO
PUT UP THE SHUTTERS
GOODEVENING ITS A COLD NIGHT SAID HOLMES
THE SALESMAN NODDED AND SHOT A QUESTIONING GLANCE AT MY COMPANION
SOLD OUT OF GEESE I SEE CONTINUED HOLMES POINTING AT THE BARE
SLABS OF MARBLE

THE LANDLORD OF THE ALPHA
OH YES I SENT HIM A COUPLE OF DOZEN

SALESMAN

IT IS STRAIGHT ENOUGH I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO SOLD YOU THE GEESE
WHICH YOU SUPPLIED TO THE ALPHA
WELL THEN I SHANT TELL YOU SO NOW

I PAY GOOD MONEY FOR A GOOD ARTICLE THERE SHOULD BE AN END OF THE
BUSINESS BUT ITS WHERE ARE THE GEESE AND WHO DID YOU SELL THE
GEESE TO AND WHAT WILL YOU TAKE FOR THE GEESE ONE WOULD THINK
THEY WERE THE ONLY GEESE IN THE WORLD TO HEAR THE FUSS THAT IS MADE
OVER THEM
WELL I HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH ANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
MAKING INQUIRIES SAID HOLMES CARELESSLY IF YOU WONT TELL US THE
BET IS OFF THAT IS ALL BUT IM ALWAYS READY TO BACK MY OPINION ON A
MATTER OF FOWLS AND I HAVE A FIVER ON IT THAT THE BIRD I ATE IS
COUNTRY BRED
WELL THEN YOUVE LOST YOUR FIVER FOR ITS TOWN BRED SNAPPED THE
SALESMAN
ITS NOTHING OF THE KIND
I SAY IT IS
I DONT BELIEVE IT
DYOU THINK YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT FOWLS THAN I WHO HAVE HANDLED THEM
EVER SINCE I WAS A NIPPER I TELL YOU ALL THOSE BIRDS THAT WENT TO
THE ALPHA WERE TOWN BRED
YOULL NEVER PERSUADE ME TO BELIEVE THAT
WILL YOU BET THEN
ITS MERELY TAKING YOUR MONEY FOR I KNOW THAT I AM RIGHT BUT ILL
HAVE A SOVEREIGN ON WITH YOU JUST TO TEACH YOU NOT TO BE OBSTINATE
THE SALESMAN CHUCKLED GRIMLY BRING ME THE BOOKS BILL SAID HE
THE SMALL BOY BROUGHT ROUND A SMALL THIN VOLUME AND A GREAT
GREASYBACKED ONE LAYING THEM OUT TOGETHER BENEATH THE HANGING LAMP

SHERLOCK HOLMES LOOKED DEEPLY CHAGRINED HE DREW A SOVEREIGN FROM HIS
POCKET AND THREW IT DOWN UPON THE SLAB TURNING AWAY WITH THE AIR OF
A MAN WHOSE DISGUST IS TOO DEEP FOR WORDS A FEW YARDS OFF HE STOPPED
UNDER A LAMPPOST AND LAUGHED IN THE HEARTY NOISELESS FASHION WHICH
WAS PECULIAR TO HIM
WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE PINK UN
PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET SAID
HE I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM THAT MAN
WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM
HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER WELL WATSON WE
ARE I FANCY NEARING THE END OF OUR QUEST AND THE ONLY POINT WHICH
REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED IS WHETHER WE SHOULD GO ON TO THIS MRS
OAKSHOTT TONIGHT OR WHETHER WE SHOULD RESERVE IT FOR TOMORROW IT
IS CLEAR FROM WHAT THAT SURLY FELLOW SAID THAT THERE ARE OTHERS
BESIDES OURSELVES WHO ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT THE MATTER AND I SHOULD
HIS REMARKS WERE SUDDENLY CUT SHORT BY A LOUD HUBBUB WHICH BROKE OUT
FROM THE STALL WHICH WE HAD JUST LEFT TURNING ROUND WE SAW A LITTLE
RATFACED FELLOW STANDING IN THE CENTRE OF THE CIRCLE OF YELLOW LIGHT
WHICH WAS THROWN BY THE SWINGING LAMP WHILE BRECKINRIDGE THE
SALESMAN FRAMED IN THE DOOR OF HIS STALL WAS SHAKING HIS FISTS
FIERCELY AT THE CRINGING FIGURE
IVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU AND YOUR GEESE HE SHOUTED I WISH YOU WERE
ALL AT THE DEVIL TOGETHER IF YOU COME PESTERING ME ANY MORE WITH
YOUR SILLY TALK ILL SET THE DOG AT YOU YOU BRING MRS OAKSHOTT HERE

INQUIRER FLITTED AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS
HA THIS MAY SAVE US A VISIT TO BRIXTON ROAD WHISPERED HOLMES
COME WITH ME AND WE WILL SEE WHAT IS TO BE MADE OF THIS FELLOW
STRIDING THROUGH THE SCATTERED KNOTS OF PEOPLE WHO LOUNGED ROUND THE
FLARING STALLS MY COMPANION SPEEDILY OVERTOOK THE LITTLE MAN AND
TOUCHED HIM UPON THE SHOULDER HE SPRANG ROUND AND I COULD SEE IN
THE GASLIGHT THAT EVERY VESTIGE OF COLOUR HAD BEEN DRIVEN FROM HIS
FACE
WHO ARE YOU THEN WHAT DO YOU WANT HE ASKED IN A QUAVERING VOICE
YOU WILL EXCUSE ME SAID HOLMES BLANDLY BUT I COULD NOT HELP
OVERHEARING THE QUESTIONS WHICH YOU PUT TO THE SALESMAN JUST NOW I
THINK THAT I COULD BE OF ASSISTANCE TO YOU
YOU WHO ARE YOU HOW COULD YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF THE MATTER
MY NAME IS SHERLOCK HOLMES IT IS MY BUSINESS TO KNOW WHAT OTHER
PEOPLE DONT KNOW
BUT YOU CAN KNOW NOTHING OF THIS
EXCUSE ME I KNOW EVERYTHING OF IT YOU ARE ENDEAVOURING TO TRACE
SOME GEESE WHICH WERE SOLD BY MRS OAKSHOTT OF BRIXTON ROAD TO A
SALESMAN NAMED BRECKINRIDGE BY HIM IN TURN TO MR WINDIGATE OF THE
ALPHA AND BY HIM TO HIS CLUB OF WHICH MR HENRY BAKER IS A MEMBER
OH SIR YOU ARE THE VERY MAN WHOM I HAVE LONGED TO MEET CRIED THE
LITTLE FELLOW WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS AND QUIVERING FINGERS I CAN
HARDLY EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW INTERESTED I AM IN THIS MATTER
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAILED A FOURWHEELER WHICH WAS PASSING IN THAT
CASE WE HAD BETTER DISCUSS IT IN A COSY ROOM RATHER THAN IN THIS
WINDSWEPT MARKETPLACE SAID HE BUT PRAY TELL ME BEFORE WE GO
FARTHER WHO IT IS THAT I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF ASSISTING
THE MAN HESITATED FOR AN INSTANT MY NAME IS JOHN ROBINSON HE
ANSWERED WITH A SIDELONG GLANCE
NO NO THE REAL NAME SAID HOLMES SWEETLY IT IS ALWAYS AWKWARD
DOING BUSINESS WITH AN ALIAS
A FLUSH SPRANG TO THE WHITE CHEEKS OF THE STRANGER WELL THEN SAID
HE MY REAL NAME IS JAMES RYDER
PRECISELY SO HEAD ATTENDANT AT THE HOTEL COSMOPOLITAN PRAY STEP
INTO THE CAB AND I SHALL SOON BE ABLE TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING WHICH
YOU WOULD WISH TO KNOW
THE LITTLE MAN STOOD GLANCING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US WITH
HALFFRIGHTENED HALFHOPEFUL EYES AS ONE WHO IS NOT SURE WHETHER HE
IS ON THE VERGE OF A WINDFALL OR OF A CATASTROPHE THEN HE STEPPED
INTO THE CAB AND IN HALF AN HOUR WE WERE BACK IN THE SITTINGROOM AT
BAKER STREET NOTHING HAD BEEN SAID DURING OUR DRIVE BUT THE HIGH
THIN BREATHING OF OUR NEW COMPANION AND THE CLASPINGS AND
UNCLASPINGS OF HIS HANDS SPOKE OF THE NERVOUS TENSION WITHIN HIM
HERE WE ARE SAID HOLMES CHEERILY AS WE FILED INTO THE ROOM THE
FIRE LOOKS VERY SEASONABLE IN THIS WEATHER YOU LOOK COLD MR RYDER
PRAY TAKE THE BASKETCHAIR I WILL JUST PUT ON MY SLIPPERS BEFORE WE
SETTLE THIS LITTLE MATTER OF YOURS NOW THEN YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
BECAME OF THOSE GEESE
YES SIR
OR RATHER I FANCY OF THAT GOOSE IT WAS ONE BIRD I IMAGINE IN
WHICH YOU WERE INTERESTEDWHITE WITH A BLACK BAR ACROSS THE TAIL
RYDER QUIVERED WITH EMOTION OH SIR HE CRIED CAN YOU TELL ME
WHERE IT WENT TO
IT CAME HERE
HERE
YES AND A MOST REMARKABLE BIRD IT PROVED I DONT WONDER THAT YOU
SHOULD TAKE AN INTEREST IN IT IT LAID AN EGG AFTER IT WAS DEADTHE
BONNIEST BRIGHTEST LITTLE BLUE EGG THAT EVER WAS SEEN I HAVE IT
HERE IN MY MUSEUM
OUR VISITOR STAGGERED TO HIS FEET AND CLUTCHED THE MANTELPIECE WITH
HIS RIGHT HAND HOLMES UNLOCKED HIS STRONGBOX AND HELD UP THE BLUE
CARBUNCLE WHICH SHONE OUT LIKE A STAR WITH A COLD BRILLIANT
MANYPOINTED RADIANCE RYDER STOOD GLARING WITH A DRAWN FACE
UNCERTAIN WHETHER TO CLAIM OR TO DISOWN IT
THE GAMES UP RYDER SAID HOLMES QUIETLY HOLD UP MAN OR YOULL
BE INTO THE FIRE GIVE HIM AN ARM BACK INTO HIS CHAIR WATSON HES
NOT GOT BLOOD ENOUGH TO GO IN FOR FELONY WITH IMPUNITY GIVE HIM A
DASH OF BRANDY SO NOW HE LOOKS A LITTLE MORE HUMAN WHAT A SHRIMP
IT IS TO BE SURE
FOR A MOMENT HE HAD STAGGERED AND NEARLY FALLEN BUT THE BRANDY
BROUGHT A TINGE OF COLOUR INTO HIS CHEEKS AND HE SAT STARING WITH
FRIGHTENED EYES AT HIS ACCUSER
I HAVE ALMOST EVERY LINK IN MY HANDS AND ALL THE PROOFS WHICH I
COULD POSSIBLY NEED SO THERE IS LITTLE WHICH YOU NEED TELL ME
STILL THAT LITTLE MAY AS WELL BE CLEARED UP TO MAKE THE CASE
COMPLETE YOU HAD HEARD RYDER OF THIS BLUE STONE OF THE COUNTESS OF
MORCARS
IT WAS CATHERINE CUSACK WHO TOLD ME OF IT SAID HE IN A CRACKLING
VOICE
I SEEHER LADYSHIPS WAITINGMAID WELL THE TEMPTATION OF SUDDEN
WEALTH SO EASILY ACQUIRED WAS TOO MUCH FOR YOU AS IT HAS BEEN FOR
BETTER MEN BEFORE YOU BUT YOU WERE NOT VERY SCRUPULOUS IN THE MEANS
YOU USED IT SEEMS TO ME RYDER THAT THERE IS THE MAKING OF A VERY
PRETTY VILLAIN IN YOU YOU KNEW THAT THIS MAN HORNER THE PLUMBER
HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN SOME SUCH MATTER BEFORE AND THAT SUSPICION
WOULD REST THE MORE READILY UPON HIM WHAT DID YOU DO THEN YOU MADE
SOME SMALL JOB IN MY LADYS ROOMYOU AND YOUR CONFEDERATE
CUSACKAND YOU MANAGED THAT HE SHOULD BE THE MAN SENT FOR THEN
WHEN HE HAD LEFT YOU RIFLED THE JEWELCASE RAISED THE ALARM AND
HAD THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN ARRESTED YOU THEN
RYDER THREW HIMSELF DOWN SUDDENLY UPON THE RUG AND CLUTCHED AT MY
COMPANIONS KNEES FOR GODS SAKE HAVE MERCY HE SHRIEKED THINK
OF MY FATHER OF MY MOTHER IT WOULD BREAK THEIR HEARTS I NEVER WENT
WRONG BEFORE I NEVER WILL AGAIN I SWEAR IT ILL SWEAR IT ON A
BIBLE OH DONT BRING IT INTO COURT FOR CHRISTS SAKE DONT
GET BACK INTO YOUR CHAIR SAID HOLMES STERNLY IT IS VERY WELL TO
CRINGE AND CRAWL NOW BUT YOU THOUGHT LITTLE ENOUGH OF THIS POOR
HORNER IN THE DOCK FOR A CRIME OF WHICH HE KNEW NOTHING
I WILL FLY MR HOLMES I WILL LEAVE THE COUNTRY SIR THEN THE
CHARGE AGAINST HIM WILL BREAK DOWN
HUM WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT AND NOW LET US HEAR A TRUE ACCOUNT OF
THE NEXT ACT HOW CAME THE STONE INTO THE GOOSE AND HOW CAME THE
GOOSE INTO THE OPEN MARKET TELL US THE TRUTH FOR THERE LIES YOUR
ONLY HOPE OF SAFETY
RYDER PASSED HIS TONGUE OVER HIS PARCHED LIPS I WILL TELL YOU IT
JUST AS IT HAPPENED SIR SAID HE WHEN HORNER HAD BEEN ARRESTED
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IT WOULD BE BEST FOR ME TO GET AWAY WITH THE
STONE AT ONCE FOR I DID NOT KNOW AT WHAT MOMENT THE POLICE MIGHT NOT
TAKE IT INTO THEIR HEADS TO SEARCH ME AND MY ROOM THERE WAS NO PLACE
ABOUT THE HOTEL WHERE IT WOULD BE SAFE I WENT OUT AS IF ON SOME
COMMISSION AND I MADE FOR MY SISTERS HOUSE SHE HAD MARRIED A MAN
NAMED OAKSHOTT AND LIVED IN BRIXTON ROAD WHERE SHE FATTENED FOWLS
FOR THE MARKET ALL THE WAY THERE EVERY MAN I MET SEEMED TO ME TO BE
A POLICEMAN OR A DETECTIVE AND FOR ALL THAT IT WAS A COLD NIGHT
THE SWEAT WAS POURING DOWN MY FACE BEFORE I CAME TO THE BRIXTON ROAD
MY SISTER ASKED ME WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND WHY I WAS SO PALE BUT I
TOLD HER THAT I HAD BEEN UPSET BY THE JEWEL ROBBERY AT THE HOTEL
THEN I WENT INTO THE BACK YARD AND SMOKED A PIPE AND WONDERED WHAT IT
WOULD BE BEST TO DO
I HAD A FRIEND ONCE CALLED MAUDSLEY WHO WENT TO THE BAD AND HAS
JUST BEEN SERVING HIS TIME IN PENTONVILLE ONE DAY HE HAD MET ME AND
FELL INTO TALK ABOUT THE WAYS OF THIEVES AND HOW THEY COULD GET RID
OF WHAT THEY STOLE I KNEW THAT HE WOULD BE TRUE TO ME FOR I KNEW
ONE OR TWO THINGS ABOUT HIM SO I MADE UP MY MIND TO GO RIGHT ON TO
KILBURN WHERE HE LIVED AND TAKE HIM INTO MY CONFIDENCE HE WOULD
SHOW ME HOW TO TURN THE STONE INTO MONEY BUT HOW TO GET TO HIM IN
SAFETY I THOUGHT OF THE AGONIES I HAD GONE THROUGH IN COMING FROM
THE HOTEL I MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT BE SEIZED AND SEARCHED AND THERE
WOULD BE THE STONE IN MY WAISTCOAT POCKET I WAS LEANING AGAINST THE
WALL AT THE TIME AND LOOKING AT THE GEESE WHICH WERE WADDLING ABOUT
ROUND MY FEET AND SUDDENLY AN IDEA CAME INTO MY HEAD WHICH SHOWED ME
HOW I COULD BEAT THE BEST DETECTIVE THAT EVER LIVED
MY SISTER HAD TOLD ME SOME WEEKS BEFORE THAT I MIGHT HAVE THE PICK
OF HER GEESE FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND I KNEW THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS
AS GOOD AS HER WORD I WOULD TAKE MY GOOSE NOW AND IN IT I WOULD
CARRY MY STONE TO KILBURN THERE WAS A LITTLE SHED IN THE YARD AND
BEHIND THIS I DROVE ONE OF THE BIRDSA FINE BIG ONE WHITE WITH A
BARRED TAIL I CAUGHT IT AND PRYING ITS BILL OPEN I THRUST THE
STONE DOWN ITS THROAT AS FAR AS MY FINGER COULD REACH THE BIRD GAVE
A GULP AND I FELT THE STONE PASS ALONG ITS GULLET AND DOWN INTO ITS
CROP BUT THE CREATURE FLAPPED AND STRUGGLED AND OUT CAME MY SISTER
TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER AS I TURNED TO SPEAK TO HER THE BRUTE
BROKE LOOSE AND FLUTTERED OFF AMONG THE OTHERS
WHATEVER WERE YOU DOING WITH THAT BIRD JEM SAYS SHE
WELL SAID I YOU SAID YOUD GIVE ME ONE FOR CHRISTMAS AND I WAS
FEELING WHICH WAS THE FATTEST
OH SAYS SHE WEVE SET YOURS ASIDE FOR YOUJEMS BIRD WE CALL
IT ITS THE BIG WHITE ONE OVER YONDER THERES TWENTYSIX OF THEM
WHICH MAKES ONE FOR YOU AND ONE FOR US AND TWO DOZEN FOR THE
MARKET
THANK YOU MAGGIE SAYS I BUT IF IT IS ALL THE SAME TO YOU ID
RATHER HAVE THAT ONE I WAS HANDLING JUST NOW
THE OTHER IS A GOOD THREE POUND HEAVIER SAID SHE AND WE
FATTENED IT EXPRESSLY FOR YOU
NEVER MIND ILL HAVE THE OTHER AND ILL TAKE IT NOW SAID I
OH JUST AS YOU LIKE SAID SHE A LITTLE HUFFED WHICH IS IT YOU
WANT THEN
THAT WHITE ONE WITH THE BARRED TAIL RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
FLOCK
OH VERY WELL KILL IT AND TAKE IT WITH YOU
WELL I DID WHAT SHE SAID MR HOLMES AND I CARRIED THE BIRD ALL
THE WAY TO KILBURN I TOLD MY PAL WHAT I HAD DONE FOR HE WAS A MAN
THAT IT WAS EASY TO TELL A THING LIKE THAT TO HE LAUGHED UNTIL HE
CHOKED AND WE GOT A KNIFE AND OPENED THE GOOSE MY HEART TURNED TO
WATER FOR THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE STONE AND I KNEW THAT SOME
TERRIBLE MISTAKE HAD OCCURRED I LEFT THE BIRD RUSHED BACK TO MY
SISTERS AND HURRIED INTO THE BACK YARD THERE WAS NOT A BIRD TO BE
SEEN THERE
WHERE ARE THEY ALL MAGGIE I CRIED
GONE TO THE DEALERS JEM
WHICH DEALERS
BRECKINRIDGE OF COVENT GARDEN
BUT WAS THERE ANOTHER WITH A BARRED TAIL I ASKED THE SAME AS
THE ONE I CHOSE
YES JEM THERE WERE TWO BARREDTAILED ONES AND I COULD NEVER TELL
THEM APART
WELL THEN OF COURSE I SAW IT ALL AND I RAN OFF AS HARD AS MY FEET
WOULD CARRY ME TO THIS MAN BRECKINRIDGE BUT HE HAD SOLD THE LOT AT
ONCE AND NOT ONE WORD WOULD HE TELL ME AS TO WHERE THEY HAD GONE
YOU HEARD HIM YOURSELVES TONIGHT WELL HE HAS ALWAYS ANSWERED ME
LIKE THAT MY SISTER THINKS THAT I AM GOING MAD SOMETIMES I THINK
THAT I AM MYSELF AND NOWAND NOW I AM MYSELF A BRANDED THIEF
WITHOUT EVER HAVING TOUCHED THE WEALTH FOR WHICH I SOLD MY CHARACTER
GOD HELP ME GOD HELP ME HE BURST INTO CONVULSIVE SOBBING WITH HIS
FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS
THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY HIS HEAVY BREATHING AND BY
THE MEASURED TAPPING OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FINGERTIPS UPON THE EDGE OF
THE TABLE THEN MY FRIEND ROSE AND THREW OPEN THE DOOR
GET OUT SAID HE
WHAT SIR OH HEAVEN BLESS YOU
NO MORE WORDS GET OUT
AND NO MORE WORDS WERE NEEDED THERE WAS A RUSH A CLATTER UPON THE
STAIRS THE BANG OF A DOOR AND THE CRISP RATTLE OF RUNNING FOOTFALLS
FROM THE STREET
AFTER ALL WATSON SAID HOLMES REACHING UP HIS HAND FOR HIS CLAY
PIPE I AM NOT RETAINED BY THE POLICE TO SUPPLY THEIR DEFICIENCIES
IF HORNER WERE IN DANGER IT WOULD BE ANOTHER THING BUT THIS FELLOW
WILL NOT APPEAR AGAINST HIM AND THE CASE MUST COLLAPSE I SUPPOSE
THAT I AM COMMUTING A FELONY BUT IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT I AM
SAVING A SOUL THIS FELLOW WILL NOT GO WRONG AGAIN HE IS TOO
TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED SEND HIM TO JAIL NOW AND YOU MAKE HIM A
JAILBIRD FOR LIFE BESIDES IT IS THE SEASON OF FORGIVENESS CHANCE
HAS PUT IN OUR WAY A MOST SINGULAR AND WHIMSICAL PROBLEM AND ITS
SOLUTION IS ITS OWN REWARD IF YOU WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO TOUCH
THE BELL DOCTOR WE WILL BEGIN ANOTHER INVESTIGATION IN WHICH ALSO
A BIRD WILL BE THE CHIEF FEATURE
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
ON GLANCING OVER MY NOTES OF THE SEVENTY ODD CASES IN WHICH I HAVE
DURING THE LAST EIGHT YEARS STUDIED THE METHODS OF MY FRIEND SHERLOCK
HOLMES I FIND MANY TRAGIC SOME COMIC A LARGE NUMBER MERELY
STRANGE BUT NONE COMMONPLACE FOR WORKING AS HE DID RATHER FOR THE
LOVE OF HIS ART THAN FOR THE ACQUIREMENT OF WEALTH HE REFUSED TO
ASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH ANY INVESTIGATION WHICH DID NOT TEND TOWARDS
THE UNUSUAL AND EVEN THE FANTASTIC OF ALL THESE VARIED CASES
HOWEVER I CANNOT RECALL ANY WHICH PRESENTED MORE SINGULAR FEATURES
THAN THAT WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WELLKNOWN SURREY FAMILY OF
THE ROYLOTTS OF STOKE MORAN THE EVENTS IN QUESTION OCCURRED IN THE
EARLY DAYS OF MY ASSOCIATION WITH HOLMES WHEN WE WERE SHARING ROOMS
AS BACHELORS IN BAKER STREET IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT HAVE PLACED
THEM UPON RECORD BEFORE BUT A PROMISE OF SECRECY WAS MADE AT THE
TIME FROM WHICH I HAVE ONLY BEEN FREED DURING THE LAST MONTH BY THE
UNTIMELY DEATH OF THE LADY TO WHOM THE PLEDGE WAS GIVEN IT IS
PERHAPS AS WELL THAT THE FACTS SHOULD NOW COME TO LIGHT FOR I HAVE
REASONS TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE WIDESPREAD RUMOURS AS TO THE DEATH OF
DR GRIMESBY ROYLOTT WHICH TEND TO MAKE THE MATTER EVEN MORE TERRIBLE
THAN THE TRUTH
IT WAS EARLY IN APRIL IN THE YEAR THAT I WOKE ONE MORNING TO FIND
SHERLOCK HOLMES STANDING FULLY DRESSED BY THE SIDE OF MY BED HE
WAS A LATE RISER AS A RULE AND AS THE CLOCK ON THE MANTELPIECE
SHOWED ME THAT IT WAS ONLY A QUARTERPAST SEVEN I BLINKED UP AT HIM
IN SOME SURPRISE AND PERHAPS JUST A LITTLE RESENTMENT FOR I WAS
MYSELF REGULAR IN MY HABITS
VERY SORRY TO KNOCK YOU UP WATSON SAID HE BUT ITS THE COMMON
LOT THIS MORNING MRS HUDSON HAS BEEN KNOCKED UP SHE RETORTED UPON
ME AND I ON YOU
WHAT IS IT THENA FIRE
NO A CLIENT IT SEEMS THAT A YOUNG LADY HAS ARRIVED IN A
CONSIDERABLE STATE OF EXCITEMENT WHO INSISTS UPON SEEING ME SHE IS
WAITING NOW IN THE SITTINGROOM NOW WHEN YOUNG LADIES WANDER ABOUT
THE METROPOLIS AT THIS HOUR OF THE MORNING AND KNOCK SLEEPY PEOPLE
UP OUT OF THEIR BEDS I PRESUME THAT IT IS SOMETHING VERY PRESSING
WHICH THEY HAVE TO COMMUNICATE SHOULD IT PROVE TO BE AN INTERESTING
CASE YOU WOULD I AM SURE WISH TO FOLLOW IT FROM THE OUTSET I
THOUGHT AT ANY RATE THAT I SHOULD CALL YOU AND GIVE YOU THE
CHANCE
MY DEAR FELLOW I WOULD NOT MISS IT FOR ANYTHING
I HAD NO KEENER PLEASURE THAN IN FOLLOWING HOLMES IN HIS PROFESSIONAL
INVESTIGATIONS AND IN ADMIRING THE RAPID DEDUCTIONS AS SWIFT AS
INTUITIONS AND YET ALWAYS FOUNDED ON A LOGICAL BASIS WITH WHICH HE
UNRAVELLED THE PROBLEMS WHICH WERE SUBMITTED TO HIM I RAPIDLY THREW
ON MY CLOTHES AND WAS READY IN A FEW MINUTES TO ACCOMPANY MY FRIEND
DOWN TO THE SITTINGROOM A LADY DRESSED IN BLACK AND HEAVILY VEILED
WHO HAD BEEN SITTING IN THE WINDOW ROSE AS WE ENTERED
GOODMORNING MADAM SAID HOLMES CHEERILY MY NAME IS SHERLOCK
HOLMES THIS IS MY INTIMATE FRIEND AND ASSOCIATE DR WATSON BEFORE
WHOM YOU CAN SPEAK AS FREELY AS BEFORE MYSELF HA I AM GLAD TO SEE
THAT MRS HUDSON HAS HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO LIGHT THE FIRE PRAY DRAW
UP TO IT AND I SHALL ORDER YOU A CUP OF HOT COFFEE FOR I OBSERVE
THAT YOU ARE SHIVERING
IT IS NOT COLD WHICH MAKES ME SHIVER SAID THE WOMAN IN A LOW
VOICE CHANGING HER SEAT AS REQUESTED
WHAT THEN
IT IS FEAR MR HOLMES IT IS TERROR SHE RAISED HER VEIL AS SHE
SPOKE AND WE COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS INDEED IN A PITIABLE STATE OF
AGITATION HER FACE ALL DRAWN AND GREY WITH RESTLESS FRIGHTENED
EYES LIKE THOSE OF SOME HUNTED ANIMAL HER FEATURES AND FIGURE WERE
THOSE OF A WOMAN OF THIRTY BUT HER HAIR WAS SHOT WITH PREMATURE
GREY AND HER EXPRESSION WAS WEARY AND HAGGARD SHERLOCK HOLMES RAN
HER OVER WITH ONE OF HIS QUICK ALLCOMPREHENSIVE GLANCES
YOU MUST NOT FEAR SAID HE SOOTHINGLY BENDING FORWARD AND PATTING
HER FOREARM WE SHALL SOON SET MATTERS RIGHT I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU
HAVE COME IN BY TRAIN THIS MORNING I SEE
YOU KNOW ME THEN
NO BUT I OBSERVE THE SECOND HALF OF A RETURN TICKET IN THE PALM OF
YOUR LEFT GLOVE YOU MUST HAVE STARTED EARLY AND YET YOU HAD A GOOD
DRIVE IN A DOGCART ALONG HEAVY ROADS BEFORE YOU REACHED THE
STATION
THE LADY GAVE A VIOLENT START AND STARED IN BEWILDERMENT AT MY
COMPANION
THERE IS NO MYSTERY MY DEAR MADAM SAID HE SMILING THE LEFT ARM
OF YOUR JACKET IS SPATTERED WITH MUD IN NO LESS THAN SEVEN PLACES
THE MARKS ARE PERFECTLY FRESH THERE IS NO VEHICLE SAVE A DOGCART
WHICH THROWS UP MUD IN THAT WAY AND THEN ONLY WHEN YOU SIT ON THE
LEFTHAND SIDE OF THE DRIVER
WHATEVER YOUR REASONS MAY BE YOU ARE PERFECTLY CORRECT SAID SHE
I STARTED FROM HOME BEFORE SIX REACHED LEATHERHEAD AT TWENTY PAST
AND CAME IN BY THE FIRST TRAIN TO WATERLOO SIR I CAN STAND THIS
STRAIN NO LONGER I SHALL GO MAD IF IT CONTINUES I HAVE NO ONE TO
TURN TONONE SAVE ONLY ONE WHO CARES FOR ME AND HE POOR FELLOW
CAN BE OF LITTLE AID I HAVE HEARD OF YOU MR HOLMES I HAVE HEARD
OF YOU FROM MRS FARINTOSH WHOM YOU HELPED IN THE HOUR OF HER SORE
NEED IT WAS FROM HER THAT I HAD YOUR ADDRESS OH SIR DO YOU NOT
THINK THAT YOU COULD HELP ME TOO AND AT LEAST THROW A LITTLE LIGHT
THROUGH THE DENSE DARKNESS WHICH SURROUNDS ME AT PRESENT IT IS OUT
OF MY POWER TO REWARD YOU FOR YOUR SERVICES BUT IN A MONTH OR SIX
WEEKS I SHALL BE MARRIED WITH THE CONTROL OF MY OWN INCOME AND THEN
AT LEAST YOU SHALL NOT FIND ME UNGRATEFUL
HOLMES TURNED TO HIS DESK AND UNLOCKING IT DREW OUT A SMALL
CASEBOOK WHICH HE CONSULTED
FARINTOSH SAID HE AH YES I RECALL THE CASE IT WAS CONCERNED
WITH AN OPAL TIARA I THINK IT WAS BEFORE YOUR TIME WATSON I CAN
ONLY SAY MADAM THAT I SHALL BE HAPPY TO DEVOTE THE SAME CARE TO
YOUR CASE AS I DID TO THAT OF YOUR FRIEND AS TO REWARD MY
PROFESSION IS ITS OWN REWARD BUT YOU ARE AT LIBERTY TO DEFRAY
WHATEVER EXPENSES I MAY BE PUT TO AT THE TIME WHICH SUITS YOU BEST
AND NOW I BEG THAT YOU WILL LAY BEFORE US EVERYTHING THAT MAY HELP US
IN FORMING AN OPINION UPON THE MATTER
ALAS REPLIED OUR VISITOR THE VERY HORROR OF MY SITUATION LIES IN
THE FACT THAT MY FEARS ARE SO VAGUE AND MY SUSPICIONS DEPEND SO
ENTIRELY UPON SMALL POINTS WHICH MIGHT SEEM TRIVIAL TO ANOTHER THAT
EVEN HE TO WHOM OF ALL OTHERS I HAVE A RIGHT TO LOOK FOR HELP AND
ADVICE LOOKS UPON ALL THAT I TELL HIM ABOUT IT AS THE FANCIES OF A
NERVOUS WOMAN HE DOES NOT SAY SO BUT I CAN READ IT FROM HIS
SOOTHING ANSWERS AND AVERTED EYES BUT I HAVE HEARD MR HOLMES THAT
YOU CAN SEE DEEPLY INTO THE MANIFOLD WICKEDNESS OF THE HUMAN HEART
YOU MAY ADVISE ME HOW TO WALK AMID THE DANGERS WHICH ENCOMPASS ME
I AM ALL ATTENTION MADAM
MY NAME IS HELEN STONER AND I AM LIVING WITH MY STEPFATHER WHO IS
THE LAST SURVIVOR OF ONE OF THE OLDEST SAXON FAMILIES IN ENGLAND THE
ROYLOTTS OF STOKE MORAN ON THE WESTERN BORDER OF SURREY
HOLMES NODDED HIS HEAD THE NAME IS FAMILIAR TO ME SAID HE
THE FAMILY WAS AT ONE TIME AMONG THE RICHEST IN ENGLAND AND THE
ESTATES EXTENDED OVER THE BORDERS INTO BERKSHIRE IN THE NORTH AND
HAMPSHIRE IN THE WEST IN THE LAST CENTURY HOWEVER FOUR SUCCESSIVE
HEIRS WERE OF A DISSOLUTE AND WASTEFUL DISPOSITION AND THE FAMILY
RUIN WAS EVENTUALLY COMPLETED BY A GAMBLER IN THE DAYS OF THE
REGENCY NOTHING WAS LEFT SAVE A FEW ACRES OF GROUND AND THE
TWOHUNDREDYEAROLD HOUSE WHICH IS ITSELF CRUSHED UNDER A HEAVY
MORTGAGE THE LAST SQUIRE DRAGGED OUT HIS EXISTENCE THERE LIVING THE
HORRIBLE LIFE OF AN ARISTOCRATIC PAUPER BUT HIS ONLY SON MY
STEPFATHER SEEING THAT HE MUST ADAPT HIMSELF TO THE NEW CONDITIONS
OBTAINED AN ADVANCE FROM A RELATIVE WHICH ENABLED HIM TO TAKE A
MEDICAL DEGREE AND WENT OUT TO CALCUTTA WHERE BY HIS PROFESSIONAL
SKILL AND HIS FORCE OF CHARACTER HE ESTABLISHED A LARGE PRACTICE IN
A FIT OF ANGER HOWEVER CAUSED BY SOME ROBBERIES WHICH HAD BEEN
PERPETRATED IN THE HOUSE HE BEAT HIS NATIVE BUTLER TO DEATH AND
NARROWLY ESCAPED A CAPITAL SENTENCE AS IT WAS HE SUFFERED A LONG
TERM OF IMPRISONMENT AND AFTERWARDS RETURNED TO ENGLAND A MOROSE AND
DISAPPOINTED MAN
WHEN DR ROYLOTT WAS IN INDIA HE MARRIED MY MOTHER MRS STONER THE
YOUNG WIDOW OF MAJORGENERAL STONER OF THE BENGAL ARTILLERY MY
SISTER JULIA AND I WERE TWINS AND WE WERE ONLY TWO YEARS OLD AT THE
TIME OF MY MOTHERS REMARRIAGE SHE HAD A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF
MONEYNOT LESS THAN A YEARAND THIS SHE BEQUEATHED TO DR
ROYLOTT ENTIRELY WHILE WE RESIDED WITH HIM WITH A PROVISION THAT A
CERTAIN ANNUAL SUM SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO EACH OF US IN THE EVENT OF
OUR MARRIAGE SHORTLY AFTER OUR RETURN TO ENGLAND MY MOTHER DIEDSHE
WAS KILLED EIGHT YEARS AGO IN A RAILWAY ACCIDENT NEAR CREWE DR
ROYLOTT THEN ABANDONED HIS ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF IN PRACTICE
IN LONDON AND TOOK US TO LIVE WITH HIM IN THE OLD ANCESTRAL HOUSE AT
STOKE MORAN THE MONEY WHICH MY MOTHER HAD LEFT WAS ENOUGH FOR ALL
OUR WANTS AND THERE SEEMED TO BE NO OBSTACLE TO OUR HAPPINESS
BUT A TERRIBLE CHANGE CAME OVER OUR STEPFATHER ABOUT THIS TIME
INSTEAD OF MAKING FRIENDS AND EXCHANGING VISITS WITH OUR NEIGHBOURS
WHO HAD AT FIRST BEEN OVERJOYED TO SEE A ROYLOTT OF STOKE MORAN BACK
IN THE OLD FAMILY SEAT HE SHUT HIMSELF UP IN HIS HOUSE AND SELDOM
CAME OUT SAVE TO INDULGE IN FEROCIOUS QUARRELS WITH WHOEVER MIGHT
CROSS HIS PATH VIOLENCE OF TEMPER APPROACHING TO MANIA HAS BEEN
HEREDITARY IN THE MEN OF THE FAMILY AND IN MY STEPFATHERS CASE IT
HAD I BELIEVE BEEN INTENSIFIED BY HIS LONG RESIDENCE IN THE
TROPICS A SERIES OF DISGRACEFUL BRAWLS TOOK PLACE TWO OF WHICH
ENDED IN THE POLICECOURT UNTIL AT LAST HE BECAME THE TERROR OF THE
VILLAGE AND THE FOLKS WOULD FLY AT HIS APPROACH FOR HE IS A MAN OF
IMMENSE STRENGTH AND ABSOLUTELY UNCONTROLLABLE IN HIS ANGER
LAST WEEK HE HURLED THE LOCAL BLACKSMITH OVER A PARAPET INTO A
STREAM AND IT WAS ONLY BY PAYING OVER ALL THE MONEY WHICH I COULD
GATHER TOGETHER THAT I WAS ABLE TO AVERT ANOTHER PUBLIC EXPOSURE HE
HAD NO FRIENDS AT ALL SAVE THE WANDERING GYPSIES AND HE WOULD GIVE
THESE VAGABONDS LEAVE TO ENCAMP UPON THE FEW ACRES OF BRAMBLECOVERED
LAND WHICH REPRESENT THE FAMILY ESTATE AND WOULD ACCEPT IN RETURN
THE HOSPITALITY OF THEIR TENTS WANDERING AWAY WITH THEM SOMETIMES
FOR WEEKS ON END HE HAS A PASSION ALSO FOR INDIAN ANIMALS WHICH ARE
SENT OVER TO HIM BY A CORRESPONDENT AND HE HAS AT THIS MOMENT A
CHEETAH AND A BABOON WHICH WANDER FREELY OVER HIS GROUNDS AND ARE
FEARED BY THE VILLAGERS ALMOST AS MUCH AS THEIR MASTER
YOU CAN IMAGINE FROM WHAT I SAY THAT MY POOR SISTER JULIA AND I HAD
NO GREAT PLEASURE IN OUR LIVES NO SERVANT WOULD STAY WITH US AND
FOR A LONG TIME WE DID ALL THE WORK OF THE HOUSE SHE WAS BUT THIRTY
AT THE TIME OF HER DEATH AND YET HER HAIR HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO
WHITEN EVEN AS MINE HAS
YOUR SISTER IS DEAD THEN
SHE DIED JUST TWO YEARS AGO AND IT IS OF HER DEATH THAT I WISH TO
SPEAK TO YOU YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT LIVING THE LIFE WHICH I HAVE
DESCRIBED WE WERE LITTLE LIKELY TO SEE ANYONE OF OUR OWN AGE AND
POSITION WE HAD HOWEVER AN AUNT MY MOTHERS MAIDEN SISTER MISS
HONORIA WESTPHAIL WHO LIVES NEAR HARROW AND WE WERE OCCASIONALLY
ALLOWED TO PAY SHORT VISITS AT THIS LADYS HOUSE JULIA WENT THERE AT
CHRISTMAS TWO YEARS AGO AND MET THERE A HALFPAY MAJOR OF MARINES
TO WHOM SHE BECAME ENGAGED MY STEPFATHER LEARNED OF THE ENGAGEMENT
WHEN MY SISTER RETURNED AND OFFERED NO OBJECTION TO THE MARRIAGE BUT
WITHIN A FORTNIGHT OF THE DAY WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED FOR THE WEDDING
THE TERRIBLE EVENT OCCURRED WHICH HAS DEPRIVED ME OF MY ONLY
COMPANION
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD BEEN LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH HIS EYES
CLOSED AND HIS HEAD SUNK IN A CUSHION BUT HE HALF OPENED HIS LIDS
NOW AND GLANCED ACROSS AT HIS VISITOR
PRAY BE PRECISE AS TO DETAILS SAID HE
IT IS EASY FOR ME TO BE SO FOR EVERY EVENT OF THAT DREADFUL TIME IS
SEARED INTO MY MEMORY THE MANORHOUSE IS AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID
VERY OLD AND ONLY ONE WING IS NOW INHABITED THE BEDROOMS IN THIS
WING ARE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE SITTINGROOMS BEING IN THE CENTRAL
BLOCK OF THE BUILDINGS OF THESE BEDROOMS THE FIRST IS DR ROYLOTTS
THE SECOND MY SISTERS AND THE THIRD MY OWN THERE IS NO
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM BUT THEY ALL OPEN OUT INTO THE SAME
CORRIDOR DO I MAKE MYSELF PLAIN
PERFECTLY SO
THE WINDOWS OF THE THREE ROOMS OPEN OUT UPON THE LAWN THAT FATAL
NIGHT DR ROYLOTT HAD GONE TO HIS ROOM EARLY THOUGH WE KNEW THAT HE
HAD NOT RETIRED TO REST FOR MY SISTER WAS TROUBLED BY THE SMELL OF
THE STRONG INDIAN CIGARS WHICH IT WAS HIS CUSTOM TO SMOKE SHE LEFT
HER ROOM THEREFORE AND CAME INTO MINE WHERE SHE SAT FOR SOME TIME
CHATTING ABOUT HER APPROACHING WEDDING AT ELEVEN OCLOCK SHE ROSE TO
LEAVE ME BUT SHE PAUSED AT THE DOOR AND LOOKED BACK
TELL ME HELEN SAID SHE HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ANYONE WHISTLE IN
THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT
NEVER SAID I
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU COULD NOT POSSIBLY WHISTLE YOURSELF IN YOUR
SLEEP
CERTAINLY NOT BUT WHY
BECAUSE DURING THE LAST FEW NIGHTS I HAVE ALWAYS ABOUT THREE IN
THE MORNING HEARD A LOW CLEAR WHISTLE I AM A LIGHT SLEEPER AND IT
HAS AWAKENED ME I CANNOT TELL WHERE IT CAME FROMPERHAPS FROM THE
NEXT ROOM PERHAPS FROM THE LAWN I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD JUST ASK YOU
WHETHER YOU HAD HEARD IT
NO I HAVE NOT IT MUST BE THOSE WRETCHED GIPSIES IN THE
PLANTATION
VERY LIKELY AND YET IF IT WERE ON THE LAWN I WONDER THAT YOU DID
NOT HEAR IT ALSO
AH BUT I SLEEP MORE HEAVILY THAN YOU
WELL IT IS OF NO GREAT CONSEQUENCE AT ANY RATE SHE SMILED BACK
AT ME CLOSED MY DOOR AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER I HEARD HER KEY TURN
IN THE LOCK
INDEED SAID HOLMES WAS IT YOUR CUSTOM ALWAYS TO LOCK YOURSELVES
IN AT NIGHT
ALWAYS
AND WHY
I THINK THAT I MENTIONED TO YOU THAT THE DOCTOR KEPT A CHEETAH AND A
BABOON WE HAD NO FEELING OF SECURITY UNLESS OUR DOORS WERE LOCKED
QUITE SO PRAY PROCEED WITH YOUR STATEMENT
I COULD NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT A VAGUE FEELING OF IMPENDING
MISFORTUNE IMPRESSED ME MY SISTER AND I YOU WILL RECOLLECT WERE
TWINS AND YOU KNOW HOW SUBTLE ARE THE LINKS WHICH BIND TWO SOULS
WHICH ARE SO CLOSELY ALLIED IT WAS A WILD NIGHT THE WIND WAS
HOWLING OUTSIDE AND THE RAIN WAS BEATING AND SPLASHING AGAINST THE
WINDOWS SUDDENLY AMID ALL THE HUBBUB OF THE GALE THERE BURST FORTH
THE WILD SCREAM OF A TERRIFIED WOMAN I KNEW THAT IT WAS MY SISTERS
VOICE I SPRANG FROM MY BED WRAPPED A SHAWL ROUND ME AND RUSHED
INTO THE CORRIDOR AS I OPENED MY DOOR I SEEMED TO HEAR A LOW
WHISTLE SUCH AS MY SISTER DESCRIBED AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER A
CLANGING SOUND AS IF A MASS OF METAL HAD FALLEN AS I RAN DOWN THE
PASSAGE MY SISTERS DOOR WAS UNLOCKED AND REVOLVED SLOWLY UPON ITS
HINGES I STARED AT IT HORRORSTRICKEN NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS ABOUT TO
ISSUE FROM IT BY THE LIGHT OF THE CORRIDORLAMP I SAW MY SISTER
APPEAR AT THE OPENING HER FACE BLANCHED WITH TERROR HER HANDS
GROPING FOR HELP HER WHOLE FIGURE SWAYING TO AND FRO LIKE THAT OF A
DRUNKARD I RAN TO HER AND THREW MY ARMS ROUND HER BUT AT THAT
MOMENT HER KNEES SEEMED TO GIVE WAY AND SHE FELL TO THE GROUND SHE
WRITHED AS ONE WHO IS IN TERRIBLE PAIN AND HER LIMBS WERE DREADFULLY
CONVULSED AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD NOT RECOGNISED ME BUT AS
I BENT OVER HER SHE SUDDENLY SHRIEKED OUT IN A VOICE WHICH I SHALL
NEVER FORGET OH MY GOD HELEN IT WAS THE BAND THE SPECKLED
BAND THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE WHICH SHE WOULD FAIN HAVE SAID AND
SHE STABBED WITH HER FINGER INTO THE AIR IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
DOCTORS ROOM BUT A FRESH CONVULSION SEIZED HER AND CHOKED HER
WORDS I RUSHED OUT CALLING LOUDLY FOR MY STEPFATHER AND I MET HIM
HASTENING FROM HIS ROOM IN HIS DRESSINGGOWN WHEN HE REACHED MY
SISTERS SIDE SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND THOUGH HE POURED BRANDY DOWN
HER THROAT AND SENT FOR MEDICAL AID FROM THE VILLAGE ALL EFFORTS
WERE IN VAIN FOR SHE SLOWLY SANK AND DIED WITHOUT HAVING RECOVERED
HER CONSCIOUSNESS SUCH WAS THE DREADFUL END OF MY BELOVED SISTER
ONE MOMENT SAID HOLMES ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS WHISTLE AND
METALLIC SOUND COULD YOU SWEAR TO IT
THAT WAS WHAT THE COUNTY CORONER ASKED ME AT THE INQUIRY IT IS MY
STRONG IMPRESSION THAT I HEARD IT AND YET AMONG THE CRASH OF THE
GALE AND THE CREAKING OF AN OLD HOUSE I MAY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN
DECEIVED
WAS YOUR SISTER DRESSED
NO SHE WAS IN HER NIGHTDRESS IN HER RIGHT HAND WAS FOUND THE
CHARRED STUMP OF A MATCH AND IN HER LEFT A MATCHBOX
SHOWING THAT SHE HAD STRUCK A LIGHT AND LOOKED ABOUT HER WHEN THE
ALARM TOOK PLACE THAT IS IMPORTANT AND WHAT CONCLUSIONS DID THE
CORONER COME TO
HE INVESTIGATED THE CASE WITH GREAT CARE FOR DR ROYLOTTS CONDUCT
HAD LONG BEEN NOTORIOUS IN THE COUNTY BUT HE WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANY
SATISFACTORY CAUSE OF DEATH MY EVIDENCE SHOWED THAT THE DOOR HAD
BEEN FASTENED UPON THE INNER SIDE AND THE WINDOWS WERE BLOCKED BY
OLDFASHIONED SHUTTERS WITH BROAD IRON BARS WHICH WERE SECURED EVERY
NIGHT THE WALLS WERE CAREFULLY SOUNDED AND WERE SHOWN TO BE QUITE
SOLID ALL ROUND AND THE FLOORING WAS ALSO THOROUGHLY EXAMINED WITH
THE SAME RESULT THE CHIMNEY IS WIDE BUT IS BARRED UP BY FOUR LARGE
STAPLES IT IS CERTAIN THEREFORE THAT MY SISTER WAS QUITE ALONE
WHEN SHE MET HER END BESIDES THERE WERE NO MARKS OF ANY VIOLENCE
UPON HER
HOW ABOUT POISON
THE DOCTORS EXAMINED HER FOR IT BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THIS UNFORTUNATE LADY DIED OF THEN
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT SHE DIED OF PURE FEAR AND NERVOUS SHOCK THOUGH
WHAT IT WAS THAT FRIGHTENED HER I CANNOT IMAGINE
WERE THERE GIPSIES IN THE PLANTATION AT THE TIME
YES THERE ARE NEARLY ALWAYS SOME THERE
AH AND WHAT DID YOU GATHER FROM THIS ALLUSION TO A BANDA SPECKLED
BAND
SOMETIMES I HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS MERELY THE WILD TALK OF
DELIRIUM SOMETIMES THAT IT MAY HAVE REFERRED TO SOME BAND OF PEOPLE
PERHAPS TO THESE VERY GIPSIES IN THE PLANTATION I DO NOT KNOW
WHETHER THE SPOTTED HANDKERCHIEFS WHICH SO MANY OF THEM WEAR OVER
THEIR HEADS MIGHT HAVE SUGGESTED THE STRANGE ADJECTIVE WHICH SHE
USED
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD LIKE A MAN WHO IS FAR FROM BEING SATISFIED
THESE ARE VERY DEEP WATERS SAID HE PRAY GO ON WITH YOUR
NARRATIVE
TWO YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN AND MY LIFE HAS BEEN UNTIL LATELY
LONELIER THAN EVER A MONTH AGO HOWEVER A DEAR FRIEND WHOM I HAVE
KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ASK MY HAND IN
MARRIAGE HIS NAME IS ARMITAGEPERCY ARMITAGETHE SECOND SON OF MR
ARMITAGE OF CRANE WATER NEAR READING MY STEPFATHER HAS OFFERED NO
OPPOSITION TO THE MATCH AND WE ARE TO BE MARRIED IN THE COURSE OF
THE SPRING TWO DAYS AGO SOME REPAIRS WERE STARTED IN THE WEST WING
OF THE BUILDING AND MY BEDROOM WALL HAS BEEN PIERCED SO THAT I HAVE
HAD TO MOVE INTO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH MY SISTER DIED AND TO SLEEP IN
THE VERY BED IN WHICH SHE SLEPT IMAGINE THEN MY THRILL OF TERROR
WHEN LAST NIGHT AS I LAY AWAKE THINKING OVER HER TERRIBLE FATE I
SUDDENLY HEARD IN THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT THE LOW WHISTLE WHICH HAD
BEEN THE HERALD OF HER OWN DEATH I SPRANG UP AND LIT THE LAMP BUT
NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE ROOM I WAS TOO SHAKEN TO GO TO BED
AGAIN HOWEVER SO I DRESSED AND AS SOON AS IT WAS DAYLIGHT I
SLIPPED DOWN GOT A DOGCART AT THE CROWN INN WHICH IS OPPOSITE AND
DROVE TO LEATHERHEAD FROM WHENCE I HAVE COME ON THIS MORNING WITH
THE ONE OBJECT OF SEEING YOU AND ASKING YOUR ADVICE
YOU HAVE DONE WISELY SAID MY FRIEND BUT HAVE YOU TOLD ME ALL
YES ALL
MISS ROYLOTT YOU HAVE NOT YOU ARE SCREENING YOUR STEPFATHER
WHY WHAT DO YOU MEAN
FOR ANSWER HOLMES PUSHED BACK THE FRILL OF BLACK LACE WHICH FRINGED
THE HAND THAT LAY UPON OUR VISITORS KNEE FIVE LITTLE LIVID SPOTS
THE MARKS OF FOUR FINGERS AND A THUMB WERE PRINTED UPON THE WHITE
WRIST
YOU HAVE BEEN CRUELLY USED SAID HOLMES
THE LADY COLOURED DEEPLY AND COVERED OVER HER INJURED WRIST HE IS A
HARD MAN SHE SAID AND PERHAPS HE HARDLY KNOWS HIS OWN STRENGTH
THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE DURING WHICH HOLMES LEANED HIS CHIN UPON
HIS HANDS AND STARED INTO THE CRACKLING FIRE
THIS IS A VERY DEEP BUSINESS HE SAID AT LAST THERE ARE A
THOUSAND DETAILS WHICH I SHOULD DESIRE TO KNOW BEFORE I DECIDE UPON
OUR COURSE OF ACTION YET WE HAVE NOT A MOMENT TO LOSE IF WE WERE TO
COME TO STOKE MORAN TODAY WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR US TO SEE OVER
THESE ROOMS WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR STEPFATHER
AS IT HAPPENS HE SPOKE OF COMING INTO TOWN TODAY UPON SOME MOST
IMPORTANT BUSINESS IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE WILL BE AWAY ALL DAY AND
THAT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO DISTURB YOU WE HAVE A HOUSEKEEPER
NOW BUT SHE IS OLD AND FOOLISH AND I COULD EASILY GET HER OUT OF
THE WAY
EXCELLENT YOU ARE NOT AVERSE TO THIS TRIP WATSON
BY NO MEANS
THEN WE SHALL BOTH COME WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO YOURSELF
I HAVE ONE OR TWO THINGS WHICH I WOULD WISH TO DO NOW THAT I AM IN
TOWN BUT I SHALL RETURN BY THE TWELVE OCLOCK TRAIN SO AS TO BE
THERE IN TIME FOR YOUR COMING
AND YOU MAY EXPECT US EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON I HAVE MYSELF SOME
SMALL BUSINESS MATTERS TO ATTEND TO WILL YOU NOT WAIT AND
BREAKFAST
NO I MUST GO MY HEART IS LIGHTENED ALREADY SINCE I HAVE CONFIDED
MY TROUBLE TO YOU I SHALL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AGAIN THIS
AFTERNOON SHE DROPPED HER THICK BLACK VEIL OVER HER FACE AND GLIDED
FROM THE ROOM
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT ALL WATSON ASKED SHERLOCK HOLMES
LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR
IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A MOST DARK AND SINISTER BUSINESS
DARK ENOUGH AND SINISTER ENOUGH
YET IF THE LADY IS CORRECT IN SAYING THAT THE FLOORING AND WALLS ARE
SOUND AND THAT THE DOOR WINDOW AND CHIMNEY ARE IMPASSABLE THEN
HER SISTER MUST HAVE BEEN UNDOUBTEDLY ALONE WHEN SHE MET HER
MYSTERIOUS END
WHAT BECOMES THEN OF THESE NOCTURNAL WHISTLES AND WHAT OF THE
VERY PECULIAR WORDS OF THE DYING WOMAN
I CANNOT THINK
WHEN YOU COMBINE THE IDEAS OF WHISTLES AT NIGHT THE PRESENCE OF A
BAND OF GIPSIES WHO ARE ON INTIMATE TERMS WITH THIS OLD DOCTOR THE
FACT THAT WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE DOCTOR HAS AN
INTEREST IN PREVENTING HIS STEPDAUGHTERS MARRIAGE THE DYING
ALLUSION TO A BAND AND FINALLY THE FACT THAT MISS HELEN STONER
HEARD A METALLIC CLANG WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY ONE OF THOSE
METAL BARS THAT SECURED THE SHUTTERS FALLING BACK INTO ITS PLACE I
THINK THAT THERE IS GOOD GROUND TO THINK THAT THE MYSTERY MAY BE
CLEARED ALONG THOSE LINES
BUT WHAT THEN DID THE GIPSIES DO
I CANNOT IMAGINE
I SEE MANY OBJECTIONS TO ANY SUCH THEORY
AND SO DO I IT IS PRECISELY FOR THAT REASON THAT WE ARE GOING TO
STOKE MORAN THIS DAY I WANT TO SEE WHETHER THE OBJECTIONS ARE FATAL
OR IF THEY MAY BE EXPLAINED AWAY BUT WHAT IN THE NAME OF THE DEVIL
THE EJACULATION HAD BEEN DRAWN FROM MY COMPANION BY THE FACT THAT OUR
DOOR HAD BEEN SUDDENLY DASHED OPEN AND THAT A HUGE MAN HAD FRAMED
HIMSELF IN THE APERTURE HIS COSTUME WAS A PECULIAR MIXTURE OF THE
PROFESSIONAL AND OF THE AGRICULTURAL HAVING A BLACK TOPHAT A LONG
FROCKCOAT AND A PAIR OF HIGH GAITERS WITH A HUNTINGCROP SWINGING
IN HIS HAND SO TALL WAS HE THAT HIS HAT ACTUALLY BRUSHED THE CROSS
BAR OF THE DOORWAY AND HIS BREADTH SEEMED TO SPAN IT ACROSS FROM
SIDE TO SIDE A LARGE FACE SEARED WITH A THOUSAND WRINKLES BURNED
YELLOW WITH THE SUN AND MARKED WITH EVERY EVIL PASSION WAS TURNED
FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US WHILE HIS DEEPSET BILESHOT EYES AND
HIS HIGH THIN FLESHLESS NOSE GAVE HIM SOMEWHAT THE RESEMBLANCE TO
A FIERCE OLD BIRD OF PREY
WHICH OF YOU IS HOLMES ASKED THIS APPARITION
MY NAME SIR BUT YOU HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF ME SAID MY COMPANION
QUIETLY
I AM DR GRIMESBY ROYLOTT OF STOKE MORAN
INDEED DOCTOR SAID HOLMES BLANDLY PRAY TAKE A SEAT
I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND MY STEPDAUGHTER HAS BEEN HERE I HAVE
TRACED HER WHAT HAS SHE BEEN SAYING TO YOU
IT IS A LITTLE COLD FOR THE TIME OF THE YEAR SAID HOLMES
WHAT HAS SHE BEEN SAYING TO YOU SCREAMED THE OLD MAN FURIOUSLY
BUT I HAVE HEARD THAT THE CROCUSES PROMISE WELL CONTINUED MY
COMPANION IMPERTURBABLY
HA YOU PUT ME OFF DO YOU SAID OUR NEW VISITOR TAKING A STEP
FORWARD AND SHAKING HIS HUNTINGCROP I KNOW YOU YOU SCOUNDREL I
HAVE HEARD OF YOU BEFORE YOU ARE HOLMES THE MEDDLER
MY FRIEND SMILED
HOLMES THE BUSYBODY
HIS SMILE BROADENED
HOLMES THE SCOTLAND YARD JACKINOFFICE
HOLMES CHUCKLED HEARTILY YOUR CONVERSATION IS MOST ENTERTAINING
SAID HE WHEN YOU GO OUT CLOSE THE DOOR FOR THERE IS A DECIDED
DRAUGHT
I WILL GO WHEN I HAVE SAID MY SAY DONT YOU DARE TO MEDDLE WITH MY
AFFAIRS I KNOW THAT MISS STONER HAS BEEN HERE I TRACED HER I AM A
DANGEROUS MAN TO FALL FOUL OF SEE HERE HE STEPPED SWIFTLY FORWARD
SEIZED THE POKER AND BENT IT INTO A CURVE WITH HIS HUGE BROWN HANDS
SEE THAT YOU KEEP YOURSELF OUT OF MY GRIP HE SNARLED AND HURLING
THE TWISTED POKER INTO THE FIREPLACE HE STRODE OUT OF THE ROOM
HE SEEMS A VERY AMIABLE PERSON SAID HOLMES LAUGHING I AM NOT
QUITE SO BULKY BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY
GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP
THE STEEL POKER AND WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN
FANCY HIS HAVING THE INSOLENCE TO CONFOUND ME WITH THE OFFICIAL
DETECTIVE FORCE THIS INCIDENT GIVES ZEST TO OUR INVESTIGATION
HOWEVER AND I ONLY TRUST THAT OUR LITTLE FRIEND WILL NOT SUFFER FROM
HER IMPRUDENCE IN ALLOWING THIS BRUTE TO TRACE HER AND NOW WATSON
WE SHALL ORDER BREAKFAST AND AFTERWARDS I SHALL WALK DOWN TO
DOCTORS COMMONS WHERE I HOPE TO GET SOME DATA WHICH MAY HELP US IN
THIS MATTER
IT WAS NEARLY ONE OCLOCK WHEN SHERLOCK HOLMES RETURNED FROM HIS
EXCURSION HE HELD IN HIS HAND A SHEET OF BLUE PAPER SCRAWLED OVER
WITH NOTES AND FIGURES
I HAVE SEEN THE WILL OF THE DECEASED WIFE SAID HE TO DETERMINE
ITS EXACT MEANING I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO WORK OUT THE PRESENT PRICES
OF THE INVESTMENTS WITH WHICH IT IS CONCERNED THE TOTAL INCOME
WHICH AT THE TIME OF THE WIFES DEATH WAS LITTLE SHORT OF IS
NOW THROUGH THE FALL IN AGRICULTURAL PRICES NOT MORE THAN EACH
DAUGHTER CAN CLAIM AN INCOME OF IN CASE OF MARRIAGE IT IS
EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT IF BOTH GIRLS HAD MARRIED THIS BEAUTY WOULD
HAVE HAD A MERE PITTANCE WHILE EVEN ONE OF THEM WOULD CRIPPLE HIM TO
A VERY SERIOUS EXTENT MY MORNINGS WORK HAS NOT BEEN WASTED SINCE
IT HAS PROVED THAT HE HAS THE VERY STRONGEST MOTIVES FOR STANDING IN
THE WAY OF ANYTHING OF THE SORT AND NOW WATSON THIS IS TOO SERIOUS
FOR DAWDLING ESPECIALLY AS THE OLD MAN IS AWARE THAT WE ARE
INTERESTING OURSELVES IN HIS AFFAIRS SO IF YOU ARE READY WE SHALL
CALL A CAB AND DRIVE TO WATERLOO I SHOULD BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED IF
YOU WOULD SLIP YOUR REVOLVER INTO YOUR POCKET AN ELEYS NO IS AN
EXCELLENT ARGUMENT WITH GENTLEMEN WHO CAN TWIST STEEL POKERS INTO
KNOTS THAT AND A TOOTHBRUSH ARE I THINK ALL THAT WE NEED
AT WATERLOO WE WERE FORTUNATE IN CATCHING A TRAIN FOR LEATHERHEAD
WHERE WE HIRED A TRAP AT THE STATION INN AND DROVE FOR FOUR OR FIVE
MILES THROUGH THE LOVELY SURREY LANES IT WAS A PERFECT DAY WITH A
BRIGHT SUN AND A FEW FLEECY CLOUDS IN THE HEAVENS THE TREES AND
WAYSIDE HEDGES WERE JUST THROWING OUT THEIR FIRST GREEN SHOOTS AND
THE AIR WAS FULL OF THE PLEASANT SMELL OF THE MOIST EARTH TO ME AT
LEAST THERE WAS A STRANGE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE SWEET PROMISE OF THE
SPRING AND THIS SINISTER QUEST UPON WHICH WE WERE ENGAGED MY
COMPANION SAT IN THE FRONT OF THE TRAP HIS ARMS FOLDED HIS HAT
PULLED DOWN OVER HIS EYES AND HIS CHIN SUNK UPON HIS BREAST BURIED
IN THE DEEPEST THOUGHT SUDDENLY HOWEVER HE STARTED TAPPED ME ON
THE SHOULDER AND POINTED OVER THE MEADOWS
LOOK THERE SAID HE
A HEAVILY TIMBERED PARK STRETCHED UP IN A GENTLE SLOPE THICKENING
INTO A GROVE AT THE HIGHEST POINT FROM AMID THE BRANCHES THERE
JUTTED OUT THE GREY GABLES AND HIGH ROOFTREE OF A VERY OLD MANSION
STOKE MORAN SAID HE
YES SIR THAT BE THE HOUSE OF DR GRIMESBY ROYLOTT REMARKED THE
DRIVER
THERE IS SOME BUILDING GOING ON THERE SAID HOLMES THAT IS WHERE
WE ARE GOING
THERES THE VILLAGE SAID THE DRIVER POINTING TO A CLUSTER OF
ROOFS SOME DISTANCE TO THE LEFT BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET TO THE
HOUSE YOULL FIND IT SHORTER TO GET OVER THIS STILE AND SO BY THE
FOOTPATH OVER THE FIELDS THERE IT IS WHERE THE LADY IS WALKING
AND THE LADY I FANCY IS MISS STONER OBSERVED HOLMES SHADING HIS
EYES YES I THINK WE HAD BETTER DO AS YOU SUGGEST
WE GOT OFF PAID OUR FARE AND THE TRAP RATTLED BACK ON ITS WAY TO
LEATHERHEAD
I THOUGHT IT AS WELL SAID HOLMES AS WE CLIMBED THE STILE THAT
THIS FELLOW SHOULD THINK WE HAD COME HERE AS ARCHITECTS OR ON SOME
DEFINITE BUSINESS IT MAY STOP HIS GOSSIP GOODAFTERNOON MISS
STONER YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE BEEN AS GOOD AS OUR WORD
OUR CLIENT OF THE MORNING HAD HURRIED FORWARD TO MEET US WITH A FACE
WHICH SPOKE HER JOY I HAVE BEEN WAITING SO EAGERLY FOR YOU SHE
CRIED SHAKING HANDS WITH US WARMLY ALL HAS TURNED OUT SPLENDIDLY
DR ROYLOTT HAS GONE TO TOWN AND IT IS UNLIKELY THAT HE WILL BE BACK
BEFORE EVENING
WE HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF MAKING THE DOCTORS ACQUAINTANCE SAID
HOLMES AND IN A FEW WORDS HE SKETCHED OUT WHAT HAD OCCURRED MISS
STONER TURNED WHITE TO THE LIPS AS SHE LISTENED
GOOD HEAVENS SHE CRIED HE HAS FOLLOWED ME THEN
SO IT APPEARS
HE IS SO CUNNING THAT I NEVER KNOW WHEN I AM SAFE FROM HIM WHAT
WILL HE SAY WHEN HE RETURNS
HE MUST GUARD HIMSELF FOR HE MAY FIND THAT THERE IS SOMEONE MORE
CUNNING THAN HIMSELF UPON HIS TRACK YOU MUST LOCK YOURSELF UP FROM
HIM TONIGHT IF HE IS VIOLENT WE SHALL TAKE YOU AWAY TO YOUR AUNTS
AT HARROW NOW WE MUST MAKE THE BEST USE OF OUR TIME SO KINDLY TAKE
US AT ONCE TO THE ROOMS WHICH WE ARE TO EXAMINE
THE BUILDING WAS OF GREY LICHENBLOTCHED STONE WITH A HIGH CENTRAL
PORTION AND TWO CURVING WINGS LIKE THE CLAWS OF A CRAB THROWN OUT
ON EACH SIDE IN ONE OF THESE WINGS THE WINDOWS WERE BROKEN AND
BLOCKED WITH WOODEN BOARDS WHILE THE ROOF WAS PARTLY CAVED IN A
PICTURE OF RUIN THE CENTRAL PORTION WAS IN LITTLE BETTER REPAIR BUT
THE RIGHTHAND BLOCK WAS COMPARATIVELY MODERN AND THE BLINDS IN THE
WINDOWS WITH THE BLUE SMOKE CURLING UP FROM THE CHIMNEYS SHOWED
THAT THIS WAS WHERE THE FAMILY RESIDED SOME SCAFFOLDING HAD BEEN
ERECTED AGAINST THE END WALL AND THE STONEWORK HAD BEEN BROKEN
INTO BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF ANY WORKMEN AT THE MOMENT OF OUR
VISIT HOLMES WALKED SLOWLY UP AND DOWN THE ILLTRIMMED LAWN AND
EXAMINED WITH DEEP ATTENTION THE OUTSIDES OF THE WINDOWS
THIS I TAKE IT BELONGS TO THE ROOM IN WHICH YOU USED TO SLEEP THE
CENTRE ONE TO YOUR SISTERS AND THE ONE NEXT TO THE MAIN BUILDING TO
DR ROYLOTTS CHAMBER
EXACTLY SO BUT I AM NOW SLEEPING IN THE MIDDLE ONE
PENDING THE ALTERATIONS AS I UNDERSTAND BY THE WAY THERE DOES NOT
SEEM TO BE ANY VERY PRESSING NEED FOR REPAIRS AT THAT END WALL
THERE WERE NONE I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS AN EXCUSE TO MOVE ME FROM MY
ROOM
AH THAT IS SUGGESTIVE NOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS NARROW WING
RUNS THE CORRIDOR FROM WHICH THESE THREE ROOMS OPEN THERE ARE
WINDOWS IN IT OF COURSE
YES BUT VERY SMALL ONES TOO NARROW FOR ANYONE TO PASS THROUGH
AS YOU BOTH LOCKED YOUR DOORS AT NIGHT YOUR ROOMS WERE
UNAPPROACHABLE FROM THAT SIDE NOW WOULD YOU HAVE THE KINDNESS TO GO
INTO YOUR ROOM AND BAR YOUR SHUTTERS
MISS STONER DID SO AND HOLMES AFTER A CAREFUL EXAMINATION THROUGH
THE OPEN WINDOW ENDEAVOURED IN EVERY WAY TO FORCE THE SHUTTER OPEN
BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS THERE WAS NO SLIT THROUGH WHICH A KNIFE COULD BE
PASSED TO RAISE THE BAR THEN WITH HIS LENS HE TESTED THE HINGES BUT
THEY WERE OF SOLID IRON BUILT FIRMLY INTO THE MASSIVE MASONRY
HUM SAID HE SCRATCHING HIS CHIN IN SOME PERPLEXITY MY THEORY
CERTAINLY PRESENTS SOME DIFFICULTIES NO ONE COULD PASS THESE
SHUTTERS IF THEY WERE BOLTED WELL WE SHALL SEE IF THE INSIDE THROWS
ANY LIGHT UPON THE MATTER
A SMALL SIDE DOOR LED INTO THE WHITEWASHED CORRIDOR FROM WHICH THE
THREE BEDROOMS OPENED HOLMES REFUSED TO EXAMINE THE THIRD CHAMBER
SO WE PASSED AT ONCE TO THE SECOND THAT IN WHICH MISS STONER WAS NOW
SLEEPING AND IN WHICH HER SISTER HAD MET WITH HER FATE IT WAS A
HOMELY LITTLE ROOM WITH A LOW CEILING AND A GAPING FIREPLACE AFTER
THE FASHION OF OLD COUNTRYHOUSES A BROWN CHEST OF DRAWERS STOOD IN
ONE CORNER A NARROW WHITECOUNTERPANED BED IN ANOTHER AND A
DRESSINGTABLE ON THE LEFTHAND SIDE OF THE WINDOW THESE ARTICLES
WITH TWO SMALL WICKERWORK CHAIRS MADE UP ALL THE FURNITURE IN THE
ROOM SAVE FOR A SQUARE OF WILTON CARPET IN THE CENTRE THE BOARDS
ROUND AND THE PANELLING OF THE WALLS WERE OF BROWN WORMEATEN OAK
SO OLD AND DISCOLOURED THAT IT MAY HAVE DATED FROM THE ORIGINAL
BUILDING OF THE HOUSE HOLMES DREW ONE OF THE CHAIRS INTO A CORNER
AND SAT SILENT WHILE HIS EYES TRAVELLED ROUND AND ROUND AND UP AND
DOWN TAKING IN EVERY DETAIL OF THE APARTMENT
WHERE DOES THAT BELL COMMUNICATE WITH HE ASKED AT LAST POINTING TO
A THICK BELLROPE WHICH HUNG DOWN BESIDE THE BED THE TASSEL ACTUALLY
LYING UPON THE PILLOW
IT GOES TO THE HOUSEKEEPERS ROOM
IT LOOKS NEWER THAN THE OTHER THINGS
YES IT WAS ONLY PUT THERE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
YOUR SISTER ASKED FOR IT I SUPPOSE
NO I NEVER HEARD OF HER USING IT WE USED ALWAYS TO GET WHAT WE
WANTED FOR OURSELVES
INDEED IT SEEMED UNNECESSARY TO PUT SO NICE A BELLPULL THERE YOU
WILL EXCUSE ME FOR A FEW MINUTES WHILE I SATISFY MYSELF AS TO THIS
FLOOR HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN UPON HIS FACE WITH HIS LENS IN HIS HAND
AND CRAWLED SWIFTLY BACKWARD AND FORWARD EXAMINING MINUTELY THE
CRACKS BETWEEN THE BOARDS THEN HE DID THE SAME WITH THE WOODWORK
WITH WHICH THE CHAMBER WAS PANELLED FINALLY HE WALKED OVER TO THE
BED AND SPENT SOME TIME IN STARING AT IT AND IN RUNNING HIS EYE UP
AND DOWN THE WALL FINALLY HE TOOK THE BELLROPE IN HIS HAND AND GAVE
IT A BRISK TUG
WHY ITS A DUMMY SAID HE
WONT IT RING
NO IT IS NOT EVEN ATTACHED TO A WIRE THIS IS VERY INTERESTING YOU
CAN SEE NOW THAT IT IS FASTENED TO A HOOK JUST ABOVE WHERE THE LITTLE
OPENING FOR THE VENTILATOR IS
HOW VERY ABSURD I NEVER NOTICED THAT BEFORE
VERY STRANGE MUTTERED HOLMES PULLING AT THE ROPE THERE ARE ONE
OR TWO VERY SINGULAR POINTS ABOUT THIS ROOM FOR EXAMPLE WHAT A FOOL
A BUILDER MUST BE TO OPEN A VENTILATOR INTO ANOTHER ROOM WHEN WITH
THE SAME TROUBLE HE MIGHT HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH THE OUTSIDE AIR
THAT IS ALSO QUITE MODERN SAID THE LADY
DONE ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS THE BELLROPE REMARKED HOLMES
YES THERE WERE SEVERAL LITTLE CHANGES CARRIED OUT ABOUT THAT TIME
THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN OF A MOST INTERESTING CHARACTERDUMMY
BELLROPES AND VENTILATORS WHICH DO NOT VENTILATE WITH YOUR
PERMISSION MISS STONER WE SHALL NOW CARRY OUR RESEARCHES INTO THE
INNER APARTMENT
DR GRIMESBY ROYLOTTS CHAMBER WAS LARGER THAN THAT OF HIS
STEPDAUGHTER BUT WAS AS PLAINLY FURNISHED A CAMPBED A SMALL
WOODEN SHELF FULL OF BOOKS MOSTLY OF A TECHNICAL CHARACTER AN
ARMCHAIR BESIDE THE BED A PLAIN WOODEN CHAIR AGAINST THE WALL A
ROUND TABLE AND A LARGE IRON SAFE WERE THE PRINCIPAL THINGS WHICH
MET THE EYE HOLMES WALKED SLOWLY ROUND AND EXAMINED EACH AND ALL OF
THEM WITH THE KEENEST INTEREST
WHATS IN HERE HE ASKED TAPPING THE SAFE
MY STEPFATHERS BUSINESS PAPERS
OH YOU HAVE SEEN INSIDE THEN
ONLY ONCE SOME YEARS AGO I REMEMBER THAT IT WAS FULL OF PAPERS
THERE ISNT A CAT IN IT FOR EXAMPLE
NO WHAT A STRANGE IDEA
WELL LOOK AT THIS HE TOOK UP A SMALL SAUCER OF MILK WHICH STOOD
ON THE TOP OF IT
NO WE DONT KEEP A CAT BUT THERE IS A CHEETAH AND A BABOON
AH YES OF COURSE WELL A CHEETAH IS JUST A BIG CAT AND YET A
SAUCER OF MILK DOES NOT GO VERY FAR IN SATISFYING ITS WANTS I
DARESAY THERE IS ONE POINT WHICH I SHOULD WISH TO DETERMINE HE
SQUATTED DOWN IN FRONT OF THE WOODEN CHAIR AND EXAMINED THE SEAT OF
IT WITH THE GREATEST ATTENTION
THANK YOU THAT IS QUITE SETTLED SAID HE RISING AND PUTTING HIS
LENS IN HIS POCKET HULLO HERE IS SOMETHING INTERESTING
THE OBJECT WHICH HAD CAUGHT HIS EYE WAS A SMALL DOG LASH HUNG ON ONE
CORNER OF THE BED THE LASH HOWEVER WAS CURLED UPON ITSELF AND TIED
SO AS TO MAKE A LOOP OF WHIPCORD
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT WATSON
ITS A COMMON ENOUGH LASH BUT I DONT KNOW WHY IT SHOULD BE TIED
THAT IS NOT QUITE SO COMMON IS IT AH ME ITS A WICKED WORLD AND
WHEN A CLEVER MAN TURNS HIS BRAINS TO CRIME IT IS THE WORST OF ALL I
THINK THAT I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH NOW MISS STONER AND WITH YOUR
PERMISSION WE SHALL WALK OUT UPON THE LAWN
I HAD NEVER SEEN MY FRIENDS FACE SO GRIM OR HIS BROW SO DARK AS IT
WAS WHEN WE TURNED FROM THE SCENE OF THIS INVESTIGATION WE HAD
WALKED SEVERAL TIMES UP AND DOWN THE LAWN NEITHER MISS STONER NOR
MYSELF LIKING TO BREAK IN UPON HIS THOUGHTS BEFORE HE ROUSED HIMSELF
FROM HIS REVERIE
IT IS VERY ESSENTIAL MISS STONER SAID HE THAT YOU SHOULD
ABSOLUTELY FOLLOW MY ADVICE IN EVERY RESPECT
I SHALL MOST CERTAINLY DO SO
THE MATTER IS TOO SERIOUS FOR ANY HESITATION YOUR LIFE MAY DEPEND
UPON YOUR COMPLIANCE
I ASSURE YOU THAT I AM IN YOUR HANDS
IN THE FIRST PLACE BOTH MY FRIEND AND I MUST SPEND THE NIGHT IN
YOUR ROOM
BOTH MISS STONER AND I GAZED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
YES IT MUST BE SO LET ME EXPLAIN I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE
VILLAGE INN OVER THERE
YES THAT IS THE CROWN
VERY GOOD YOUR WINDOWS WOULD BE VISIBLE FROM THERE
CERTAINLY
YOU MUST CONFINE YOURSELF TO YOUR ROOM ON PRETENCE OF A HEADACHE
WHEN YOUR STEPFATHER COMES BACK THEN WHEN YOU HEAR HIM RETIRE FOR
THE NIGHT YOU MUST OPEN THE SHUTTERS OF YOUR WINDOW UNDO THE HASP
PUT YOUR LAMP THERE AS A SIGNAL TO US AND THEN WITHDRAW QUIETLY WITH
EVERYTHING WHICH YOU ARE LIKELY TO WANT INTO THE ROOM WHICH YOU USED
TO OCCUPY I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IN SPITE OF THE REPAIRS YOU COULD
MANAGE THERE FOR ONE NIGHT
OH YES EASILY
THE REST YOU WILL LEAVE IN OUR HANDS
BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO
WE SHALL SPEND THE NIGHT IN YOUR ROOM AND WE SHALL INVESTIGATE THE
CAUSE OF THIS NOISE WHICH HAS DISTURBED YOU
I BELIEVE MR HOLMES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE UP YOUR MIND
SAID MISS STONER LAYING HER HAND UPON MY COMPANIONS SLEEVE
PERHAPS I HAVE
THEN FOR PITYS SAKE TELL ME WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF MY SISTERS
DEATH
I SHOULD PREFER TO HAVE CLEARER PROOFS BEFORE I SPEAK
YOU CAN AT LEAST TELL ME WHETHER MY OWN THOUGHT IS CORRECT AND IF
SHE DIED FROM SOME SUDDEN FRIGHT
NO I DO NOT THINK SO I THINK THAT THERE WAS PROBABLY SOME MORE
TANGIBLE CAUSE AND NOW MISS STONER WE MUST LEAVE YOU FOR IF DR
ROYLOTT RETURNED AND SAW US OUR JOURNEY WOULD BE IN VAIN GOODBYE
AND BE BRAVE FOR IF YOU WILL DO WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU YOU MAY REST
ASSURED THAT WE SHALL SOON DRIVE AWAY THE DANGERS THAT THREATEN YOU
SHERLOCK HOLMES AND I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN ENGAGING A BEDROOM AND
SITTINGROOM AT THE CROWN INN THEY WERE ON THE UPPER FLOOR AND FROM
OUR WINDOW WE COULD COMMAND A VIEW OF THE AVENUE GATE AND OF THE
INHABITED WING OF STOKE MORAN MANOR HOUSE AT DUSK WE SAW DR
GRIMESBY ROYLOTT DRIVE PAST HIS HUGE FORM LOOMING UP BESIDE THE
LITTLE FIGURE OF THE LAD WHO DROVE HIM THE BOY HAD SOME SLIGHT
DIFFICULTY IN UNDOING THE HEAVY IRON GATES AND WE HEARD THE HOARSE
ROAR OF THE DOCTORS VOICE AND SAW THE FURY WITH WHICH HE SHOOK HIS
CLINCHED FISTS AT HIM THE TRAP DROVE ON AND A FEW MINUTES LATER WE
SAW A SUDDEN LIGHT SPRING UP AMONG THE TREES AS THE LAMP WAS LIT IN
ONE OF THE SITTINGROOMS
DO YOU KNOW WATSON SAID HOLMES AS WE SAT TOGETHER IN THE
GATHERING DARKNESS I HAVE REALLY SOME SCRUPLES AS TO TAKING YOU
TONIGHT THERE IS A DISTINCT ELEMENT OF DANGER
CAN I BE OF ASSISTANCE
YOUR PRESENCE MIGHT BE INVALUABLE
THEN I SHALL CERTAINLY COME
IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU
YOU SPEAK OF DANGER YOU HAVE EVIDENTLY SEEN MORE IN THESE ROOMS
THAN WAS VISIBLE TO ME
NO BUT I FANCY THAT I MAY HAVE DEDUCED A LITTLE MORE I IMAGINE
THAT YOU SAW ALL THAT I DID
I SAW NOTHING REMARKABLE SAVE THE BELLROPE AND WHAT PURPOSE THAT
COULD ANSWER I CONFESS IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
YOU SAW THE VENTILATOR TOO
YES BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT IT IS SUCH A VERY UNUSUAL THING TO HAVE
A SMALL OPENING BETWEEN TWO ROOMS IT WAS SO SMALL THAT A RAT COULD
HARDLY PASS THROUGH
I KNEW THAT WE SHOULD FIND A VENTILATOR BEFORE EVER WE CAME TO STOKE
MORAN
MY DEAR HOLMES
OH YES I DID YOU REMEMBER IN HER STATEMENT SHE SAID THAT HER
SISTER COULD SMELL DR ROYLOTTS CIGAR NOW OF COURSE THAT SUGGESTED
AT ONCE THAT THERE MUST BE A COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE TWO ROOMS IT
COULD ONLY BE A SMALL ONE OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REMARKED UPON AT THE
CORONERS INQUIRY I DEDUCED A VENTILATOR
BUT WHAT HARM CAN THERE BE IN THAT
WELL THERE IS AT LEAST A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE OF DATES A VENTILATOR
IS MADE A CORD IS HUNG AND A LADY WHO SLEEPS IN THE BED DIES DOES
NOT THAT STRIKE YOU
I CANNOT AS YET SEE ANY CONNECTION
DID YOU OBSERVE ANYTHING VERY PECULIAR ABOUT THAT BED
NO
IT WAS CLAMPED TO THE FLOOR DID YOU EVER SEE A BED FASTENED LIKE
THAT BEFORE
I CANNOT SAY THAT I HAVE
THE LADY COULD NOT MOVE HER BED IT MUST ALWAYS BE IN THE SAME
RELATIVE POSITION TO THE VENTILATOR AND TO THE ROPEOR SO WE MAY
CALL IT SINCE IT WAS CLEARLY NEVER MEANT FOR A BELLPULL
HOLMES I CRIED I SEEM TO SEE DIMLY WHAT YOU ARE HINTING AT WE
ARE ONLY JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT SOME SUBTLE AND HORRIBLE CRIME
SUBTLE ENOUGH AND HORRIBLE ENOUGH WHEN A DOCTOR DOES GO WRONG HE IS
THE FIRST OF CRIMINALS HE HAS NERVE AND HE HAS KNOWLEDGE PALMER AND
PRITCHARD WERE AMONG THE HEADS OF THEIR PROFESSION THIS MAN STRIKES
EVEN DEEPER BUT I THINK WATSON THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO STRIKE
DEEPER STILL BUT WE SHALL HAVE HORRORS ENOUGH BEFORE THE NIGHT IS
OVER FOR GOODNESS SAKE LET US HAVE A QUIET PIPE AND TURN OUR MINDS
FOR A FEW HOURS TO SOMETHING MORE CHEERFUL
ABOUT NINE OCLOCK THE LIGHT AMONG THE TREES WAS EXTINGUISHED AND
ALL WAS DARK IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MANOR HOUSE TWO HOURS PASSED
SLOWLY AWAY AND THEN SUDDENLY JUST AT THE STROKE OF ELEVEN A
SINGLE BRIGHT LIGHT SHONE OUT RIGHT IN FRONT OF US
THAT IS OUR SIGNAL SAID HOLMES SPRINGING TO HIS FEET IT COMES
FROM THE MIDDLE WINDOW
AS WE PASSED OUT HE EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS WITH THE LANDLORD
EXPLAINING THAT WE WERE GOING ON A LATE VISIT TO AN ACQUAINTANCE AND
THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT WE MIGHT SPEND THE NIGHT THERE A MOMENT
LATER WE WERE OUT ON THE DARK ROAD A CHILL WIND BLOWING IN OUR
FACES AND ONE YELLOW LIGHT TWINKLING IN FRONT OF US THROUGH THE
GLOOM TO GUIDE US ON OUR SOMBRE ERRAND
THERE WAS LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN ENTERING THE GROUNDS FOR UNREPAIRED
BREACHES GAPED IN THE OLD PARK WALL MAKING OUR WAY AMONG THE TREES
WE REACHED THE LAWN CROSSED IT AND WERE ABOUT TO ENTER THROUGH THE
WINDOW WHEN OUT FROM A CLUMP OF LAUREL BUSHES THERE DARTED WHAT
SEEMED TO BE A HIDEOUS AND DISTORTED CHILD WHO THREW ITSELF UPON THE
GRASS WITH WRITHING LIMBS AND THEN RAN SWIFTLY ACROSS THE LAWN INTO
THE DARKNESS
MY GOD I WHISPERED DID YOU SEE IT
HOLMES WAS FOR THE MOMENT AS STARTLED AS I HIS HAND CLOSED LIKE A
VICE UPON MY WRIST IN HIS AGITATION THEN HE BROKE INTO A LOW LAUGH
AND PUT HIS LIPS TO MY EAR
IT IS A NICE HOUSEHOLD HE MURMURED THAT IS THE BABOON
I HAD FORGOTTEN THE STRANGE PETS WHICH THE DOCTOR AFFECTED THERE WAS
A CHEETAH TOO PERHAPS WE MIGHT FIND IT UPON OUR SHOULDERS AT ANY
MOMENT I CONFESS THAT I FELT EASIER IN MY MIND WHEN AFTER FOLLOWING
HOLMES EXAMPLE AND SLIPPING OFF MY SHOES I FOUND MYSELF INSIDE THE
BEDROOM MY COMPANION NOISELESSLY CLOSED THE SHUTTERS MOVED THE LAMP
ONTO THE TABLE AND CAST HIS EYES ROUND THE ROOM ALL WAS AS WE HAD
SEEN IT IN THE DAYTIME THEN CREEPING UP TO ME AND MAKING A TRUMPET
OF HIS HAND HE WHISPERED INTO MY EAR AGAIN SO GENTLY THAT IT WAS ALL
THAT I COULD DO TO DISTINGUISH THE WORDS
THE LEAST SOUND WOULD BE FATAL TO OUR PLANS
I NODDED TO SHOW THAT I HAD HEARD
WE MUST SIT WITHOUT LIGHT HE WOULD SEE IT THROUGH THE VENTILATOR
I NODDED AGAIN
DO NOT GO ASLEEP YOUR VERY LIFE MAY DEPEND UPON IT HAVE YOUR
PISTOL READY IN CASE WE SHOULD NEED IT I WILL SIT ON THE SIDE OF THE
BED AND YOU IN THAT CHAIR
I TOOK OUT MY REVOLVER AND LAID IT ON THE CORNER OF THE TABLE
HOLMES HAD BROUGHT UP A LONG THIN CANE AND THIS HE PLACED UPON THE
BED BESIDE HIM BY IT HE LAID THE BOX OF MATCHES AND THE STUMP OF A
CANDLE THEN HE TURNED DOWN THE LAMP AND WE WERE LEFT IN DARKNESS
HOW SHALL I EVER FORGET THAT DREADFUL VIGIL I COULD NOT HEAR A
SOUND NOT EVEN THE DRAWING OF A BREATH AND YET I KNEW THAT MY
COMPANION SAT OPENEYED WITHIN A FEW FEET OF ME IN THE SAME STATE
OF NERVOUS TENSION IN WHICH I WAS MYSELF THE SHUTTERS CUT OFF THE
LEAST RAY OF LIGHT AND WE WAITED IN ABSOLUTE DARKNESS
FROM OUTSIDE CAME THE OCCASIONAL CRY OF A NIGHTBIRD AND ONCE AT OUR
VERY WINDOW A LONG DRAWN CATLIKE WHINE WHICH TOLD US THAT THE
CHEETAH WAS INDEED AT LIBERTY FAR AWAY WE COULD HEAR THE DEEP TONES
OF THE PARISH CLOCK WHICH BOOMED OUT EVERY QUARTER OF AN HOUR HOW
LONG THEY SEEMED THOSE QUARTERS TWELVE STRUCK AND ONE AND TWO AND
THREE AND STILL WE SAT WAITING SILENTLY FOR WHATEVER MIGHT BEFALL
SUDDENLY THERE WAS THE MOMENTARY GLEAM OF A LIGHT UP IN THE DIRECTION
OF THE VENTILATOR WHICH VANISHED IMMEDIATELY BUT WAS SUCCEEDED BY A
STRONG SMELL OF BURNING OIL AND HEATED METAL SOMEONE IN THE NEXT
ROOM HAD LIT A DARKLANTERN I HEARD A GENTLE SOUND OF MOVEMENT AND
THEN ALL WAS SILENT ONCE MORE THOUGH THE SMELL GREW STRONGER FOR
HALF AN HOUR I SAT WITH STRAINING EARS THEN SUDDENLY ANOTHER SOUND
BECAME AUDIBLEA VERY GENTLE SOOTHING SOUND LIKE THAT OF A SMALL
JET OF STEAM ESCAPING CONTINUALLY FROM A KETTLE THE INSTANT THAT WE
HEARD IT HOLMES SPRANG FROM THE BED STRUCK A MATCH AND LASHED
FURIOUSLY WITH HIS CANE AT THE BELLPULL
YOU SEE IT WATSON HE YELLED YOU SEE IT
BUT I SAW NOTHING AT THE MOMENT WHEN HOLMES STRUCK THE LIGHT I HEARD
A LOW CLEAR WHISTLE BUT THE SUDDEN GLARE FLASHING INTO MY WEARY
EYES MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TELL WHAT IT WAS AT WHICH MY FRIEND
LASHED SO SAVAGELY I COULD HOWEVER SEE THAT HIS FACE WAS DEADLY
PALE AND FILLED WITH HORROR AND LOATHING HE HAD CEASED TO STRIKE AND
WAS GAZING UP AT THE VENTILATOR WHEN SUDDENLY THERE BROKE FROM THE
SILENCE OF THE NIGHT THE MOST HORRIBLE CRY TO WHICH I HAVE EVER
LISTENED IT SWELLED UP LOUDER AND LOUDER A HOARSE YELL OF PAIN AND
FEAR AND ANGER ALL MINGLED IN THE ONE DREADFUL SHRIEK THEY SAY THAT
AWAY DOWN IN THE VILLAGE AND EVEN IN THE DISTANT PARSONAGE THAT CRY
RAISED THE SLEEPERS FROM THEIR BEDS IT STRUCK COLD TO OUR HEARTS
AND I STOOD GAZING AT HOLMES AND HE AT ME UNTIL THE LAST ECHOES OF
IT HAD DIED AWAY INTO THE SILENCE FROM WHICH IT ROSE
WHAT CAN IT MEAN I GASPED
IT MEANS THAT IT IS ALL OVER HOLMES ANSWERED AND PERHAPS AFTER
ALL IT IS FOR THE BEST TAKE YOUR PISTOL AND WE WILL ENTER DR
ROYLOTTS ROOM
WITH A GRAVE FACE HE LIT THE LAMP AND LED THE WAY DOWN THE CORRIDOR
TWICE HE STRUCK AT THE CHAMBER DOOR WITHOUT ANY REPLY FROM WITHIN
THEN HE TURNED THE HANDLE AND ENTERED I AT HIS HEELS WITH THE
COCKED PISTOL IN MY HAND
IT WAS A SINGULAR SIGHT WHICH MET OUR EYES ON THE TABLE STOOD A
DARKLANTERN WITH THE SHUTTER HALF OPEN THROWING A BRILLIANT BEAM OF
LIGHT UPON THE IRON SAFE THE DOOR OF WHICH WAS AJAR BESIDE THIS
TABLE ON THE WOODEN CHAIR SAT DR GRIMESBY ROYLOTT CLAD IN A LONG
GREY DRESSINGGOWN HIS BARE ANKLES PROTRUDING BENEATH AND HIS FEET
THRUST INTO RED HEELLESS TURKISH SLIPPERS ACROSS HIS LAP LAY THE
SHORT STOCK WITH THE LONG LASH WHICH WE HAD NOTICED DURING THE DAY
HIS CHIN WAS COCKED UPWARD AND HIS EYES WERE FIXED IN A DREADFUL
RIGID STARE AT THE CORNER OF THE CEILING ROUND HIS BROW HE HAD A
PECULIAR YELLOW BAND WITH BROWNISH SPECKLES WHICH SEEMED TO BE
BOUND TIGHTLY ROUND HIS HEAD AS WE ENTERED HE MADE NEITHER SOUND NOR
MOTION
THE BAND THE SPECKLED BAND WHISPERED HOLMES
I TOOK A STEP FORWARD IN AN INSTANT HIS STRANGE HEADGEAR BEGAN TO
MOVE AND THERE REARED ITSELF FROM AMONG HIS HAIR THE SQUAT
DIAMONDSHAPED HEAD AND PUFFED NECK OF A LOATHSOME SERPENT
IT IS A SWAMP ADDER CRIED HOLMES THE DEADLIEST SNAKE IN INDIA
HE HAS DIED WITHIN TEN SECONDS OF BEING BITTEN VIOLENCE DOES IN
TRUTH RECOIL UPON THE VIOLENT AND THE SCHEMER FALLS INTO THE PIT
WHICH HE DIGS FOR ANOTHER LET US THRUST THIS CREATURE BACK INTO ITS
DEN AND WE CAN THEN REMOVE MISS STONER TO SOME PLACE OF SHELTER AND
LET THE COUNTY POLICE KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED
AS HE SPOKE HE DREW THE DOGWHIP SWIFTLY FROM THE DEAD MANS LAP AND
THROWING THE NOOSE ROUND THE REPTILES NECK HE DREW IT FROM ITS
HORRID PERCH AND CARRYING IT AT ARMS LENGTH THREW IT INTO THE IRON
SAFE WHICH HE CLOSED UPON IT
SUCH ARE THE TRUE FACTS OF THE DEATH OF DR GRIMESBY ROYLOTT OF
STOKE MORAN IT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD PROLONG A NARRATIVE
WHICH HAS ALREADY RUN TO TOO GREAT A LENGTH BY TELLING HOW WE BROKE
THE SAD NEWS TO THE TERRIFIED GIRL HOW WE CONVEYED HER BY THE
MORNING TRAIN TO THE CARE OF HER GOOD AUNT AT HARROW OF HOW THE SLOW
PROCESS OF OFFICIAL INQUIRY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE DOCTOR
MET HIS FATE WHILE INDISCREETLY PLAYING WITH A DANGEROUS PET THE
LITTLE WHICH I HAD YET TO LEARN OF THE CASE WAS TOLD ME BY SHERLOCK
HOLMES AS WE TRAVELLED BACK NEXT DAY
I HAD SAID HE COME TO AN ENTIRELY ERRONEOUS CONCLUSION WHICH
SHOWS MY DEAR WATSON HOW DANGEROUS IT ALWAYS IS TO REASON FROM
INSUFFICIENT DATA THE PRESENCE OF THE GIPSIES AND THE USE OF THE
WORD BAND WHICH WAS USED BY THE POOR GIRL NO DOUBT TO EXPLAIN
THE APPEARANCE WHICH SHE HAD CAUGHT A HURRIED GLIMPSE OF BY THE LIGHT
OF HER MATCH WERE SUFFICIENT TO PUT ME UPON AN ENTIRELY WRONG SCENT
I CAN ONLY CLAIM THE MERIT THAT I INSTANTLY RECONSIDERED MY POSITION
WHEN HOWEVER IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT WHATEVER DANGER THREATENED
AN OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM COULD NOT COME EITHER FROM THE WINDOW OR THE
DOOR MY ATTENTION WAS SPEEDILY DRAWN AS I HAVE ALREADY REMARKED TO
YOU TO THIS VENTILATOR AND TO THE BELLROPE WHICH HUNG DOWN TO THE
BED THE DISCOVERY THAT THIS WAS A DUMMY AND THAT THE BED WAS
CLAMPED TO THE FLOOR INSTANTLY GAVE RISE TO THE SUSPICION THAT THE
ROPE WAS THERE AS A BRIDGE FOR SOMETHING PASSING THROUGH THE HOLE AND
COMING TO THE BED THE IDEA OF A SNAKE INSTANTLY OCCURRED TO ME AND
WHEN I COUPLED IT WITH MY KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DOCTOR WAS FURNISHED
WITH A SUPPLY OF CREATURES FROM INDIA I FELT THAT I WAS PROBABLY ON
THE RIGHT TRACK THE IDEA OF USING A FORM OF POISON WHICH COULD NOT
POSSIBLY BE DISCOVERED BY ANY CHEMICAL TEST WAS JUST SUCH A ONE AS
WOULD OCCUR TO A CLEVER AND RUTHLESS MAN WHO HAD HAD AN EASTERN
TRAINING THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH SUCH A POISON WOULD TAKE EFFECT
WOULD ALSO FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW BE AN ADVANTAGE IT WOULD BE A
SHARPEYED CORONER INDEED WHO COULD DISTINGUISH THE TWO LITTLE DARK
PUNCTURES WHICH WOULD SHOW WHERE THE POISON FANGS HAD DONE THEIR
WORK THEN I THOUGHT OF THE WHISTLE OF COURSE HE MUST RECALL THE
SNAKE BEFORE THE MORNING LIGHT REVEALED IT TO THE VICTIM HE HAD
TRAINED IT PROBABLY BY THE USE OF THE MILK WHICH WE SAW TO RETURN
TO HIM WHEN SUMMONED HE WOULD PUT IT THROUGH THIS VENTILATOR AT THE
HOUR THAT HE THOUGHT BEST WITH THE CERTAINTY THAT IT WOULD CRAWL
DOWN THE ROPE AND LAND ON THE BED IT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BITE THE
OCCUPANT PERHAPS SHE MIGHT ESCAPE EVERY NIGHT FOR A WEEK BUT SOONER
OR LATER SHE MUST FALL A VICTIM
I HAD COME TO THESE CONCLUSIONS BEFORE EVER I HAD ENTERED HIS ROOM
AN INSPECTION OF HIS CHAIR SHOWED ME THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF
STANDING ON IT WHICH OF COURSE WOULD BE NECESSARY IN ORDER THAT HE
SHOULD REACH THE VENTILATOR THE SIGHT OF THE SAFE THE SAUCER OF
MILK AND THE LOOP OF WHIPCORD WERE ENOUGH TO FINALLY DISPEL ANY
DOUBTS WHICH MAY HAVE REMAINED THE METALLIC CLANG HEARD BY MISS
STONER WAS OBVIOUSLY CAUSED BY HER STEPFATHER HASTILY CLOSING THE
DOOR OF HIS SAFE UPON ITS TERRIBLE OCCUPANT HAVING ONCE MADE UP MY
MIND YOU KNOW THE STEPS WHICH I TOOK IN ORDER TO PUT THE MATTER TO
THE PROOF I HEARD THE CREATURE HISS AS I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU DID
ALSO AND I INSTANTLY LIT THE LIGHT AND ATTACKED IT
WITH THE RESULT OF DRIVING IT THROUGH THE VENTILATOR
AND ALSO WITH THE RESULT OF CAUSING IT TO TURN UPON ITS MASTER AT
THE OTHER SIDE SOME OF THE BLOWS OF MY CANE CAME HOME AND ROUSED ITS
SNAKISH TEMPER SO THAT IT FLEW UPON THE FIRST PERSON IT SAW IN THIS
WAY I AM NO DOUBT INDIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DR GRIMESBY ROYLOTTS
DEATH AND I CANNOT SAY THAT IT IS LIKELY TO WEIGH VERY HEAVILY UPON
MY CONSCIENCE
THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEERS THUMB
OF ALL THE PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO MY FRIEND MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR SOLUTION DURING THE YEARS OF OUR INTIMACY THERE
WERE ONLY TWO WHICH I WAS THE MEANS OF INTRODUCING TO HIS
NOTICETHAT OF MR HATHERLEYS THUMB AND THAT OF COLONEL
WARBURTONS MADNESS OF THESE THE LATTER MAY HAVE AFFORDED A FINER
FIELD FOR AN ACUTE AND ORIGINAL OBSERVER BUT THE OTHER WAS SO
STRANGE IN ITS INCEPTION AND SO DRAMATIC IN ITS DETAILS THAT IT MAY
BE THE MORE WORTHY OF BEING PLACED UPON RECORD EVEN IF IT GAVE MY
FRIEND FEWER OPENINGS FOR THOSE DEDUCTIVE METHODS OF REASONING BY
WHICH HE ACHIEVED SUCH REMARKABLE RESULTS THE STORY HAS I BELIEVE
BEEN TOLD MORE THAN ONCE IN THE NEWSPAPERS BUT LIKE ALL SUCH
NARRATIVES ITS EFFECT IS MUCH LESS STRIKING WHEN SET FORTH EN BLOC
IN A SINGLE HALFCOLUMN OF PRINT THAN WHEN THE FACTS SLOWLY EVOLVE
BEFORE YOUR OWN EYES AND THE MYSTERY CLEARS GRADUALLY AWAY AS EACH
NEW DISCOVERY FURNISHES A STEP WHICH LEADS ON TO THE COMPLETE TRUTH
AT THE TIME THE CIRCUMSTANCES MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION UPON ME AND THE
LAPSE OF TWO YEARS HAS HARDLY SERVED TO WEAKEN THE EFFECT
IT WAS IN THE SUMMER OF NOT LONG AFTER MY MARRIAGE THAT THE
EVENTS OCCURRED WHICH I AM NOW ABOUT TO SUMMARISE I HAD RETURNED TO
CIVIL PRACTICE AND HAD FINALLY ABANDONED HOLMES IN HIS BAKER STREET
ROOMS ALTHOUGH I CONTINUALLY VISITED HIM AND OCCASIONALLY EVEN
PERSUADED HIM TO FORGO HIS BOHEMIAN HABITS SO FAR AS TO COME AND
VISIT US MY PRACTICE HAD STEADILY INCREASED AND AS I HAPPENED TO
LIVE AT NO VERY GREAT DISTANCE FROM PADDINGTON STATION I GOT A FEW
PATIENTS FROM AMONG THE OFFICIALS ONE OF THESE WHOM I HAD CURED OF
A PAINFUL AND LINGERING DISEASE WAS NEVER WEARY OF ADVERTISING MY
VIRTUES AND OF ENDEAVOURING TO SEND ME ON EVERY SUFFERER OVER WHOM HE
MIGHT HAVE ANY INFLUENCE
ONE MORNING AT A LITTLE BEFORE SEVEN OCLOCK I WAS AWAKENED BY THE
MAID TAPPING AT THE DOOR TO ANNOUNCE THAT TWO MEN HAD COME FROM
PADDINGTON AND WERE WAITING IN THE CONSULTINGROOM I DRESSED
HURRIEDLY FOR I KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT RAILWAY CASES WERE SELDOM
TRIVIAL AND HASTENED DOWNSTAIRS AS I DESCENDED MY OLD ALLY THE
GUARD CAME OUT OF THE ROOM AND CLOSED THE DOOR TIGHTLY BEHIND HIM
IVE GOT HIM HERE HE WHISPERED JERKING HIS THUMB OVER HIS
SHOULDER HES ALL RIGHT
WHAT IS IT THEN I ASKED FOR HIS MANNER SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS
SOME STRANGE CREATURE WHICH HE HAD CAGED UP IN MY ROOM
ITS A NEW PATIENT HE WHISPERED I THOUGHT ID BRING HIM ROUND
MYSELF THEN HE COULDNT SLIP AWAY THERE HE IS ALL SAFE AND SOUND
I MUST GO NOW DOCTOR I HAVE MY DOOTIES JUST THE SAME AS YOU AND
OFF HE WENT THIS TRUSTY TOUT WITHOUT EVEN GIVING ME TIME TO THANK
HIM
I ENTERED MY CONSULTINGROOM AND FOUND A GENTLEMAN SEATED BY THE
TABLE HE WAS QUIETLY DRESSED IN A SUIT OF HEATHER TWEED WITH A SOFT
CLOTH CAP WHICH HE HAD LAID DOWN UPON MY BOOKS ROUND ONE OF HIS
HANDS HE HAD A HANDKERCHIEF WRAPPED WHICH WAS MOTTLED ALL OVER WITH
BLOODSTAINS HE WAS YOUNG NOT MORE THAN FIVEANDTWENTY I SHOULD
SAY WITH A STRONG MASCULINE FACE BUT HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY PALE AND
GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION OF A MAN WHO WAS SUFFERING FROM SOME STRONG
AGITATION WHICH IT TOOK ALL HIS STRENGTH OF MIND TO CONTROL
I AM SORRY TO KNOCK YOU UP SO EARLY DOCTOR SAID HE BUT I HAVE
HAD A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT DURING THE NIGHT I CAME IN BY TRAIN THIS
MORNING AND ON INQUIRING AT PADDINGTON AS TO WHERE I MIGHT FIND A
DOCTOR A WORTHY FELLOW VERY KINDLY ESCORTED ME HERE I GAVE THE MAID
A CARD BUT I SEE THAT SHE HAS LEFT IT UPON THE SIDETABLE
I TOOK IT UP AND GLANCED AT IT MR VICTOR HATHERLEY HYDRAULIC
ENGINEER A VICTORIA STREET RD FLOOR THAT WAS THE NAME
STYLE AND ABODE OF MY MORNING VISITOR I REGRET THAT I HAVE KEPT
YOU WAITING SAID I SITTING DOWN IN MY LIBRARYCHAIR YOU ARE
FRESH FROM A NIGHT JOURNEY I UNDERSTAND WHICH IS IN ITSELF A
MONOTONOUS OCCUPATION
OH MY NIGHT COULD NOT BE CALLED MONOTONOUS SAID HE AND LAUGHED
HE LAUGHED VERY HEARTILY WITH A HIGH RINGING NOTE LEANING BACK IN
HIS CHAIR AND SHAKING HIS SIDES ALL MY MEDICAL INSTINCTS ROSE UP
AGAINST THAT LAUGH
STOP IT I CRIED PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER AND I POURED OUT SOME
WATER FROM A CARAFFE
IT WAS USELESS HOWEVER HE WAS OFF IN ONE OF THOSE HYSTERICAL
OUTBURSTS WHICH COME UPON A STRONG NATURE WHEN SOME GREAT CRISIS IS
OVER AND GONE PRESENTLY HE CAME TO HIMSELF ONCE MORE VERY WEARY AND
PALELOOKING
I HAVE BEEN MAKING A FOOL OF MYSELF HE GASPED
NOT AT ALL DRINK THIS I DASHED SOME BRANDY INTO THE WATER AND
THE COLOUR BEGAN TO COME BACK TO HIS BLOODLESS CHEEKS
THATS BETTER SAID HE AND NOW DOCTOR PERHAPS YOU WOULD KINDLY
ATTEND TO MY THUMB OR RATHER TO THE PLACE WHERE MY THUMB USED TO
BE
HE UNWOUND THE HANDKERCHIEF AND HELD OUT HIS HAND IT GAVE EVEN MY
HARDENED NERVES A SHUDDER TO LOOK AT IT THERE WERE FOUR PROTRUDING
FINGERS AND A HORRID RED SPONGY SURFACE WHERE THE THUMB SHOULD HAVE
BEEN IT HAD BEEN HACKED OR TORN RIGHT OUT FROM THE ROOTS
GOOD HEAVENS I CRIED THIS IS A TERRIBLE INJURY IT MUST HAVE
BLED CONSIDERABLY
YES IT DID I FAINTED WHEN IT WAS DONE AND I THINK THAT I MUST
HAVE BEEN SENSELESS FOR A LONG TIME WHEN I CAME TO I FOUND THAT IT
WAS STILL BLEEDING SO I TIED ONE END OF MY HANDKERCHIEF VERY TIGHTLY
ROUND THE WRIST AND BRACED IT UP WITH A TWIG
EXCELLENT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SURGEON
IT IS A QUESTION OF HYDRAULICS YOU SEE AND CAME WITHIN MY OWN
PROVINCE
THIS HAS BEEN DONE SAID I EXAMINING THE WOUND BY A VERY HEAVY
AND SHARP INSTRUMENT
A THING LIKE A CLEAVER SAID HE
AN ACCIDENT I PRESUME
BY NO MEANS
WHAT A MURDEROUS ATTACK
VERY MURDEROUS INDEED
YOU HORRIFY ME
I SPONGED THE WOUND CLEANED IT DRESSED IT AND FINALLY COVERED IT
OVER WITH COTTON WADDING AND CARBOLISED BANDAGES HE LAY BACK WITHOUT
WINCING THOUGH HE BIT HIS LIP FROM TIME TO TIME
HOW IS THAT I ASKED WHEN I HAD FINISHED
CAPITAL BETWEEN YOUR BRANDY AND YOUR BANDAGE I FEEL A NEW MAN I
WAS VERY WEAK BUT I HAVE HAD A GOOD DEAL TO GO THROUGH
PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER NOT SPEAK OF THE MATTER IT IS EVIDENTLY
TRYING TO YOUR NERVES
OH NO NOT NOW I SHALL HAVE TO TELL MY TALE TO THE POLICE BUT
BETWEEN OURSELVES IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF THIS
WOUND OF MINE I SHOULD BE SURPRISED IF THEY BELIEVED MY STATEMENT
FOR IT IS A VERY EXTRAORDINARY ONE AND I HAVE NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF
PROOF WITH WHICH TO BACK IT UP AND EVEN IF THEY BELIEVE ME THE
CLUES WHICH I CAN GIVE THEM ARE SO VAGUE THAT IT IS A QUESTION
WHETHER JUSTICE WILL BE DONE
HA CRIED I IF IT IS ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF A PROBLEM WHICH
YOU DESIRE TO SEE SOLVED I SHOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TO COME TO
MY FRIEND MR SHERLOCK HOLMES BEFORE YOU GO TO THE OFFICIAL
POLICE
OH I HAVE HEARD OF THAT FELLOW ANSWERED MY VISITOR AND I SHOULD
BE VERY GLAD IF HE WOULD TAKE THE MATTER UP THOUGH OF COURSE I MUST
USE THE OFFICIAL POLICE AS WELL WOULD YOU GIVE ME AN INTRODUCTION TO
HIM
ILL DO BETTER ILL TAKE YOU ROUND TO HIM MYSELF
I SHOULD BE IMMENSELY OBLIGED TO YOU
WELL CALL A CAB AND GO TOGETHER WE SHALL JUST BE IN TIME TO HAVE A
LITTLE BREAKFAST WITH HIM DO YOU FEEL EQUAL TO IT
YES I SHALL NOT FEEL EASY UNTIL I HAVE TOLD MY STORY
THEN MY SERVANT WILL CALL A CAB AND I SHALL BE WITH YOU IN AN
INSTANT I RUSHED UPSTAIRS EXPLAINED THE MATTER SHORTLY TO MY WIFE
AND IN FIVE MINUTES WAS INSIDE A HANSOM DRIVING WITH MY NEW
ACQUAINTANCE TO BAKER STREET
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS AS I EXPECTED LOUNGING ABOUT HIS SITTINGROOM
IN HIS DRESSINGGOWN READING THE AGONY COLUMN OF THE TIMES AND
SMOKING HIS BEFOREBREAKFAST PIPE WHICH WAS COMPOSED OF ALL THE
PLUGS AND DOTTLES LEFT FROM HIS SMOKES OF THE DAY BEFORE ALL
CAREFULLY DRIED AND COLLECTED ON THE CORNER OF THE MANTELPIECE HE
RECEIVED US IN HIS QUIETLY GENIAL FASHION ORDERED FRESH RASHERS AND
EGGS AND JOINED US IN A HEARTY MEAL WHEN IT WAS CONCLUDED HE
SETTLED OUR NEW ACQUAINTANCE UPON THE SOFA PLACED A PILLOW BENEATH
HIS HEAD AND LAID A GLASS OF BRANDY AND WATER WITHIN HIS REACH
IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN NO COMMON ONE MR
HATHERLEY SAID HE PRAY LIE DOWN THERE AND MAKE YOURSELF
ABSOLUTELY AT HOME TELL US WHAT YOU CAN BUT STOP WHEN YOU ARE TIRED
AND KEEP UP YOUR STRENGTH WITH A LITTLE STIMULANT
THANK YOU SAID MY PATIENT BUT I HAVE FELT ANOTHER MAN SINCE THE
DOCTOR BANDAGED ME AND I THINK THAT YOUR BREAKFAST HAS COMPLETED THE
CURE I SHALL TAKE UP AS LITTLE OF YOUR VALUABLE TIME AS POSSIBLE SO
I SHALL START AT ONCE UPON MY PECULIAR EXPERIENCES
HOLMES SAT IN HIS BIG ARMCHAIR WITH THE WEARY HEAVYLIDDED
EXPRESSION WHICH VEILED HIS KEEN AND EAGER NATURE WHILE I SAT
OPPOSITE TO HIM AND WE LISTENED IN SILENCE TO THE STRANGE STORY
WHICH OUR VISITOR DETAILED TO US
YOU MUST KNOW SAID HE THAT I AM AN ORPHAN AND A BACHELOR
RESIDING ALONE IN LODGINGS IN LONDON BY PROFESSION I AM A HYDRAULIC
ENGINEER AND I HAVE HAD CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE OF MY WORK DURING
THE SEVEN YEARS THAT I WAS APPRENTICED TO VENNER MATHESON THE
WELLKNOWN FIRM OF GREENWICH TWO YEARS AGO HAVING SERVED MY TIME
AND HAVING ALSO COME INTO A FAIR SUM OF MONEY THROUGH MY POOR
FATHERS DEATH I DETERMINED TO START IN BUSINESS FOR MYSELF AND TOOK
PROFESSIONAL CHAMBERS IN VICTORIA STREET
I SUPPOSE THAT EVERYONE FINDS HIS FIRST INDEPENDENT START IN
BUSINESS A DREARY EXPERIENCE TO ME IT HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY SO
DURING TWO YEARS I HAVE HAD THREE CONSULTATIONS AND ONE SMALL JOB
AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ALL THAT MY PROFESSION HAS BROUGHT ME MY
GROSS TAKINGS AMOUNT TO S EVERY DAY FROM NINE IN THE MORNING
UNTIL FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON I WAITED IN MY LITTLE DEN UNTIL AT LAST
MY HEART BEGAN TO SINK AND I CAME TO BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE ANY PRACTICE AT ALL
YESTERDAY HOWEVER JUST AS I WAS THINKING OF LEAVING THE OFFICE MY
CLERK ENTERED TO SAY THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN WAITING WHO WISHED TO SEE
ME UPON BUSINESS HE BROUGHT UP A CARD TOO WITH THE NAME OF
COLONEL LYSANDER STARK ENGRAVED UPON IT CLOSE AT HIS HEELS CAME
THE COLONEL HIMSELF A MAN RATHER OVER THE MIDDLE SIZE BUT OF AN
EXCEEDING THINNESS I DO NOT THINK THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN SO THIN A
MAN HIS WHOLE FACE SHARPENED AWAY INTO NOSE AND CHIN AND THE SKIN
OF HIS CHEEKS WAS DRAWN QUITE TENSE OVER HIS OUTSTANDING BONES YET
THIS EMACIATION SEEMED TO BE HIS NATURAL HABIT AND DUE TO NO
DISEASE FOR HIS EYE WAS BRIGHT HIS STEP BRISK AND HIS BEARING
ASSURED HE WAS PLAINLY BUT NEATLY DRESSED AND HIS AGE I SHOULD
JUDGE WOULD BE NEARER FORTY THAN THIRTY
MR HATHERLEY SAID HE WITH SOMETHING OF A GERMAN ACCENT YOU
HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED TO ME MR HATHERLEY AS BEING A MAN WHO IS NOT
ONLY PROFICIENT IN HIS PROFESSION BUT IS ALSO DISCREET AND CAPABLE OF
PRESERVING A SECRET
I BOWED FEELING AS FLATTERED AS ANY YOUNG MAN WOULD AT SUCH AN
ADDRESS MAY I ASK WHO IT WAS WHO GAVE ME SO GOOD A CHARACTER WELL
PERHAPS IT IS BETTER THAT I SHOULD NOT TELL YOU THAT JUST AT
THIS MOMENT I HAVE IT FROM THE SAME SOURCE THAT YOU ARE BOTH AN
ORPHAN AND A BACHELOR AND ARE RESIDING ALONE IN LONDON
THAT IS QUITE CORRECT I ANSWERED BUT YOU WILL EXCUSE ME IF I
SAY THAT I CANNOT SEE HOW ALL THIS BEARS UPON MY PROFESSIONAL
QUALIFICATIONS I UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS ON A PROFESSIONAL MATTER
THAT YOU WISHED TO SPEAK TO ME
UNDOUBTEDLY SO BUT YOU WILL FIND THAT ALL I SAY IS REALLY TO THE
POINT I HAVE A PROFESSIONAL COMMISSION FOR YOU BUT ABSOLUTE SECRECY
IS QUITE ESSENTIALABSOLUTE SECRECY YOU UNDERSTAND AND OF COURSE
WE MAY EXPECT THAT MORE FROM A MAN WHO IS ALONE THAN FROM ONE WHO
LIVES IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY
IF I PROMISE TO KEEP A SECRET SAID I YOU MAY ABSOLUTELY DEPEND
UPON MY DOING SO
HE LOOKED VERY HARD AT ME AS I SPOKE AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD
NEVER SEEN SO SUSPICIOUS AND QUESTIONING AN EYE
DO YOU PROMISE THEN SAID HE AT LAST
YES I PROMISE
ABSOLUTE AND COMPLETE SILENCE BEFORE DURING AND AFTER NO
REFERENCE TO THE MATTER AT ALL EITHER IN WORD OR WRITING
I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN YOU MY WORD
VERY GOOD HE SUDDENLY SPRANG UP AND DARTING LIKE LIGHTNING
ACROSS THE ROOM HE FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR THE PASSAGE OUTSIDE WAS
EMPTY
THATS ALL RIGHT SAID HE COMING BACK I KNOW THAT CLERKS ARE
SOMETIMES CURIOUS AS TO THEIR MASTERS AFFAIRS NOW WE CAN TALK IN
SAFETY HE DREW UP HIS CHAIR VERY CLOSE TO MINE AND BEGAN TO STARE
AT ME AGAIN WITH THE SAME QUESTIONING AND THOUGHTFUL LOOK
A FEELING OF REPULSION AND OF SOMETHING AKIN TO FEAR HAD BEGUN TO
RISE WITHIN ME AT THE STRANGE ANTICS OF THIS FLESHLESS MAN EVEN MY
DREAD OF LOSING A CLIENT COULD NOT RESTRAIN ME FROM SHOWING MY
IMPATIENCE
I BEG THAT YOU WILL STATE YOUR BUSINESS SIR SAID I MY TIME IS
OF VALUE HEAVEN FORGIVE ME FOR THAT LAST SENTENCE BUT THE WORDS
CAME TO MY LIPS
HOW WOULD FIFTY GUINEAS FOR A NIGHTS WORK SUIT YOU HE ASKED
MOST ADMIRABLY
I SAY A NIGHTS WORK BUT AN HOURS WOULD BE NEARER THE MARK I
SIMPLY WANT YOUR OPINION ABOUT A HYDRAULIC STAMPING MACHINE WHICH HAS
GOT OUT OF GEAR IF YOU SHOW US WHAT IS WRONG WE SHALL SOON SET IT
RIGHT OURSELVES WHAT DO YOU THINK OF SUCH A COMMISSION AS THAT
THE WORK APPEARS TO BE LIGHT AND THE PAY MUNIFICENT
PRECISELY SO WE SHALL WANT YOU TO COME TONIGHT BY THE LAST
TRAIN
WHERE TO
TO EYFORD IN BERKSHIRE IT IS A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE BORDERS OF
OXFORDSHIRE AND WITHIN SEVEN MILES OF READING THERE IS A TRAIN FROM
PADDINGTON WHICH WOULD BRING YOU THERE AT ABOUT VERY GOOD
I SHALL COME DOWN IN A CARRIAGE TO MEET YOU
THERE IS A DRIVE THEN
YES OUR LITTLE PLACE IS QUITE OUT IN THE COUNTRY IT IS A GOOD
SEVEN MILES FROM EYFORD STATION
THEN WE CAN HARDLY GET THERE BEFORE MIDNIGHT I SUPPOSE THERE WOULD
BE NO CHANCE OF A TRAIN BACK I SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO STOP THE
NIGHT
YES WE COULD EASILY GIVE YOU A SHAKEDOWN
THAT IS VERY AWKWARD COULD I NOT COME AT SOME MORE CONVENIENT
HOUR
WE HAVE JUDGED IT BEST THAT YOU SHOULD COME LATE IT IS TO
RECOMPENSE YOU FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE THAT WE ARE PAYING TO YOU A
YOUNG AND UNKNOWN MAN A FEE WHICH WOULD BUY AN OPINION FROM THE VERY
HEADS OF YOUR PROFESSION STILL OF COURSE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO DRAW
OUT OF THE BUSINESS THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME TO DO SO
I THOUGHT OF THE FIFTY GUINEAS AND OF HOW VERY USEFUL THEY WOULD BE
TO ME NOT AT ALL SAID I I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY TO ACCOMMODATE
MYSELF TO YOUR WISHES I SHOULD LIKE HOWEVER TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE
MORE CLEARLY WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WISH ME TO DO
QUITE SO IT IS VERY NATURAL THAT THE PLEDGE OF SECRECY WHICH WE
HAVE EXACTED FROM YOU SHOULD HAVE AROUSED YOUR CURIOSITY I HAVE NO
WISH TO COMMIT YOU TO ANYTHING WITHOUT YOUR HAVING IT ALL LAID BEFORE
YOU I SUPPOSE THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY SAFE FROM EAVESDROPPERS
ENTIRELY
THEN THE MATTER STANDS THUS YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE THAT
FULLERSEARTH IS A VALUABLE PRODUCT AND THAT IT IS ONLY FOUND IN
ONE OR TWO PLACES IN ENGLAND
I HAVE HEARD SO
SOME LITTLE TIME AGO I BOUGHT A SMALL PLACEA VERY SMALL
PLACEWITHIN TEN MILES OF READING I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO
DISCOVER THAT THERE WAS A DEPOSIT OF FULLERSEARTH IN ONE OF MY
FIELDS ON EXAMINING IT HOWEVER I FOUND THAT THIS DEPOSIT WAS A
COMPARATIVELY SMALL ONE AND THAT IT FORMED A LINK BETWEEN TWO VERY
MUCH LARGER ONES UPON THE RIGHT AND LEFTBOTH OF THEM HOWEVER IN
THE GROUNDS OF MY NEIGHBOURS THESE GOOD PEOPLE WERE ABSOLUTELY
IGNORANT THAT THEIR LAND CONTAINED THAT WHICH WAS QUITE AS VALUABLE
AS A GOLDMINE NATURALLY IT WAS TO MY INTEREST TO BUY THEIR LAND
BEFORE THEY DISCOVERED ITS TRUE VALUE BUT UNFORTUNATELY I HAD NO
CAPITAL BY WHICH I COULD DO THIS I TOOK A FEW OF MY FRIENDS INTO THE
SECRET HOWEVER AND THEY SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD QUIETLY AND
SECRETLY WORK OUR OWN LITTLE DEPOSIT AND THAT IN THIS WAY WE SHOULD
EARN THE MONEY WHICH WOULD ENABLE US TO BUY THE NEIGHBOURING FIELDS
THIS WE HAVE NOW BEEN DOING FOR SOME TIME AND IN ORDER TO HELP US IN
OUR OPERATIONS WE ERECTED A HYDRAULIC PRESS THIS PRESS AS I HAVE
ALREADY EXPLAINED HAS GOT OUT OF ORDER AND WE WISH YOUR ADVICE UPON
THE SUBJECT WE GUARD OUR SECRET VERY JEALOUSLY HOWEVER AND IF IT
ONCE BECAME KNOWN THAT WE HAD HYDRAULIC ENGINEERS COMING TO OUR
LITTLE HOUSE IT WOULD SOON ROUSE INQUIRY AND THEN IF THE FACTS
CAME OUT IT WOULD BE GOODBYE TO ANY CHANCE OF GETTING THESE FIELDS
AND CARRYING OUT OUR PLANS THAT IS WHY I HAVE MADE YOU PROMISE ME
THAT YOU WILL NOT TELL A HUMAN BEING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO EYFORD
TONIGHT I HOPE THAT I MAKE IT ALL PLAIN
I QUITE FOLLOW YOU SAID I THE ONLY POINT WHICH I COULD NOT
QUITE UNDERSTAND WAS WHAT USE YOU COULD MAKE OF A HYDRAULIC PRESS IN
EXCAVATING FULLERSEARTH WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND IS DUG OUT LIKE
GRAVEL FROM A PIT
AH SAID HE CARELESSLY WE HAVE OUR OWN PROCESS WE COMPRESS THE
EARTH INTO BRICKS SO AS TO REMOVE THEM WITHOUT REVEALING WHAT THEY
ARE BUT THAT IS A MERE DETAIL I HAVE TAKEN YOU FULLY INTO MY
CONFIDENCE NOW MR HATHERLEY AND I HAVE SHOWN YOU HOW I TRUST YOU
HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE I SHALL EXPECT YOU THEN AT EYFORD AT I SHALL
CERTAINLY BE THERE
AND NOT A WORD TO A SOUL HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A LAST LONG
QUESTIONING GAZE AND THEN PRESSING MY HAND IN A COLD DANK GRASP
HE HURRIED FROM THE ROOM
WELL WHEN I CAME TO THINK IT ALL OVER IN COOL BLOOD I WAS VERY MUCH
ASTONISHED AS YOU MAY BOTH THINK AT THIS SUDDEN COMMISSION WHICH
HAD BEEN INTRUSTED TO ME ON THE ONE HAND OF COURSE I WAS GLAD FOR
THE FEE WAS AT LEAST TENFOLD WHAT I SHOULD HAVE ASKED HAD I SET A
PRICE UPON MY OWN SERVICES AND IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THIS ORDER MIGHT
LEAD TO OTHER ONES ON THE OTHER HAND THE FACE AND MANNER OF MY
PATRON HAD MADE AN UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION UPON ME AND I COULD NOT
THINK THAT HIS EXPLANATION OF THE FULLERSEARTH WAS SUFFICIENT TO
EXPLAIN THE NECESSITY FOR MY COMING AT MIDNIGHT AND HIS EXTREME
ANXIETY LEST I SHOULD TELL ANYONE OF MY ERRAND HOWEVER I THREW ALL
FEARS TO THE WINDS ATE A HEARTY SUPPER DROVE TO PADDINGTON AND
STARTED OFF HAVING OBEYED TO THE LETTER THE INJUNCTION AS TO HOLDING
MY TONGUE
AT READING I HAD TO CHANGE NOT ONLY MY CARRIAGE BUT MY STATION
HOWEVER I WAS IN TIME FOR THE LAST TRAIN TO EYFORD AND I REACHED
THE LITTLE DIMLIT STATION AFTER ELEVEN OCLOCK I WAS THE ONLY
PASSENGER WHO GOT OUT THERE AND THERE WAS NO ONE UPON THE PLATFORM
SAVE A SINGLE SLEEPY PORTER WITH A LANTERN AS I PASSED OUT THROUGH
THE WICKET GATE HOWEVER I FOUND MY ACQUAINTANCE OF THE MORNING
WAITING IN THE SHADOW UPON THE OTHER SIDE WITHOUT A WORD HE GRASPED
MY ARM AND HURRIED ME INTO A CARRIAGE THE DOOR OF WHICH WAS STANDING
OPEN HE DREW UP THE WINDOWS ON EITHER SIDE TAPPED ON THE WOODWORK
AND AWAY WE WENT AS FAST AS THE HORSE COULD GO
ONE HORSE INTERJECTED HOLMES
YES ONLY ONE
DID YOU OBSERVE THE COLOUR
YES I SAW IT BY THE SIDELIGHTS WHEN I WAS STEPPING INTO THE
CARRIAGE IT WAS A CHESTNUT
TIREDLOOKING OR FRESH
OH FRESH AND GLOSSY
THANK YOU I AM SORRY TO HAVE INTERRUPTED YOU PRAY CONTINUE YOUR
MOST INTERESTING STATEMENT
AWAY WE WENT THEN AND WE DROVE FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR COLONEL
LYSANDER STARK HAD SAID THAT IT WAS ONLY SEVEN MILES BUT I SHOULD
THINK FROM THE RATE THAT WE SEEMED TO GO AND FROM THE TIME THAT WE
TOOK THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN NEARER TWELVE HE SAT AT MY SIDE IN
SILENCE ALL THE TIME AND I WAS AWARE MORE THAN ONCE WHEN I GLANCED
IN HIS DIRECTION THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT ME WITH GREAT INTENSITY THE
COUNTRY ROADS SEEM TO BE NOT VERY GOOD IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD FOR
WE LURCHED AND JOLTED TERRIBLY I TRIED TO LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOWS TO
SEE SOMETHING OF WHERE WE WERE BUT THEY WERE MADE OF FROSTED GLASS
AND I COULD MAKE OUT NOTHING SAVE THE OCCASIONAL BRIGHT BLUR OF A
PASSING LIGHT NOW AND THEN I HAZARDED SOME REMARK TO BREAK THE
MONOTONY OF THE JOURNEY BUT THE COLONEL ANSWERED ONLY IN
MONOSYLLABLES AND THE CONVERSATION SOON FLAGGED AT LAST HOWEVER
THE BUMPING OF THE ROAD WAS EXCHANGED FOR THE CRISP SMOOTHNESS OF A
GRAVELDRIVE AND THE CARRIAGE CAME TO A STAND COLONEL LYSANDER
STARK SPRANG OUT AND AS I FOLLOWED AFTER HIM PULLED ME SWIFTLY
INTO A PORCH WHICH GAPED IN FRONT OF US WE STEPPED AS IT WERE
RIGHT OUT OF THE CARRIAGE AND INTO THE HALL SO THAT I FAILED TO
CATCH THE MOST FLEETING GLANCE OF THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE THE INSTANT
THAT I HAD CROSSED THE THRESHOLD THE DOOR SLAMMED HEAVILY BEHIND US
AND I HEARD FAINTLY THE RATTLE OF THE WHEELS AS THE CARRIAGE DROVE
AWAY
IT WAS PITCH DARK INSIDE THE HOUSE AND THE COLONEL FUMBLED ABOUT
LOOKING FOR MATCHES AND MUTTERING UNDER HIS BREATH SUDDENLY A DOOR
OPENED AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGE AND A LONG GOLDEN BAR OF
LIGHT SHOT OUT IN OUR DIRECTION IT GREW BROADER AND A WOMAN
APPEARED WITH A LAMP IN HER HAND WHICH SHE HELD ABOVE HER HEAD
PUSHING HER FACE FORWARD AND PEERING AT US I COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS
PRETTY AND FROM THE GLOSS WITH WHICH THE LIGHT SHONE UPON HER DARK
DRESS I KNEW THAT IT WAS A RICH MATERIAL SHE SPOKE A FEW WORDS IN A
FOREIGN TONGUE IN A TONE AS THOUGH ASKING A QUESTION AND WHEN MY
COMPANION ANSWERED IN A GRUFF MONOSYLLABLE SHE GAVE SUCH A START THAT
THE LAMP NEARLY FELL FROM HER HAND COLONEL STARK WENT UP TO HER
WHISPERED SOMETHING IN HER EAR AND THEN PUSHING HER BACK INTO THE
ROOM FROM WHENCE SHE HAD COME HE WALKED TOWARDS ME AGAIN WITH THE
LAMP IN HIS HAND
PERHAPS YOU WILL HAVE THE KINDNESS TO WAIT IN THIS ROOM FOR A FEW
MINUTES SAID HE THROWING OPEN ANOTHER DOOR IT WAS A QUIET
LITTLE PLAINLY FURNISHED ROOM WITH A ROUND TABLE IN THE CENTRE ON
WHICH SEVERAL GERMAN BOOKS WERE SCATTERED COLONEL STARK LAID DOWN
THE LAMP ON THE TOP OF A HARMONIUM BESIDE THE DOOR I SHALL NOT KEEP
YOU WAITING AN INSTANT SAID HE AND VANISHED INTO THE DARKNESS
I GLANCED AT THE BOOKS UPON THE TABLE AND IN SPITE OF MY IGNORANCE
OF GERMAN I COULD SEE THAT TWO OF THEM WERE TREATISES ON SCIENCE THE
OTHERS BEING VOLUMES OF POETRY THEN I WALKED ACROSS TO THE WINDOW
HOPING THAT I MIGHT CATCH SOME GLIMPSE OF THE COUNTRYSIDE BUT AN
OAK SHUTTER HEAVILY BARRED WAS FOLDED ACROSS IT IT WAS A
WONDERFULLY SILENT HOUSE THERE WAS AN OLD CLOCK TICKING LOUDLY
SOMEWHERE IN THE PASSAGE BUT OTHERWISE EVERYTHING WAS DEADLY STILL
A VAGUE FEELING OF UNEASINESS BEGAN TO STEAL OVER ME WHO WERE THESE
GERMAN PEOPLE AND WHAT WERE THEY DOING LIVING IN THIS STRANGE
OUTOFTHEWAY PLACE AND WHERE WAS THE PLACE I WAS TEN MILES OR SO
FROM EYFORD THAT WAS ALL I KNEW BUT WHETHER NORTH SOUTH EAST OR
WEST I HAD NO IDEA FOR THAT MATTER READING AND POSSIBLY OTHER
LARGE TOWNS WERE WITHIN THAT RADIUS SO THE PLACE MIGHT NOT BE SO
SECLUDED AFTER ALL YET IT WAS QUITE CERTAIN FROM THE ABSOLUTE
STILLNESS THAT WE WERE IN THE COUNTRY I PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
HUMMING A TUNE UNDER MY BREATH TO KEEP UP MY SPIRITS AND FEELING THAT
I WAS THOROUGHLY EARNING MY FIFTYGUINEA FEE
SUDDENLY WITHOUT ANY PRELIMINARY SOUND IN THE MIDST OF THE UTTER
STILLNESS THE DOOR OF MY ROOM SWUNG SLOWLY OPEN THE WOMAN WAS
STANDING IN THE APERTURE THE DARKNESS OF THE HALL BEHIND HER THE
YELLOW LIGHT FROM MY LAMP BEATING UPON HER EAGER AND BEAUTIFUL FACE
I COULD SEE AT A GLANCE THAT SHE WAS SICK WITH FEAR AND THE SIGHT
SENT A CHILL TO MY OWN HEART SHE HELD UP ONE SHAKING FINGER TO WARN
ME TO BE SILENT AND SHE SHOT A FEW WHISPERED WORDS OF BROKEN ENGLISH
AT ME HER EYES GLANCING BACK LIKE THOSE OF A FRIGHTENED HORSE INTO
THE GLOOM BEHIND HER
I WOULD GO SAID SHE TRYING HARD AS IT SEEMED TO ME TO SPEAK
CALMLY I WOULD GO I SHOULD NOT STAY HERE THERE IS NO GOOD FOR YOU
TO DO
BUT MADAM SAID I I HAVE NOT YET DONE WHAT I CAME FOR I CANNOT
POSSIBLY LEAVE UNTIL I HAVE SEEN THE MACHINE
IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR WHILE TO WAIT SHE WENT ON YOU CAN PASS
THROUGH THE DOOR NO ONE HINDERS AND THEN SEEING THAT I SMILED AND
SHOOK MY HEAD SHE SUDDENLY THREW ASIDE HER CONSTRAINT AND MADE A
STEP FORWARD WITH HER HANDS WRUNG TOGETHER FOR THE LOVE OF
HEAVEN SHE WHISPERED GET AWAY FROM HERE BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE
BUT I AM SOMEWHAT HEADSTRONG BY NATURE AND THE MORE READY TO ENGAGE
IN AN AFFAIR WHEN THERE IS SOME OBSTACLE IN THE WAY I THOUGHT OF MY
FIFTYGUINEA FEE OF MY WEARISOME JOURNEY AND OF THE UNPLEASANT
NIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO BE BEFORE ME WAS IT ALL TO GO FOR NOTHING WHY
SHOULD I SLINK AWAY WITHOUT HAVING CARRIED OUT MY COMMISSION AND
WITHOUT THE PAYMENT WHICH WAS MY DUE THIS WOMAN MIGHT FOR ALL I
KNEW BE A MONOMANIAC WITH A STOUT BEARING THEREFORE THOUGH HER
MANNER HAD SHAKEN ME MORE THAN I CARED TO CONFESS I STILL SHOOK MY
HEAD AND DECLARED MY INTENTION OF REMAINING WHERE I WAS SHE WAS
ABOUT TO RENEW HER ENTREATIES WHEN A DOOR SLAMMED OVERHEAD AND THE
SOUND OF SEVERAL FOOTSTEPS WAS HEARD UPON THE STAIRS SHE LISTENED
FOR AN INSTANT THREW UP HER HANDS WITH A DESPAIRING GESTURE AND
VANISHED AS SUDDENLY AND AS NOISELESSLY AS SHE HAD COME
THE NEWCOMERS WERE COLONEL LYSANDER STARK AND A SHORT THICK MAN WITH
A CHINCHILLA BEARD GROWING OUT OF THE CREASES OF HIS DOUBLE CHIN WHO
WAS INTRODUCED TO ME AS MR FERGUSON
THIS IS MY SECRETARY AND MANAGER SAID THE COLONEL BY THE WAY I
WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I LEFT THIS DOOR SHUT JUST NOW I FEAR
THAT YOU HAVE FELT THE DRAUGHT
ON THE CONTRARY SAID I I OPENED THE DOOR MYSELF BECAUSE I FELT
THE ROOM TO BE A LITTLE CLOSE
HE SHOT ONE OF HIS SUSPICIOUS LOOKS AT ME PERHAPS WE HAD BETTER
PROCEED TO BUSINESS THEN SAID HE MR FERGUSON AND I WILL TAKE
YOU UP TO SEE THE MACHINE
I HAD BETTER PUT MY HAT ON I SUPPOSE
OH NO IT IS IN THE HOUSE
WHAT YOU DIG FULLERSEARTH IN THE HOUSE
NO NO THIS IS ONLY WHERE WE COMPRESS IT BUT NEVER MIND THAT ALL
WE WISH YOU TO DO IS TO EXAMINE THE MACHINE AND TO LET US KNOW WHAT
IS WRONG WITH IT
WE WENT UPSTAIRS TOGETHER THE COLONEL FIRST WITH THE LAMP THE FAT
MANAGER AND I BEHIND HIM IT WAS A LABYRINTH OF AN OLD HOUSE WITH
CORRIDORS PASSAGES NARROW WINDING STAIRCASES AND LITTLE LOW DOORS
THE THRESHOLDS OF WHICH WERE HOLLOWED OUT BY THE GENERATIONS WHO HAD
CROSSED THEM THERE WERE NO CARPETS AND NO SIGNS OF ANY FURNITURE
ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR WHILE THE PLASTER WAS PEELING OFF THE WALLS
AND THE DAMP WAS BREAKING THROUGH IN GREEN UNHEALTHY BLOTCHES I
TRIED TO PUT ON AS UNCONCERNED AN AIR AS POSSIBLE BUT I HAD NOT
FORGOTTEN THE WARNINGS OF THE LADY EVEN THOUGH I DISREGARDED THEM
AND I KEPT A KEEN EYE UPON MY TWO COMPANIONS FERGUSON APPEARED TO BE
A MOROSE AND SILENT MAN BUT I COULD SEE FROM THE LITTLE THAT HE SAID
THAT HE WAS AT LEAST A FELLOWCOUNTRYMAN
COLONEL LYSANDER STARK STOPPED AT LAST BEFORE A LOW DOOR WHICH HE
UNLOCKED WITHIN WAS A SMALL SQUARE ROOM IN WHICH THE THREE OF US
COULD HARDLY GET AT ONE TIME FERGUSON REMAINED OUTSIDE AND THE
COLONEL USHERED ME IN
WE ARE NOW SAID HE ACTUALLY WITHIN THE HYDRAULIC PRESS AND IT
WOULD BE A PARTICULARLY UNPLEASANT THING FOR US IF ANYONE WERE TO
TURN IT ON THE CEILING OF THIS SMALL CHAMBER IS REALLY THE END OF
THE DESCENDING PISTON AND IT COMES DOWN WITH THE FORCE OF MANY TONS
UPON THIS METAL FLOOR THERE ARE SMALL LATERAL COLUMNS OF WATER
OUTSIDE WHICH RECEIVE THE FORCE AND WHICH TRANSMIT AND MULTIPLY IT
IN THE MANNER WHICH IS FAMILIAR TO YOU THE MACHINE GOES READILY
ENOUGH BUT THERE IS SOME STIFFNESS IN THE WORKING OF IT AND IT HAS
LOST A LITTLE OF ITS FORCE PERHAPS YOU WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO
LOOK IT OVER AND TO SHOW US HOW WE CAN SET IT RIGHT
I TOOK THE LAMP FROM HIM AND I EXAMINED THE MACHINE VERY
THOROUGHLY IT WAS INDEED A GIGANTIC ONE AND CAPABLE OF EXERCISING
ENORMOUS PRESSURE WHEN I PASSED OUTSIDE HOWEVER AND PRESSED DOWN
THE LEVERS WHICH CONTROLLED IT I KNEW AT ONCE BY THE WHISHING SOUND
THAT THERE WAS A SLIGHT LEAKAGE WHICH ALLOWED A REGURGITATION OF
WATER THROUGH ONE OF THE SIDE CYLINDERS AN EXAMINATION SHOWED THAT
ONE OF THE INDIARUBBER BANDS WHICH WAS ROUND THE HEAD OF A
DRIVINGROD HAD SHRUNK SO AS NOT QUITE TO FILL THE SOCKET ALONG WHICH
IT WORKED THIS WAS CLEARLY THE CAUSE OF THE LOSS OF POWER AND I
POINTED IT OUT TO MY COMPANIONS WHO FOLLOWED MY REMARKS VERY
CAREFULLY AND ASKED SEVERAL PRACTICAL QUESTIONS AS TO HOW THEY SHOULD
PROCEED TO SET IT RIGHT WHEN I HAD MADE IT CLEAR TO THEM I RETURNED
TO THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE MACHINE AND TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT IT TO
SATISFY MY OWN CURIOSITY IT WAS OBVIOUS AT A GLANCE THAT THE STORY
OF THE FULLERSEARTH WAS THE MEREST FABRICATION FOR IT WOULD BE
ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THAT SO POWERFUL AN ENGINE COULD BE DESIGNED FOR SO
INADEQUATE A PURPOSE THE WALLS WERE OF WOOD BUT THE FLOOR CONSISTED
OF A LARGE IRON TROUGH AND WHEN I CAME TO EXAMINE IT I COULD SEE A
CRUST OF METALLIC DEPOSIT ALL OVER IT I HAD STOOPED AND WAS SCRAPING
AT THIS TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS WHEN I HEARD A MUTTERED
EXCLAMATION IN GERMAN AND SAW THE CADAVEROUS FACE OF THE COLONEL
LOOKING DOWN AT ME
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE HE ASKED
I FELT ANGRY AT HAVING BEEN TRICKED BY SO ELABORATE A STORY AS THAT
WHICH HE HAD TOLD ME I WAS ADMIRING YOUR FULLERSEARTH SAID I
I THINK THAT I SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO ADVISE YOU AS TO YOUR
MACHINE IF I KNEW WHAT THE EXACT PURPOSE WAS FOR WHICH IT WAS USED
THE INSTANT THAT I UTTERED THE WORDS I REGRETTED THE RASHNESS OF MY
SPEECH HIS FACE SET HARD AND A BALEFUL LIGHT SPRANG UP IN HIS GREY
EYES
VERY WELL SAID HE YOU SHALL KNOW ALL ABOUT THE MACHINE HE
TOOK A STEP BACKWARD SLAMMED THE LITTLE DOOR AND TURNED THE KEY IN
THE LOCK I RUSHED TOWARDS IT AND PULLED AT THE HANDLE BUT IT WAS
QUITE SECURE AND DID NOT GIVE IN THE LEAST TO MY KICKS AND SHOVES
HULLO I YELLED HULLO COLONEL LET ME OUT
AND THEN SUDDENLY IN THE SILENCE I HEARD A SOUND WHICH SENT MY HEART
INTO MY MOUTH IT WAS THE CLANK OF THE LEVERS AND THE SWISH OF THE
LEAKING CYLINDER HE HAD SET THE ENGINE AT WORK THE LAMP STILL STOOD
UPON THE FLOOR WHERE I HAD PLACED IT WHEN EXAMINING THE TROUGH BY
ITS LIGHT I SAW THAT THE BLACK CEILING WAS COMING DOWN UPON ME
SLOWLY JERKILY BUT AS NONE KNEW BETTER THAN MYSELF WITH A FORCE
WHICH MUST WITHIN A MINUTE GRIND ME TO A SHAPELESS PULP I THREW
MYSELF SCREAMING AGAINST THE DOOR AND DRAGGED WITH MY NAILS AT THE
LOCK I IMPLORED THE COLONEL TO LET ME OUT BUT THE REMORSELESS
CLANKING OF THE LEVERS DROWNED MY CRIES THE CEILING WAS ONLY A FOOT
OR TWO ABOVE MY HEAD AND WITH MY HAND UPRAISED I COULD FEEL ITS
HARD ROUGH SURFACE THEN IT FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND THAT THE PAIN OF
MY DEATH WOULD DEPEND VERY MUCH UPON THE POSITION IN WHICH I MET IT
IF I LAY ON MY FACE THE WEIGHT WOULD COME UPON MY SPINE AND I
SHUDDERED TO THINK OF THAT DREADFUL SNAP EASIER THE OTHER WAY
PERHAPS AND YET HAD I THE NERVE TO LIE AND LOOK UP AT THAT DEADLY
BLACK SHADOW WAVERING DOWN UPON ME ALREADY I WAS UNABLE TO STAND
ERECT WHEN MY EYE CAUGHT SOMETHING WHICH BROUGHT A GUSH OF HOPE BACK
TO MY HEART
I HAVE SAID THAT THOUGH THE FLOOR AND CEILING WERE OF IRON THE
WALLS WERE OF WOOD AS I GAVE A LAST HURRIED GLANCE AROUND I SAW A
THIN LINE OF YELLOW LIGHT BETWEEN TWO OF THE BOARDS WHICH BROADENED
AND BROADENED AS A SMALL PANEL WAS PUSHED BACKWARD FOR AN INSTANT I
COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT HERE WAS INDEED A DOOR WHICH LED AWAY FROM
DEATH THE NEXT INSTANT I THREW MYSELF THROUGH AND LAY HALFFAINTING
UPON THE OTHER SIDE THE PANEL HAD CLOSED AGAIN BEHIND ME BUT THE
CRASH OF THE LAMP AND A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARDS THE CLANG OF THE TWO
SLABS OF METAL TOLD ME HOW NARROW HAD BEEN MY ESCAPE
I WAS RECALLED TO MYSELF BY A FRANTIC PLUCKING AT MY WRIST AND I
FOUND MYSELF LYING UPON THE STONE FLOOR OF A NARROW CORRIDOR WHILE A
WOMAN BENT OVER ME AND TUGGED AT ME WITH HER LEFT HAND WHILE SHE
HELD A CANDLE IN HER RIGHT IT WAS THE SAME GOOD FRIEND WHOSE WARNING
I HAD SO FOOLISHLY REJECTED
COME COME SHE CRIED BREATHLESSLY THEY WILL BE HERE IN A
MOMENT THEY WILL SEE THAT YOU ARE NOT THERE OH DO NOT WASTE THE
SOPRECIOUS TIME BUT COME
THIS TIME AT LEAST I DID NOT SCORN HER ADVICE I STAGGERED TO MY
FEET AND RAN WITH HER ALONG THE CORRIDOR AND DOWN A WINDING STAIR
THE LATTER LED TO ANOTHER BROAD PASSAGE AND JUST AS WE REACHED IT WE
HEARD THE SOUND OF RUNNING FEET AND THE SHOUTING OF TWO VOICES ONE
ANSWERING THE OTHER FROM THE FLOOR ON WHICH WE WERE AND FROM THE ONE
BENEATH MY GUIDE STOPPED AND LOOKED ABOUT HER LIKE ONE WHO IS AT
HER WITS END THEN SHE THREW OPEN A DOOR WHICH LED INTO A BEDROOM
THROUGH THE WINDOW OF WHICH THE MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY
IT IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE SAID SHE IT IS HIGH BUT IT MAY BE THAT
YOU CAN JUMP IT
AS SHE SPOKE A LIGHT SPRANG INTO VIEW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE
PASSAGE AND I SAW THE LEAN FIGURE OF COLONEL LYSANDER STARK RUSHING
FORWARD WITH A LANTERN IN ONE HAND AND A WEAPON LIKE A BUTCHERS
CLEAVER IN THE OTHER I RUSHED ACROSS THE BEDROOM FLUNG OPEN THE
WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT HOW QUIET AND SWEET AND WHOLESOME THE GARDEN
LOOKED IN THE MOONLIGHT AND IT COULD NOT BE MORE THAN THIRTY FEET
DOWN I CLAMBERED OUT UPON THE SILL BUT I HESITATED TO JUMP UNTIL I
SHOULD HAVE HEARD WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MY SAVIOUR AND THE RUFFIAN WHO
PURSUED ME IF SHE WERE ILLUSED THEN AT ANY RISKS I WAS DETERMINED
TO GO BACK TO HER ASSISTANCE THE THOUGHT HAD HARDLY FLASHED THROUGH
MY MIND BEFORE HE WAS AT THE DOOR PUSHING HIS WAY PAST HER BUT SHE
THREW HER ARMS ROUND HIM AND TRIED TO HOLD HIM BACK
FRITZ FRITZ SHE CRIED IN ENGLISH REMEMBER YOUR PROMISE AFTER
THE LAST TIME YOU SAID IT SHOULD NOT BE AGAIN HE WILL BE SILENT
OH HE WILL BE SILENT
YOU ARE MAD ELISE HE SHOUTED STRUGGLING TO BREAK AWAY FROM HER
YOU WILL BE THE RUIN OF US HE HAS SEEN TOO MUCH LET ME PASS I
SAY HE DASHED HER TO ONE SIDE AND RUSHING TO THE WINDOW CUT AT
ME WITH HIS HEAVY WEAPON I HAD LET MYSELF GO AND WAS HANGING BY THE
HANDS TO THE SILL WHEN HIS BLOW FELL I WAS CONSCIOUS OF A DULL
PAIN MY GRIP LOOSENED AND I FELL INTO THE GARDEN BELOW
I WAS SHAKEN BUT NOT HURT BY THE FALL SO I PICKED MYSELF UP AND
RUSHED OFF AMONG THE BUSHES AS HARD AS I COULD RUN FOR I UNDERSTOOD
THAT I WAS FAR FROM BEING OUT OF DANGER YET SUDDENLY HOWEVER AS I
RAN A DEADLY DIZZINESS AND SICKNESS CAME OVER ME I GLANCED DOWN AT
MY HAND WHICH WAS THROBBING PAINFULLY AND THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME
SAW THAT MY THUMB HAD BEEN CUT OFF AND THAT THE BLOOD WAS POURING
FROM MY WOUND I ENDEAVOURED TO TIE MY HANDKERCHIEF ROUND IT BUT
THERE CAME A SUDDEN BUZZING IN MY EARS AND NEXT MOMENT I FELL IN A
DEAD FAINT AMONG THE ROSEBUSHES
HOW LONG I REMAINED UNCONSCIOUS I CANNOT TELL IT MUST HAVE BEEN A
VERY LONG TIME FOR THE MOON HAD SUNK AND A BRIGHT MORNING WAS
BREAKING WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF MY CLOTHES WERE ALL SODDEN WITH DEW
AND MY COATSLEEVE WAS DRENCHED WITH BLOOD FROM MY WOUNDED THUMB THE
SMARTING OF IT RECALLED IN AN INSTANT ALL THE PARTICULARS OF MY
NIGHTS ADVENTURE AND I SPRANG TO MY FEET WITH THE FEELING THAT I
MIGHT HARDLY YET BE SAFE FROM MY PURSUERS BUT TO MY ASTONISHMENT
WHEN I CAME TO LOOK ROUND ME NEITHER HOUSE NOR GARDEN WERE TO BE
SEEN I HAD BEEN LYING IN AN ANGLE OF THE HEDGE CLOSE BY THE
HIGHROAD AND JUST A LITTLE LOWER DOWN WAS A LONG BUILDING WHICH
PROVED UPON MY APPROACHING IT TO BE THE VERY STATION AT WHICH I HAD
ARRIVED UPON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WERE IT NOT FOR THE UGLY WOUND UPON
MY HAND ALL THAT HAD PASSED DURING THOSE DREADFUL HOURS MIGHT HAVE
BEEN AN EVIL DREAM
HALF DAZED I WENT INTO THE STATION AND ASKED ABOUT THE MORNING
TRAIN THERE WOULD BE ONE TO READING IN LESS THAN AN HOUR THE SAME
PORTER WAS ON DUTY I FOUND AS HAD BEEN THERE WHEN I ARRIVED I
INQUIRED OF HIM WHETHER HE HAD EVER HEARD OF COLONEL LYSANDER STARK
THE NAME WAS STRANGE TO HIM HAD HE OBSERVED A CARRIAGE THE NIGHT
BEFORE WAITING FOR ME NO HE HAD NOT WAS THERE A POLICESTATION
ANYWHERE NEAR THERE WAS ONE ABOUT THREE MILES OFF
IT WAS TOO FAR FOR ME TO GO WEAK AND ILL AS I WAS I DETERMINED TO
WAIT UNTIL I GOT BACK TO TOWN BEFORE TELLING MY STORY TO THE POLICE
IT WAS A LITTLE PAST SIX WHEN I ARRIVED SO I WENT FIRST TO HAVE MY
WOUND DRESSED AND THEN THE DOCTOR WAS KIND ENOUGH TO BRING ME ALONG
HERE I PUT THE CASE INTO YOUR HANDS AND SHALL DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU
ADVISE
WE BOTH SAT IN SILENCE FOR SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER LISTENING TO THIS
EXTRAORDINARY NARRATIVE THEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PULLED DOWN FROM THE
SHELF ONE OF THE PONDEROUS COMMONPLACE BOOKS IN WHICH HE PLACED HIS
CUTTINGS
HERE IS AN ADVERTISEMENT WHICH WILL INTEREST YOU SAID HE IT
APPEARED IN ALL THE PAPERS ABOUT A YEAR AGO LISTEN TO THIS
LOST ON THE TH INST MR JEREMIAH HAYLING AGED TWENTYSIX A
HYDRAULIC ENGINEER LEFT HIS LODGINGS AT TEN OCLOCK AT NIGHT AND
HAS NOT BEEN HEARD OF SINCE WAS DRESSED IN
ETC ETC HA THAT REPRESENTS THE LAST TIME THAT THE COLONEL NEEDED
TO HAVE HIS MACHINE OVERHAULED I FANCY
GOOD HEAVENS CRIED MY PATIENT THEN THAT EXPLAINS WHAT THE GIRL
SAID
UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THE COLONEL WAS A COOL AND
DESPERATE MAN WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED THAT NOTHING SHOULD
STAND IN THE WAY OF HIS LITTLE GAME LIKE THOSE OUTANDOUT PIRATES
WHO WILL LEAVE NO SURVIVOR FROM A CAPTURED SHIP WELL EVERY MOMENT
NOW IS PRECIOUS SO IF YOU FEEL EQUAL TO IT WE SHALL GO DOWN TO
SCOTLAND YARD AT ONCE AS A PRELIMINARY TO STARTING FOR EYFORD
SOME THREE HOURS OR SO AFTERWARDS WE WERE ALL IN THE TRAIN TOGETHER
BOUND FROM READING TO THE LITTLE BERKSHIRE VILLAGE THERE WERE
SHERLOCK HOLMES THE HYDRAULIC ENGINEER INSPECTOR BRADSTREET OF
SCOTLAND YARD A PLAINCLOTHES MAN AND MYSELF BRADSTREET HAD SPREAD
AN ORDNANCE MAP OF THE COUNTY OUT UPON THE SEAT AND WAS BUSY WITH HIS
COMPASSES DRAWING A CIRCLE WITH EYFORD FOR ITS CENTRE
THERE YOU ARE SAID HE THAT CIRCLE IS DRAWN AT A RADIUS OF TEN
MILES FROM THE VILLAGE THE PLACE WE WANT MUST BE SOMEWHERE NEAR THAT
LINE YOU SAID TEN MILES I THINK SIR
IT WAS AN HOURS GOOD DRIVE
AND YOU THINK THAT THEY BROUGHT YOU BACK ALL THAT WAY WHEN YOU WERE
UNCONSCIOUS
THEY MUST HAVE DONE SO I HAVE A CONFUSED MEMORY TOO OF HAVING
BEEN LIFTED AND CONVEYED SOMEWHERE
WHAT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND SAID I IS WHY THEY SHOULD HAVE SPARED
YOU WHEN THEY FOUND YOU LYING FAINTING IN THE GARDEN PERHAPS THE
VILLAIN WAS SOFTENED BY THE WOMANS ENTREATIES
I HARDLY THINK THAT LIKELY I NEVER SAW A MORE INEXORABLE FACE IN MY
LIFE
OH WE SHALL SOON CLEAR UP ALL THAT SAID BRADSTREET WELL I HAVE
DRAWN MY CIRCLE AND I ONLY WISH I KNEW AT WHAT POINT UPON IT THE
FOLK THAT WE ARE IN SEARCH OF ARE TO BE FOUND
I THINK I COULD LAY MY FINGER ON IT SAID HOLMES QUIETLY
REALLY NOW CRIED THE INSPECTOR YOU HAVE FORMED YOUR OPINION
COME NOW WE SHALL SEE WHO AGREES WITH YOU I SAY IT IS SOUTH FOR
THE COUNTRY IS MORE DESERTED THERE
AND I SAY EAST SAID MY PATIENT
I AM FOR WEST REMARKED THE PLAINCLOTHES MAN THERE ARE SEVERAL
QUIET LITTLE VILLAGES UP THERE
AND I AM FOR NORTH SAID I BECAUSE THERE ARE NO HILLS THERE AND
OUR FRIEND SAYS THAT HE DID NOT NOTICE THE CARRIAGE GO UP ANY
COME CRIED THE INSPECTOR LAUGHING ITS A VERY PRETTY DIVERSITY
OF OPINION WE HAVE BOXED THE COMPASS AMONG US WHO DO YOU GIVE YOUR
CASTING VOTE TO
YOU ARE ALL WRONG
BUT WE CANT ALL BE
OH YES YOU CAN THIS IS MY POINT HE PLACED HIS FINGER IN THE
CENTRE OF THE CIRCLE THIS IS WHERE WE SHALL FIND THEM
BUT THE TWELVEMILE DRIVE GASPED HATHERLEY
SIX OUT AND SIX BACK NOTHING SIMPLER YOU SAY YOURSELF THAT THE
HORSE WAS FRESH AND GLOSSY WHEN YOU GOT IN HOW COULD IT BE THAT IF
IT HAD GONE TWELVE MILES OVER HEAVY ROADS
INDEED IT IS A LIKELY RUSE ENOUGH OBSERVED BRADSTREET
THOUGHTFULLY OF COURSE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THE NATURE OF
THIS GANG
NONE AT ALL SAID HOLMES THEY ARE COINERS ON A LARGE SCALE AND
HAVE USED THE MACHINE TO FORM THE AMALGAM WHICH HAS TAKEN THE PLACE
OF SILVER
WE HAVE KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT A CLEVER GANG WAS AT WORK SAID
THE INSPECTOR THEY HAVE BEEN TURNING OUT HALFCROWNS BY THE
THOUSAND WE EVEN TRACED THEM AS FAR AS READING BUT COULD GET NO
FARTHER FOR THEY HAD COVERED THEIR TRACES IN A WAY THAT SHOWED THAT
THEY WERE VERY OLD HANDS BUT NOW THANKS TO THIS LUCKY CHANCE I
THINK THAT WE HAVE GOT THEM RIGHT ENOUGH
BUT THE INSPECTOR WAS MISTAKEN FOR THOSE CRIMINALS WERE NOT DESTINED
TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF JUSTICE AS WE ROLLED INTO EYFORD STATION
WE SAW A GIGANTIC COLUMN OF SMOKE WHICH STREAMED UP FROM BEHIND A
SMALL CLUMP OF TREES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND HUNG LIKE AN IMMENSE
OSTRICH FEATHER OVER THE LANDSCAPE
A HOUSE ON FIRE ASKED BRADSTREET AS THE TRAIN STEAMED OFF AGAIN ON
ITS WAY
YES SIR SAID THE STATIONMASTER
WHEN DID IT BREAK OUT
I HEAR THAT IT WAS DURING THE NIGHT SIR BUT IT HAS GOT WORSE AND
THE WHOLE PLACE IS IN A BLAZE
WHOSE HOUSE IS IT
DR BECHERS
TELL ME BROKE IN THE ENGINEER IS DR BECHER A GERMAN VERY THIN
WITH A LONG SHARP NOSE
THE STATIONMASTER LAUGHED HEARTILY NO SIR DR BECHER IS AN
ENGLISHMAN AND THERE ISNT A MAN IN THE PARISH WHO HAS A
BETTERLINED WAISTCOAT BUT HE HAS A GENTLEMAN STAYING WITH HIM A
PATIENT AS I UNDERSTAND WHO IS A FOREIGNER AND HE LOOKS AS IF A
LITTLE GOOD BERKSHIRE BEEF WOULD DO HIM NO HARM
THE STATIONMASTER HAD NOT FINISHED HIS SPEECH BEFORE WE WERE ALL
HASTENING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FIRE THE ROAD TOPPED A LOW HILL
AND THERE WAS A GREAT WIDESPREAD WHITEWASHED BUILDING IN FRONT OF US
SPOUTING FIRE AT EVERY CHINK AND WINDOW WHILE IN THE GARDEN IN FRONT
THREE FIREENGINES WERE VAINLY STRIVING TO KEEP THE FLAMES UNDER
THATS IT CRIED HATHERLEY IN INTENSE EXCITEMENT THERE IS THE
GRAVELDRIVE AND THERE ARE THE ROSEBUSHES WHERE I LAY THAT SECOND
WINDOW IS THE ONE THAT I JUMPED FROM
WELL AT LEAST SAID HOLMES YOU HAVE HAD YOUR REVENGE UPON THEM
THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION THAT IT WAS YOUR OILLAMP WHICH WHEN IT WAS
CRUSHED IN THE PRESS SET FIRE TO THE WOODEN WALLS THOUGH NO DOUBT
THEY WERE TOO EXCITED IN THE CHASE AFTER YOU TO OBSERVE IT AT THE
TIME NOW KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN IN THIS CROWD FOR YOUR FRIENDS OF LAST
NIGHT THOUGH I VERY MUCH FEAR THAT THEY ARE A GOOD HUNDRED MILES OFF
BY NOW
AND HOLMES FEARS CAME TO BE REALISED FOR FROM THAT DAY TO THIS NO
WORD HAS EVER BEEN HEARD EITHER OF THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN THE SINISTER
GERMAN OR THE MOROSE ENGLISHMAN EARLY THAT MORNING A PEASANT HAD
MET A CART CONTAINING SEVERAL PEOPLE AND SOME VERY BULKY BOXES
DRIVING RAPIDLY IN THE DIRECTION OF READING BUT THERE ALL TRACES OF
THE FUGITIVES DISAPPEARED AND EVEN HOLMES INGENUITY FAILED EVER TO
DISCOVER THE LEAST CLUE AS TO THEIR WHEREABOUTS
THE FIREMEN HAD BEEN MUCH PERTURBED AT THE STRANGE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH
THEY HAD FOUND WITHIN AND STILL MORE SO BY DISCOVERING A NEWLY
SEVERED HUMAN THUMB UPON A WINDOWSILL OF THE SECOND FLOOR ABOUT
SUNSET HOWEVER THEIR EFFORTS WERE AT LAST SUCCESSFUL AND THEY
SUBDUED THE FLAMES BUT NOT BEFORE THE ROOF HAD FALLEN IN AND THE
WHOLE PLACE BEEN REDUCED TO SUCH ABSOLUTE RUIN THAT SAVE SOME
TWISTED CYLINDERS AND IRON PIPING NOT A TRACE REMAINED OF THE
MACHINERY WHICH HAD COST OUR UNFORTUNATE ACQUAINTANCE SO DEARLY
LARGE MASSES OF NICKEL AND OF TIN WERE DISCOVERED STORED IN AN
OUTHOUSE BUT NO COINS WERE TO BE FOUND WHICH MAY HAVE EXPLAINED
THE PRESENCE OF THOSE BULKY BOXES WHICH HAVE BEEN ALREADY REFERRED
TO
HOW OUR HYDRAULIC ENGINEER HAD BEEN CONVEYED FROM THE GARDEN TO THE
SPOT WHERE HE RECOVERED HIS SENSES MIGHT HAVE REMAINED FOREVER A
MYSTERY WERE IT NOT FOR THE SOFT MOULD WHICH TOLD US A VERY PLAIN
TALE HE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN CARRIED DOWN BY TWO PERSONS ONE OF WHOM
HAD REMARKABLY SMALL FEET AND THE OTHER UNUSUALLY LARGE ONES ON THE
WHOLE IT WAS MOST PROBABLE THAT THE SILENT ENGLISHMAN BEING LESS
BOLD OR LESS MURDEROUS THAN HIS COMPANION HAD ASSISTED THE WOMAN TO
BEAR THE UNCONSCIOUS MAN OUT OF THE WAY OF DANGER
WELL SAID OUR ENGINEER RUEFULLY AS WE TOOK OUR SEATS TO RETURN
ONCE MORE TO LONDON IT HAS BEEN A PRETTY BUSINESS FOR ME I HAVE
LOST MY THUMB AND I HAVE LOST A FIFTYGUINEA FEE AND WHAT HAVE I
GAINED
EXPERIENCE SAID HOLMES LAUGHING INDIRECTLY IT MAY BE OF VALUE
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ONLY TO PUT IT INTO WORDS TO GAIN THE REPUTATION
OF BEING EXCELLENT COMPANY FOR THE REMAINDER OF YOUR EXISTENCE
THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
THE LORD ST SIMON MARRIAGE AND ITS CURIOUS TERMINATION HAVE LONG
CEASED TO BE A SUBJECT OF INTEREST IN THOSE EXALTED CIRCLES IN WHICH
THE UNFORTUNATE BRIDEGROOM MOVES FRESH SCANDALS HAVE ECLIPSED IT
AND THEIR MORE PIQUANT DETAILS HAVE DRAWN THE GOSSIPS AWAY FROM THIS
FOURYEAROLD DRAMA AS I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT THE
FULL FACTS HAVE NEVER BEEN REVEALED TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND AS MY
FRIEND SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD A CONSIDERABLE SHARE IN CLEARING THE
MATTER UP I FEEL THAT NO MEMOIR OF HIM WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT
SOME LITTLE SKETCH OF THIS REMARKABLE EPISODE
IT WAS A FEW WEEKS BEFORE MY OWN MARRIAGE DURING THE DAYS WHEN I WAS
STILL SHARING ROOMS WITH HOLMES IN BAKER STREET THAT HE CAME HOME
FROM AN AFTERNOON STROLL TO FIND A LETTER ON THE TABLE WAITING FOR
HIM I HAD REMAINED INDOORS ALL DAY FOR THE WEATHER HAD TAKEN A
SUDDEN TURN TO RAIN WITH HIGH AUTUMNAL WINDS AND THE JEZAIL BULLET
WHICH I HAD BROUGHT BACK IN ONE OF MY LIMBS AS A RELIC OF MY AFGHAN
CAMPAIGN THROBBED WITH DULL PERSISTENCE WITH MY BODY IN ONE
EASYCHAIR AND MY LEGS UPON ANOTHER I HAD SURROUNDED MYSELF WITH A
CLOUD OF NEWSPAPERS UNTIL AT LAST SATURATED WITH THE NEWS OF THE
DAY I TOSSED THEM ALL ASIDE AND LAY LISTLESS WATCHING THE HUGE
CREST AND MONOGRAM UPON THE ENVELOPE UPON THE TABLE AND WONDERING
LAZILY WHO MY FRIENDS NOBLE CORRESPONDENT COULD BE
HERE IS A VERY FASHIONABLE EPISTLE I REMARKED AS HE ENTERED YOUR
MORNING LETTERS IF I REMEMBER RIGHT WERE FROM A FISHMONGER AND A
TIDEWAITER
YES MY CORRESPONDENCE HAS CERTAINLY THE CHARM OF VARIETY HE
ANSWERED SMILING AND THE HUMBLER ARE USUALLY THE MORE INTERESTING
THIS LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE UNWELCOME SOCIAL SUMMONSES WHICH CALL
UPON A MAN EITHER TO BE BORED OR TO LIE
HE BROKE THE SEAL AND GLANCED OVER THE CONTENTS
OH COME IT MAY PROVE TO BE SOMETHING OF INTEREST AFTER ALL
NOT SOCIAL THEN
NO DISTINCTLY PROFESSIONAL
AND FROM A NOBLE CLIENT
ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN ENGLAND
MY DEAR FELLOW I CONGRATULATE YOU
I ASSURE YOU WATSON WITHOUT AFFECTATION THAT THE STATUS OF MY
CLIENT IS A MATTER OF LESS MOMENT TO ME THAN THE INTEREST OF HIS
CASE IT IS JUST POSSIBLE HOWEVER THAT THAT ALSO MAY NOT BE WANTING
IN THIS NEW INVESTIGATION YOU HAVE BEEN READING THE PAPERS
DILIGENTLY OF LATE HAVE YOU NOT
IT LOOKS LIKE IT SAID I RUEFULLY POINTING TO A HUGE BUNDLE IN THE
CORNER I HAVE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO
IT IS FORTUNATE FOR YOU WILL PERHAPS BE ABLE TO POST ME UP I READ
NOTHING EXCEPT THE CRIMINAL NEWS AND THE AGONY COLUMN THE LATTER IS
ALWAYS INSTRUCTIVE BUT IF YOU HAVE FOLLOWED RECENT EVENTS SO CLOSELY
YOU MUST HAVE READ ABOUT LORD ST SIMON AND HIS WEDDING
OH YES WITH THE DEEPEST INTEREST
THAT IS WELL THE LETTER WHICH I HOLD IN MY HAND IS FROM LORD ST
SIMON I WILL READ IT TO YOU AND IN RETURN YOU MUST TURN OVER THESE
PAPERS AND LET ME HAVE WHATEVER BEARS UPON THE MATTER THIS IS WHAT
HE SAYS
MY DEAR MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
LORD BACKWATER TELLS ME THAT I MAY PLACE IMPLICIT RELIANCE UPON
YOUR JUDGMENT AND DISCRETION I HAVE DETERMINED THEREFORE TO CALL
UPON YOU AND TO CONSULT YOU IN REFERENCE TO THE VERY PAINFUL EVENT
WHICH HAS OCCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH MY WEDDING MR LESTRADE OF
SCOTLAND YARD IS ACTING ALREADY IN THE MATTER BUT HE ASSURES ME
THAT HE SEES NO OBJECTION TO YOUR COOPERATION AND THAT HE EVEN
THINKS THAT IT MIGHT BE OF SOME ASSISTANCE I WILL CALL AT FOUR
OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ENGAGEMENT
AT THAT TIME I HOPE THAT YOU WILL POSTPONE IT AS THIS MATTER IS OF
PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE
YOURS FAITHFULLY
ST SIMON
IT IS DATED FROM GROSVENOR MANSIONS WRITTEN WITH A QUILL PEN AND
THE NOBLE LORD HAS HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO GET A SMEAR OF INK UPON THE
OUTER SIDE OF HIS RIGHT LITTLE FINGER REMARKED HOLMES AS HE FOLDED
UP THE EPISTLE
HE SAYS FOUR OCLOCK IT IS THREE NOW HE WILL BE HERE IN AN HOUR
THEN I HAVE JUST TIME WITH YOUR ASSISTANCE TO GET CLEAR UPON THE
SUBJECT TURN OVER THOSE PAPERS AND ARRANGE THE EXTRACTS IN THEIR
ORDER OF TIME WHILE I TAKE A GLANCE AS TO WHO OUR CLIENT IS HE
PICKED A REDCOVERED VOLUME FROM A LINE OF BOOKS OF REFERENCE BESIDE
THE MANTELPIECE HERE HE IS SAID HE SITTING DOWN AND FLATTENING
IT OUT UPON HIS KNEE LORD ROBERT WALSINGHAM DE VERE ST SIMON
SECOND SON OF THE DUKE OF BALMORAL HUM ARMS AZURE THREE
CALTROPS IN CHIEF OVER A FESS SABLE BORN IN HES FORTYONE
YEARS OF AGE WHICH IS MATURE FOR MARRIAGE WAS UNDERSECRETARY FOR
THE COLONIES IN A LATE ADMINISTRATION THE DUKE HIS FATHER WAS AT
ONE TIME SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS THEY INHERIT PLANTAGENET
BLOOD BY DIRECT DESCENT AND TUDOR ON THE DISTAFF SIDE HA WELL
THERE IS NOTHING VERY INSTRUCTIVE IN ALL THIS I THINK THAT I MUST
TURN TO YOU WATSON FOR SOMETHING MORE SOLID
I HAVE VERY LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING WHAT I WANT SAID I FOR
THE FACTS ARE QUITE RECENT AND THE MATTER STRUCK ME AS REMARKABLE I
FEARED TO REFER THEM TO YOU HOWEVER AS I KNEW THAT YOU HAD AN
INQUIRY ON HAND AND THAT YOU DISLIKED THE INTRUSION OF OTHER
MATTERS
OH YOU MEAN THE LITTLE PROBLEM OF THE GROSVENOR SQUARE FURNITURE
VAN THAT IS QUITE CLEARED UP NOWTHOUGH INDEED IT WAS OBVIOUS
FROM THE FIRST PRAY GIVE ME THE RESULTS OF YOUR NEWSPAPER
SELECTIONS
HERE IS THE FIRST NOTICE WHICH I CAN FIND IT IS IN THE PERSONAL
COLUMN OF THE MORNING POST AND DATES AS YOU SEE SOME WEEKS BACK
A MARRIAGE HAS BEEN ARRANGED IT SAYS AND WILL IF RUMOUR IS
CORRECT VERY SHORTLY TAKE PLACE BETWEEN LORD ROBERT ST SIMON
SECOND SON OF THE DUKE OF BALMORAL AND MISS HATTY DORAN THE ONLY
DAUGHTER OF ALOYSIUS DORAN ESQ OF SAN FRANCISCO CAL USA
THAT IS ALL
TERSE AND TO THE POINT REMARKED HOLMES STRETCHING HIS LONG THIN
LEGS TOWARDS THE FIRE
THERE WAS A PARAGRAPH AMPLIFYING THIS IN ONE OF THE SOCIETY PAPERS
OF THE SAME WEEK AH HERE IT IS
THERE WILL SOON BE A CALL FOR PROTECTION IN THE MARRIAGE MARKET
FOR THE PRESENT FREETRADE PRINCIPLE APPEARS TO TELL HEAVILY AGAINST
OUR HOME PRODUCT ONE BY ONE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE NOBLE HOUSES OF
GREAT BRITAIN IS PASSING INTO THE HANDS OF OUR FAIR COUSINS FROM
ACROSS THE ATLANTIC AN IMPORTANT ADDITION HAS BEEN MADE DURING THE
LAST WEEK TO THE LIST OF THE PRIZES WHICH HAVE BEEN BORNE AWAY BY
THESE CHARMING INVADERS LORD ST SIMON WHO HAS SHOWN HIMSELF FOR
OVER TWENTY YEARS PROOF AGAINST THE LITTLE GODS ARROWS HAS NOW
DEFINITELY ANNOUNCED HIS APPROACHING MARRIAGE WITH MISS HATTY DORAN
THE FASCINATING DAUGHTER OF A CALIFORNIA MILLIONAIRE MISS DORAN
WHOSE GRACEFUL FIGURE AND STRIKING FACE ATTRACTED MUCH ATTENTION AT
THE WESTBURY HOUSE FESTIVITIES IS AN ONLY CHILD AND IT IS CURRENTLY
REPORTED THAT HER DOWRY WILL RUN TO CONSIDERABLY OVER THE SIX
FIGURES WITH EXPECTANCIES FOR THE FUTURE AS IT IS AN OPEN SECRET
THAT THE DUKE OF BALMORAL HAS BEEN COMPELLED TO SELL HIS PICTURES
WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND AS LORD ST SIMON HAS NO PROPERTY OF
HIS OWN SAVE THE SMALL ESTATE OF BIRCHMOOR IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE
CALIFORNIAN HEIRESS IS NOT THE ONLY GAINER BY AN ALLIANCE WHICH WILL
ENABLE HER TO MAKE THE EASY AND COMMON TRANSITION FROM A REPUBLICAN
LADY TO A BRITISH PEERESS
ANYTHING ELSE ASKED HOLMES YAWNING
OH YES PLENTY THEN THERE IS ANOTHER NOTE IN THE MORNING POST TO
SAY THAT THE MARRIAGE WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTELY QUIET ONE THAT IT WOULD
BE AT ST GEORGES HANOVER SQUARE THAT ONLY HALF A DOZEN INTIMATE
FRIENDS WOULD BE INVITED AND THAT THE PARTY WOULD RETURN TO THE
FURNISHED HOUSE AT LANCASTER GATE WHICH HAS BEEN TAKEN BY MR
ALOYSIUS DORAN TWO DAYS LATERTHAT IS ON WEDNESDAY LASTTHERE IS
A CURT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE WEDDING HAD TAKEN PLACE AND THAT THE
HONEYMOON WOULD BE PASSED AT LORD BACKWATERS PLACE NEAR
PETERSFIELD THOSE ARE ALL THE NOTICES WHICH APPEARED BEFORE THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF THE BRIDE
BEFORE THE WHAT ASKED HOLMES WITH A START
THE VANISHING OF THE LADY
WHEN DID SHE VANISH THEN
AT THE WEDDING BREAKFAST
INDEED THIS IS MORE INTERESTING THAN IT PROMISED TO BE QUITE
DRAMATIC IN FACT
YES IT STRUCK ME AS BEING A LITTLE OUT OF THE COMMON
THEY OFTEN VANISH BEFORE THE CEREMONY AND OCCASIONALLY DURING THE
HONEYMOON BUT I CANNOT CALL TO MIND ANYTHING QUITE SO PROMPT AS
THIS PRAY LET ME HAVE THE DETAILS
I WARN YOU THAT THEY ARE VERY INCOMPLETE
PERHAPS WE MAY MAKE THEM LESS SO
SUCH AS THEY ARE THEY ARE SET FORTH IN A SINGLE ARTICLE OF A
MORNING PAPER OF YESTERDAY WHICH I WILL READ TO YOU IT IS HEADED
SINGULAR OCCURRENCE AT A FASHIONABLE WEDDING
THE FAMILY OF LORD ROBERT ST SIMON HAS BEEN THROWN INTO THE
GREATEST CONSTERNATION BY THE STRANGE AND PAINFUL EPISODES WHICH HAVE
TAKEN PLACE IN CONNECTION WITH HIS WEDDING THE CEREMONY AS SHORTLY
ANNOUNCED IN THE PAPERS OF YESTERDAY OCCURRED ON THE PREVIOUS
MORNING BUT IT IS ONLY NOW THAT IT HAS BEEN POSSIBLE TO CONFIRM THE
STRANGE RUMOURS WHICH HAVE BEEN SO PERSISTENTLY FLOATING ABOUT IN
SPITE OF THE ATTEMPTS OF THE FRIENDS TO HUSH THE MATTER UP SO MUCH
PUBLIC ATTENTION HAS NOW BEEN DRAWN TO IT THAT NO GOOD PURPOSE CAN BE
SERVED BY AFFECTING TO DISREGARD WHAT IS A COMMON SUBJECT FOR
CONVERSATION
THE CEREMONY WHICH WAS PERFORMED AT ST GEORGES HANOVER SQUARE
WAS A VERY QUIET ONE NO ONE BEING PRESENT SAVE THE FATHER OF THE
BRIDE MR ALOYSIUS DORAN THE DUCHESS OF BALMORAL LORD BACKWATER
LORD EUSTACE AND LADY CLARA ST SIMON THE YOUNGER BROTHER AND SISTER
OF THE BRIDEGROOM AND LADY ALICIA WHITTINGTON THE WHOLE PARTY
PROCEEDED AFTERWARDS TO THE HOUSE OF MR ALOYSIUS DORAN AT LANCASTER
GATE WHERE BREAKFAST HAD BEEN PREPARED IT APPEARS THAT SOME LITTLE
TROUBLE WAS CAUSED BY A WOMAN WHOSE NAME HAS NOT BEEN ASCERTAINED
WHO ENDEAVOURED TO FORCE HER WAY INTO THE HOUSE AFTER THE BRIDAL
PARTY ALLEGING THAT SHE HAD SOME CLAIM UPON LORD ST SIMON IT WAS
ONLY AFTER A PAINFUL AND PROLONGED SCENE THAT SHE WAS EJECTED BY THE
BUTLER AND THE FOOTMAN THE BRIDE WHO HAD FORTUNATELY ENTERED THE
HOUSE BEFORE THIS UNPLEASANT INTERRUPTION HAD SAT DOWN TO BREAKFAST
WITH THE REST WHEN SHE COMPLAINED OF A SUDDEN INDISPOSITION AND
RETIRED TO HER ROOM HER PROLONGED ABSENCE HAVING CAUSED SOME
COMMENT HER FATHER FOLLOWED HER BUT LEARNED FROM HER MAID THAT SHE
HAD ONLY COME UP TO HER CHAMBER FOR AN INSTANT CAUGHT UP AN ULSTER
AND BONNET AND HURRIED DOWN TO THE PASSAGE ONE OF THE FOOTMEN
DECLARED THAT HE HAD SEEN A LADY LEAVE THE HOUSE THUS APPARELLED BUT
HAD REFUSED TO CREDIT THAT IT WAS HIS MISTRESS BELIEVING HER TO BE
WITH THE COMPANY ON ASCERTAINING THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAD DISAPPEARED
MR ALOYSIUS DORAN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BRIDEGROOM INSTANTLY PUT
THEMSELVES IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE POLICE AND VERY ENERGETIC
INQUIRIES ARE BEING MADE WHICH WILL PROBABLY RESULT IN A SPEEDY
CLEARING UP OF THIS VERY SINGULAR BUSINESS UP TO A LATE HOUR LAST
NIGHT HOWEVER NOTHING HAD TRANSPIRED AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE
MISSING LADY THERE ARE RUMOURS OF FOUL PLAY IN THE MATTER AND IT IS
SAID THAT THE POLICE HAVE CAUSED THE ARREST OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD
CAUSED THE ORIGINAL DISTURBANCE IN THE BELIEF THAT FROM JEALOUSY OR
SOME OTHER MOTIVE SHE MAY HAVE BEEN CONCERNED IN THE STRANGE
DISAPPEARANCE OF THE BRIDE
AND IS THAT ALL
ONLY ONE LITTLE ITEM IN ANOTHER OF THE MORNING PAPERS BUT IT IS A
SUGGESTIVE ONE
AND IT IS
THAT MISS FLORA MILLAR THE LADY WHO HAD CAUSED THE DISTURBANCE HAS
ACTUALLY BEEN ARRESTED IT APPEARS THAT SHE WAS FORMERLY A DANSEUSE
AT THE ALLEGRO AND THAT SHE HAS KNOWN THE BRIDEGROOM FOR SOME YEARS
THERE ARE NO FURTHER PARTICULARS AND THE WHOLE CASE IS IN YOUR HANDS
NOWSO FAR AS IT HAS BEEN SET FORTH IN THE PUBLIC PRESS
AND AN EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING CASE IT APPEARS TO BE I WOULD NOT
HAVE MISSED IT FOR WORLDS BUT THERE IS A RING AT THE BELL WATSON
AND AS THE CLOCK MAKES IT A FEW MINUTES AFTER FOUR I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT THIS WILL PROVE TO BE OUR NOBLE CLIENT DO NOT DREAM OF GOING
WATSON FOR I VERY MUCH PREFER HAVING A WITNESS IF ONLY AS A CHECK
TO MY OWN MEMORY
LORD ROBERT ST SIMON ANNOUNCED OUR PAGEBOY THROWING OPEN THE
DOOR A GENTLEMAN ENTERED WITH A PLEASANT CULTURED FACE HIGHNOSED
AND PALE WITH SOMETHING PERHAPS OF PETULANCE ABOUT THE MOUTH AND
WITH THE STEADY WELLOPENED EYE OF A MAN WHOSE PLEASANT LOT IT HAD
EVER BEEN TO COMMAND AND TO BE OBEYED HIS MANNER WAS BRISK AND YET
HIS GENERAL APPEARANCE GAVE AN UNDUE IMPRESSION OF AGE FOR HE HAD A
SLIGHT FORWARD STOOP AND A LITTLE BEND OF THE KNEES AS HE WALKED HIS
HAIR TOO AS HE SWEPT OFF HIS VERY CURLYBRIMMED HAT WAS GRIZZLED
ROUND THE EDGES AND THIN UPON THE TOP AS TO HIS DRESS IT WAS
CAREFUL TO THE VERGE OF FOPPISHNESS WITH HIGH COLLAR BLACK
FROCKCOAT WHITE WAISTCOAT YELLOW GLOVES PATENTLEATHER SHOES AND
LIGHTCOLOURED GAITERS HE ADVANCED SLOWLY INTO THE ROOM TURNING HIS
HEAD FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AND SWINGING IN HIS RIGHT HAND THE CORD
WHICH HELD HIS GOLDEN EYEGLASSES
GOODDAY LORD ST SIMON SAID HOLMES RISING AND BOWING PRAY
TAKE THE BASKETCHAIR THIS IS MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE DR WATSON
DRAW UP A LITTLE TO THE FIRE AND WE WILL TALK THIS MATTER OVER
A MOST PAINFUL MATTER TO ME AS YOU CAN MOST READILY IMAGINE MR
HOLMES I HAVE BEEN CUT TO THE QUICK I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE
ALREADY MANAGED SEVERAL DELICATE CASES OF THIS SORT SIR THOUGH I
PRESUME THAT THEY WERE HARDLY FROM THE SAME CLASS OF SOCIETY
NO I AM DESCENDING
I BEG PARDON
MY LAST CLIENT OF THE SORT WAS A KING
OH REALLY I HAD NO IDEA AND WHICH KING
THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA
WHAT HAD HE LOST HIS WIFE
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND SAID HOLMES SUAVELY THAT I EXTEND TO THE
AFFAIRS OF MY OTHER CLIENTS THE SAME SECRECY WHICH I PROMISE TO YOU
IN YOURS
OF COURSE VERY RIGHT VERY RIGHT IM SURE I BEG PARDON AS TO MY
OWN CASE I AM READY TO GIVE YOU ANY INFORMATION WHICH MAY ASSIST YOU
IN FORMING AN OPINION
THANK YOU I HAVE ALREADY LEARNED ALL THAT IS IN THE PUBLIC PRINTS
NOTHING MORE I PRESUME THAT I MAY TAKE IT AS CORRECTTHIS ARTICLE
FOR EXAMPLE AS TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE BRIDE
LORD ST SIMON GLANCED OVER IT YES IT IS CORRECT AS FAR AS IT
GOES
BUT IT NEEDS A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPLEMENTING BEFORE ANYONE COULD OFFER
AN OPINION I THINK THAT I MAY ARRIVE AT MY FACTS MOST DIRECTLY BY
QUESTIONING YOU
PRAY DO SO
WHEN DID YOU FIRST MEET MISS HATTY DORAN
IN SAN FRANCISCO A YEAR AGO
YOU WERE TRAVELLING IN THE STATES
YES
DID YOU BECOME ENGAGED THEN
NO
BUT YOU WERE ON A FRIENDLY FOOTING
I WAS AMUSED BY HER SOCIETY AND SHE COULD SEE THAT I WAS AMUSED
HER FATHER IS VERY RICH
HE IS SAID TO BE THE RICHEST MAN ON THE PACIFIC SLOPE
AND HOW DID HE MAKE HIS MONEY
IN MINING HE HAD NOTHING A FEW YEARS AGO THEN HE STRUCK GOLD
INVESTED IT AND CAME UP BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS
NOW WHAT IS YOUR OWN IMPRESSION AS TO THE YOUNG LADYSYOUR WIFES
CHARACTER
THE NOBLEMAN SWUNG HIS GLASSES A LITTLE FASTER AND STARED DOWN INTO
THE FIRE YOU SEE MR HOLMES SAID HE MY WIFE WAS TWENTY BEFORE
HER FATHER BECAME A RICH MAN DURING THAT TIME SHE RAN FREE IN A
MINING CAMP AND WANDERED THROUGH WOODS OR MOUNTAINS SO THAT HER
EDUCATION HAS COME FROM NATURE RATHER THAN FROM THE SCHOOLMASTER SHE
IS WHAT WE CALL IN ENGLAND A TOMBOY WITH A STRONG NATURE WILD AND
FREE UNFETTERED BY ANY SORT OF TRADITIONS SHE IS
IMPETUOUSVOLCANIC I WAS ABOUT TO SAY SHE IS SWIFT IN MAKING UP
HER MIND AND FEARLESS IN CARRYING OUT HER RESOLUTIONS ON THE OTHER
HAND I WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN HER THE NAME WHICH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO
BEARHE GAVE A LITTLE STATELY COUGHHAD NOT I THOUGHT HER TO BE
AT BOTTOM A NOBLE WOMAN I BELIEVE THAT SHE IS CAPABLE OF HEROIC
SELFSACRIFICE AND THAT ANYTHING DISHONOURABLE WOULD BE REPUGNANT TO
HER
HAVE YOU HER PHOTOGRAPH
I BROUGHT THIS WITH ME HE OPENED A LOCKET AND SHOWED US THE FULL
FACE OF A VERY LOVELY WOMAN IT WAS NOT A PHOTOGRAPH BUT AN IVORY
MINIATURE AND THE ARTIST HAD BROUGHT OUT THE FULL EFFECT OF THE
LUSTROUS BLACK HAIR THE LARGE DARK EYES AND THE EXQUISITE MOUTH
HOLMES GAZED LONG AND EARNESTLY AT IT THEN HE CLOSED THE LOCKET AND
HANDED IT BACK TO LORD ST SIMON
THE YOUNG LADY CAME TO LONDON THEN AND YOU RENEWED YOUR
ACQUAINTANCE
YES HER FATHER BROUGHT HER OVER FOR THIS LAST LONDON SEASON I MET
HER SEVERAL TIMES BECAME ENGAGED TO HER AND HAVE NOW MARRIED HER
SHE BROUGHT I UNDERSTAND A CONSIDERABLE DOWRY
A FAIR DOWRY NOT MORE THAN IS USUAL IN MY FAMILY
AND THIS OF COURSE REMAINS TO YOU SINCE THE MARRIAGE IS A FAIT
ACCOMPLI
I REALLY HAVE MADE NO INQUIRIES ON THE SUBJECT
VERY NATURALLY NOT DID YOU SEE MISS DORAN ON THE DAY BEFORE THE
WEDDING
YES
WAS SHE IN GOOD SPIRITS
NEVER BETTER SHE KEPT TALKING OF WHAT WE SHOULD DO IN OUR FUTURE
LIVES
INDEED THAT IS VERY INTERESTING AND ON THE MORNING OF THE
WEDDING
SHE WAS AS BRIGHT AS POSSIBLEAT LEAST UNTIL AFTER THE CEREMONY
AND DID YOU OBSERVE ANY CHANGE IN HER THEN
WELL TO TELL THE TRUTH I SAW THEN THE FIRST SIGNS THAT I HAD EVER
SEEN THAT HER TEMPER WAS JUST A LITTLE SHARP THE INCIDENT HOWEVER
WAS TOO TRIVIAL TO RELATE AND CAN HAVE NO POSSIBLE BEARING UPON THE
CASE
PRAY LET US HAVE IT FOR ALL THAT
OH IT IS CHILDISH SHE DROPPED HER BOUQUET AS WE WENT TOWARDS THE
VESTRY SHE WAS PASSING THE FRONT PEW AT THE TIME AND IT FELL OVER
INTO THE PEW THERE WAS A MOMENTS DELAY BUT THE GENTLEMAN IN THE
PEW HANDED IT UP TO HER AGAIN AND IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE THE WORSE
FOR THE FALL YET WHEN I SPOKE TO HER OF THE MATTER SHE ANSWERED ME
ABRUPTLY AND IN THE CARRIAGE ON OUR WAY HOME SHE SEEMED ABSURDLY
AGITATED OVER THIS TRIFLING CAUSE
INDEED YOU SAY THAT THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN IN THE PEW SOME OF THE
GENERAL PUBLIC WERE PRESENT THEN
OH YES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXCLUDE THEM WHEN THE CHURCH IS OPEN
THIS GENTLEMAN WAS NOT ONE OF YOUR WIFES FRIENDS
NO NO I CALL HIM A GENTLEMAN BY COURTESY BUT HE WAS QUITE A
COMMONLOOKING PERSON I HARDLY NOTICED HIS APPEARANCE BUT REALLY I
THINK THAT WE ARE WANDERING RATHER FAR FROM THE POINT
LADY ST SIMON THEN RETURNED FROM THE WEDDING IN A LESS CHEERFUL
FRAME OF MIND THAN SHE HAD GONE TO IT WHAT DID SHE DO ON REENTERING
HER FATHERS HOUSE
I SAW HER IN CONVERSATION WITH HER MAID
AND WHO IS HER MAID
ALICE IS HER NAME SHE IS AN AMERICAN AND CAME FROM CALIFORNIA WITH
HER
A CONFIDENTIAL SERVANT
A LITTLE TOO MUCH SO IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HER MISTRESS ALLOWED HER
TO TAKE GREAT LIBERTIES STILL OF COURSE IN AMERICA THEY LOOK UPON
THESE THINGS IN A DIFFERENT WAY
HOW LONG DID SHE SPEAK TO THIS ALICE
OH A FEW MINUTES I HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK OF
YOU DID NOT OVERHEAR WHAT THEY SAID
LADY ST SIMON SAID SOMETHING ABOUT JUMPING A CLAIM SHE WAS
ACCUSTOMED TO USE SLANG OF THE KIND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SHE MEANT
AMERICAN SLANG IS VERY EXPRESSIVE SOMETIMES AND WHAT DID YOUR WIFE
DO WHEN SHE FINISHED SPEAKING TO HER MAID
SHE WALKED INTO THE BREAKFASTROOM
ON YOUR ARM
NO ALONE SHE WAS VERY INDEPENDENT IN LITTLE MATTERS LIKE THAT
THEN AFTER WE HAD SAT DOWN FOR TEN MINUTES OR SO SHE ROSE
HURRIEDLY MUTTERED SOME WORDS OF APOLOGY AND LEFT THE ROOM SHE
NEVER CAME BACK
BUT THIS MAID ALICE AS I UNDERSTAND DEPOSES THAT SHE WENT TO HER
ROOM COVERED HER BRIDES DRESS WITH A LONG ULSTER PUT ON A BONNET
AND WENT OUT
QUITE SO AND SHE WAS AFTERWARDS SEEN WALKING INTO HYDE PARK IN
COMPANY WITH FLORA MILLAR A WOMAN WHO IS NOW IN CUSTODY AND WHO HAD
ALREADY MADE A DISTURBANCE AT MR DORANS HOUSE THAT MORNING
AH YES I SHOULD LIKE A FEW PARTICULARS AS TO THIS YOUNG LADY AND
YOUR RELATIONS TO HER
LORD ST SIMON SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND RAISED HIS EYEBROWS WE
HAVE BEEN ON A FRIENDLY FOOTING FOR SOME YEARSI MAY SAY ON A VERY
FRIENDLY FOOTING SHE USED TO BE AT THE ALLEGRO I HAVE NOT TREATED
HER UNGENEROUSLY AND SHE HAD NO JUST CAUSE OF COMPLAINT AGAINST ME
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WOMEN ARE MR HOLMES FLORA WAS A DEAR LITTLE
THING BUT EXCEEDINGLY HOTHEADED AND DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO ME SHE
WROTE ME DREADFUL LETTERS WHEN SHE HEARD THAT I WAS ABOUT TO BE
MARRIED AND TO TELL THE TRUTH THE REASON WHY I HAD THE MARRIAGE
CELEBRATED SO QUIETLY WAS THAT I FEARED LEST THERE MIGHT BE A SCANDAL
IN THE CHURCH SHE CAME TO MR DORANS DOOR JUST AFTER WE RETURNED
AND SHE ENDEAVOURED TO PUSH HER WAY IN UTTERING VERY ABUSIVE
EXPRESSIONS TOWARDS MY WIFE AND EVEN THREATENING HER BUT I HAD
FORESEEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SOMETHING OF THE SORT AND I HAD TWO
POLICE FELLOWS THERE IN PRIVATE CLOTHES WHO SOON PUSHED HER OUT
AGAIN SHE WAS QUIET WHEN SHE SAW THAT THERE WAS NO GOOD IN MAKING A
ROW
DID YOUR WIFE HEAR ALL THIS
NO THANK GOODNESS SHE DID NOT
AND SHE WAS SEEN WALKING WITH THIS VERY WOMAN AFTERWARDS
YES THAT IS WHAT MR LESTRADE OF SCOTLAND YARD LOOKS UPON AS SO
SERIOUS IT IS THOUGHT THAT FLORA DECOYED MY WIFE OUT AND LAID SOME
TERRIBLE TRAP FOR HER
WELL IT IS A POSSIBLE SUPPOSITION
YOU THINK SO TOO
I DID NOT SAY A PROBABLE ONE BUT YOU DO NOT YOURSELF LOOK UPON THIS
AS LIKELY
I DO NOT THINK FLORA WOULD HURT A FLY
STILL JEALOUSY IS A STRANGE TRANSFORMER OF CHARACTERS PRAY WHAT IS
YOUR OWN THEORY AS TO WHAT TOOK PLACE
WELL REALLY I CAME TO SEEK A THEORY NOT TO PROPOUND ONE I HAVE
GIVEN YOU ALL THE FACTS SINCE YOU ASK ME HOWEVER I MAY SAY THAT IT
HAS OCCURRED TO ME AS POSSIBLE THAT THE EXCITEMENT OF THIS AFFAIR
THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE HAD MADE SO IMMENSE A SOCIAL STRIDE HAD
THE EFFECT OF CAUSING SOME LITTLE NERVOUS DISTURBANCE IN MY WIFE
IN SHORT THAT SHE HAD BECOME SUDDENLY DERANGED
WELL REALLY WHEN I CONSIDER THAT SHE HAS TURNED HER BACKI WILL
NOT SAY UPON ME BUT UPON SO MUCH THAT MANY HAVE ASPIRED TO WITHOUT
SUCCESSI CAN HARDLY EXPLAIN IT IN ANY OTHER FASHION
WELL CERTAINLY THAT IS ALSO A CONCEIVABLE HYPOTHESIS SAID HOLMES
SMILING AND NOW LORD ST SIMON I THINK THAT I HAVE NEARLY ALL MY
DATA MAY I ASK WHETHER YOU WERE SEATED AT THE BREAKFASTTABLE SO
THAT YOU COULD SEE OUT OF THE WINDOW
WE COULD SEE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THE PARK
QUITE SO THEN I DO NOT THINK THAT I NEED TO DETAIN YOU LONGER I
SHALL COMMUNICATE WITH YOU
SHOULD YOU BE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM SAID OUR
CLIENT RISING
I HAVE SOLVED IT
EH WHAT WAS THAT
I SAY THAT I HAVE SOLVED IT
WHERE THEN IS MY WIFE
THAT IS A DETAIL WHICH I SHALL SPEEDILY SUPPLY
LORD ST SIMON SHOOK HIS HEAD I AM AFRAID THAT IT WILL TAKE WISER
HEADS THAN YOURS OR MINE HE REMARKED AND BOWING IN A STATELY
OLDFASHIONED MANNER HE DEPARTED
IT IS VERY GOOD OF LORD ST SIMON TO HONOUR MY HEAD BY PUTTING IT ON
A LEVEL WITH HIS OWN SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES LAUGHING I THINK THAT
I SHALL HAVE A WHISKY AND SODA AND A CIGAR AFTER ALL THIS
CROSSQUESTIONING I HAD FORMED MY CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE CASE BEFORE
OUR CLIENT CAME INTO THE ROOM
MY DEAR HOLMES
I HAVE NOTES OF SEVERAL SIMILAR CASES THOUGH NONE AS I REMARKED
BEFORE WHICH WERE QUITE AS PROMPT MY WHOLE EXAMINATION SERVED TO
TURN MY CONJECTURE INTO A CERTAINTY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IS
OCCASIONALLY VERY CONVINCING AS WHEN YOU FIND A TROUT IN THE MILK
TO QUOTE THOREAUS EXAMPLE
BUT I HAVE HEARD ALL THAT YOU HAVE HEARD
WITHOUT HOWEVER THE KNOWLEDGE OF PREEXISTING CASES WHICH SERVES
ME SO WELL THERE WAS A PARALLEL INSTANCE IN ABERDEEN SOME YEARS
BACK AND SOMETHING ON VERY MUCH THE SAME LINES AT MUNICH THE YEAR
AFTER THE FRANCOPRUSSIAN WAR IT IS ONE OF THESE CASESBUT HULLO
HERE IS LESTRADE GOODAFTERNOON LESTRADE YOU WILL FIND AN EXTRA
TUMBLER UPON THE SIDEBOARD AND THERE ARE CIGARS IN THE BOX
THE OFFICIAL DETECTIVE WAS ATTIRED IN A PEAJACKET AND CRAVAT WHICH
GAVE HIM A DECIDEDLY NAUTICAL APPEARANCE AND HE CARRIED A BLACK
CANVAS BAG IN HIS HAND WITH A SHORT GREETING HE SEATED HIMSELF AND
LIT THE CIGAR WHICH HAD BEEN OFFERED TO HIM
WHATS UP THEN ASKED HOLMES WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE YOU LOOK
DISSATISFIED
AND I FEEL DISSATISFIED IT IS THIS INFERNAL ST SIMON MARRIAGE
CASE I CAN MAKE NEITHER HEAD NOR TAIL OF THE BUSINESS
REALLY YOU SURPRISE ME
WHO EVER HEARD OF SUCH A MIXED AFFAIR EVERY CLUE SEEMS TO SLIP
THROUGH MY FINGERS I HAVE BEEN AT WORK UPON IT ALL DAY
AND VERY WET IT SEEMS TO HAVE MADE YOU SAID HOLMES LAYING HIS HAND
UPON THE ARM OF THE PEAJACKET
YES I HAVE BEEN DRAGGING THE SERPENTINE
IN HEAVENS NAME WHAT FOR
IN SEARCH OF THE BODY OF LADY ST SIMON
SHERLOCK HOLMES LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND LAUGHED HEARTILY
HAVE YOU DRAGGED THE BASIN OF TRAFALGAR SQUARE FOUNTAIN HE ASKED
WHY WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BECAUSE YOU HAVE JUST AS GOOD A CHANCE OF FINDING THIS LADY IN THE
ONE AS IN THE OTHER
LESTRADE SHOT AN ANGRY GLANCE AT MY COMPANION I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW
ALL ABOUT IT HE SNARLED
WELL I HAVE ONLY JUST HEARD THE FACTS BUT MY MIND IS MADE UP
OH INDEED THEN YOU THINK THAT THE SERPENTINE PLAYS NO PART IN THE
MATTER
I THINK IT VERY UNLIKELY
THEN PERHAPS YOU WILL KINDLY EXPLAIN HOW IT IS THAT WE FOUND THIS IN
IT HE OPENED HIS BAG AS HE SPOKE AND TUMBLED ONTO THE FLOOR A
WEDDINGDRESS OF WATERED SILK A PAIR OF WHITE SATIN SHOES AND A
BRIDES WREATH AND VEIL ALL DISCOLOURED AND SOAKED IN WATER
THERE SAID HE PUTTING A NEW WEDDINGRING UPON THE TOP OF THE
PILE THERE IS A LITTLE NUT FOR YOU TO CRACK MASTER HOLMES
OH INDEED SAID MY FRIEND BLOWING BLUE RINGS INTO THE AIR YOU
DRAGGED THEM FROM THE SERPENTINE
NO THEY WERE FOUND FLOATING NEAR THE MARGIN BY A PARKKEEPER THEY
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HER CLOTHES AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IF THE
CLOTHES WERE THERE THE BODY WOULD NOT BE FAR OFF
BY THE SAME BRILLIANT REASONING EVERY MANS BODY IS TO BE FOUND IN
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF HIS WARDROBE AND PRAY WHAT DID YOU HOPE TO
ARRIVE AT THROUGH THIS
AT SOME EVIDENCE IMPLICATING FLORA MILLAR IN THE DISAPPEARANCE
I AM AFRAID THAT YOU WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT
ARE YOU INDEED NOW CRIED LESTRADE WITH SOME BITTERNESS I AM
AFRAID HOLMES THAT YOU ARE NOT VERY PRACTICAL WITH YOUR DEDUCTIONS
AND YOUR INFERENCES YOU HAVE MADE TWO BLUNDERS IN AS MANY MINUTES
THIS DRESS DOES IMPLICATE MISS FLORA MILLAR
AND HOW
IN THE DRESS IS A POCKET IN THE POCKET IS A CARDCASE IN THE
CARDCASE IS A NOTE AND HERE IS THE VERY NOTE HE SLAPPED IT DOWN
UPON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF HIM LISTEN TO THIS
YOU WILL SEE ME WHEN ALL IS READY COME AT ONCE
FHM
NOW MY THEORY ALL ALONG HAS BEEN THAT LADY ST SIMON WAS DECOYED AWAY
BY FLORA MILLAR AND THAT SHE WITH CONFEDERATES NO DOUBT WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DISAPPEARANCE HERE SIGNED WITH HER INITIALS IS
THE VERY NOTE WHICH WAS NO DOUBT QUIETLY SLIPPED INTO HER HAND AT THE
DOOR AND WHICH LURED HER WITHIN THEIR REACH
VERY GOOD LESTRADE SAID HOLMES LAUGHING YOU REALLY ARE VERY
FINE INDEED LET ME SEE IT HE TOOK UP THE PAPER IN A LISTLESS WAY
BUT HIS ATTENTION INSTANTLY BECAME RIVETED AND HE GAVE A LITTLE CRY
OF SATISFACTION THIS IS INDEED IMPORTANT SAID HE
HA YOU FIND IT SO
EXTREMELY SO I CONGRATULATE YOU WARMLY
LESTRADE ROSE IN HIS TRIUMPH AND BENT HIS HEAD TO LOOK WHY HE
SHRIEKED YOURE LOOKING AT THE WRONG SIDE
ON THE CONTRARY THIS IS THE RIGHT SIDE
THE RIGHT SIDE YOURE MAD HERE IS THE NOTE WRITTEN IN PENCIL OVER
HERE
AND OVER HERE IS WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE FRAGMENT OF A HOTEL BILL
WHICH INTERESTS ME DEEPLY
THERES NOTHING IN IT I LOOKED AT IT BEFORE SAID LESTRADE
OCT TH ROOMS S BREAKFAST S D COCKTAIL S LUNCH S
D GLASS SHERRY D I SEE NOTHING IN THAT
VERY LIKELY NOT IT IS MOST IMPORTANT ALL THE SAME AS TO THE NOTE
IT IS IMPORTANT ALSO OR AT LEAST THE INITIALS ARE SO I CONGRATULATE
YOU AGAIN
IVE WASTED TIME ENOUGH SAID LESTRADE RISING I BELIEVE IN HARD
WORK AND NOT IN SITTING BY THE FIRE SPINNING FINE THEORIES GOODDAY
MR HOLMES AND WE SHALL SEE WHICH GETS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MATTER
FIRST HE GATHERED UP THE GARMENTS THRUST THEM INTO THE BAG AND
MADE FOR THE DOOR
JUST ONE HINT TO YOU LESTRADE DRAWLED HOLMES BEFORE HIS RIVAL
VANISHED I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUE SOLUTION OF THE MATTER LADY ST
SIMON IS A MYTH THERE IS NOT AND THERE NEVER HAS BEEN ANY SUCH
PERSON
LESTRADE LOOKED SADLY AT MY COMPANION THEN HE TURNED TO ME TAPPED
HIS FOREHEAD THREE TIMES SHOOK HIS HEAD SOLEMNLY AND HURRIED AWAY
HE HAD HARDLY SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HIM WHEN HOLMES ROSE TO PUT ON HIS
OVERCOAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN WHAT THE FELLOW SAYS ABOUT OUTDOOR
WORK HE REMARKED SO I THINK WATSON THAT I MUST LEAVE YOU TO
YOUR PAPERS FOR A LITTLE
IT WAS AFTER FIVE OCLOCK WHEN SHERLOCK HOLMES LEFT ME BUT I HAD NO
TIME TO BE LONELY FOR WITHIN AN HOUR THERE ARRIVED A CONFECTIONERS
MAN WITH A VERY LARGE FLAT BOX THIS HE UNPACKED WITH THE HELP OF A
YOUTH WHOM HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AND PRESENTLY TO MY VERY GREAT
ASTONISHMENT A QUITE EPICUREAN LITTLE COLD SUPPER BEGAN TO BE LAID
OUT UPON OUR HUMBLE LODGINGHOUSE MAHOGANY THERE WERE A COUPLE OF
BRACE OF COLD WOODCOCK A PHEASANT A PT DE FOIE GRAS PIE WITH A
GROUP OF ANCIENT AND COBWEBBY BOTTLES HAVING LAID OUT ALL THESE
LUXURIES MY TWO VISITORS VANISHED AWAY LIKE THE GENII OF THE
ARABIAN NIGHTS WITH NO EXPLANATION SAVE THAT THE THINGS HAD BEEN
PAID FOR AND WERE ORDERED TO THIS ADDRESS
JUST BEFORE NINE OCLOCK SHERLOCK HOLMES STEPPED BRISKLY INTO THE
ROOM HIS FEATURES WERE GRAVELY SET BUT THERE WAS A LIGHT IN HIS EYE
WHICH MADE ME THINK THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN HIS
CONCLUSIONS
THEY HAVE LAID THE SUPPER THEN HE SAID RUBBING HIS HANDS
YOU SEEM TO EXPECT COMPANY THEY HAVE LAID FOR FIVE
YES I FANCY WE MAY HAVE SOME COMPANY DROPPING IN SAID HE I AM
SURPRISED THAT LORD ST SIMON HAS NOT ALREADY ARRIVED HA I FANCY
THAT I HEAR HIS STEP NOW UPON THE STAIRS
IT WAS INDEED OUR VISITOR OF THE AFTERNOON WHO CAME BUSTLING IN
DANGLING HIS GLASSES MORE VIGOROUSLY THAN EVER AND WITH A VERY
PERTURBED EXPRESSION UPON HIS ARISTOCRATIC FEATURES
MY MESSENGER REACHED YOU THEN ASKED HOLMES
YES AND I CONFESS THAT THE CONTENTS STARTLED ME BEYOND MEASURE
HAVE YOU GOOD AUTHORITY FOR WHAT YOU SAY THE BEST POSSIBLE
LORD ST SIMON SANK INTO A CHAIR AND PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS
FOREHEAD
WHAT WILL THE DUKE SAY HE MURMURED WHEN HE HEARS THAT ONE OF THE
FAMILY HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO SUCH HUMILIATION
IT IS THE PUREST ACCIDENT I CANNOT ALLOW THAT THERE IS ANY
HUMILIATION
AH YOU LOOK ON THESE THINGS FROM ANOTHER STANDPOINT
I FAIL TO SEE THAT ANYONE IS TO BLAME I CAN HARDLY SEE HOW THE LADY
COULD HAVE ACTED OTHERWISE THOUGH HER ABRUPT METHOD OF DOING IT WAS
UNDOUBTEDLY TO BE REGRETTED HAVING NO MOTHER SHE HAD NO ONE TO
ADVISE HER AT SUCH A CRISIS
IT WAS A SLIGHT SIR A PUBLIC SLIGHT SAID LORD ST SIMON TAPPING
HIS FINGERS UPON THE TABLE
YOU MUST MAKE ALLOWANCE FOR THIS POOR GIRL PLACED IN SO
UNPRECEDENTED A POSITION
I WILL MAKE NO ALLOWANCE I AM VERY ANGRY INDEED AND I HAVE BEEN
SHAMEFULLY USED
I THINK THAT I HEARD A RING SAID HOLMES YES THERE ARE STEPS ON
THE LANDING IF I CANNOT PERSUADE YOU TO TAKE A LENIENT VIEW OF THE
MATTER LORD ST SIMON I HAVE BROUGHT AN ADVOCATE HERE WHO MAY BE
MORE SUCCESSFUL HE OPENED THE DOOR AND USHERED IN A LADY AND
GENTLEMAN LORD ST SIMON SAID HE ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO
MR AND MRS FRANCIS HAY MOULTON THE LADY I THINK YOU HAVE ALREADY
MET
AT THE SIGHT OF THESE NEWCOMERS OUR CLIENT HAD SPRUNG FROM HIS SEAT
AND STOOD VERY ERECT WITH HIS EYES CAST DOWN AND HIS HAND THRUST
INTO THE BREAST OF HIS FROCKCOAT A PICTURE OF OFFENDED DIGNITY THE
LADY HAD TAKEN A QUICK STEP FORWARD AND HAD HELD OUT HER HAND TO HIM
BUT HE STILL REFUSED TO RAISE HIS EYES IT WAS AS WELL FOR HIS
RESOLUTION PERHAPS FOR HER PLEADING FACE WAS ONE WHICH IT WAS HARD
TO RESIST
YOURE ANGRY ROBERT SAID SHE WELL I GUESS YOU HAVE EVERY CAUSE
TO BE
PRAY MAKE NO APOLOGY TO ME SAID LORD ST SIMON BITTERLY
OH YES I KNOW THAT I HAVE TREATED YOU REAL BAD AND THAT I SHOULD
HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU BEFORE I WENT BUT I WAS KIND OF RATTLED AND FROM
THE TIME WHEN I SAW FRANK HERE AGAIN I JUST DIDNT KNOW WHAT I WAS
DOING OR SAYING I ONLY WONDER I DIDNT FALL DOWN AND DO A FAINT
RIGHT THERE BEFORE THE ALTAR
PERHAPS MRS MOULTON YOU WOULD LIKE MY FRIEND AND ME TO LEAVE THE
ROOM WHILE YOU EXPLAIN THIS MATTER
IF I MAY GIVE AN OPINION REMARKED THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN WEVE
HAD JUST A LITTLE TOO MUCH SECRECY OVER THIS BUSINESS ALREADY FOR MY
PART I SHOULD LIKE ALL EUROPE AND AMERICA TO HEAR THE RIGHTS OF IT
HE WAS A SMALL WIRY SUNBURNT MAN CLEANSHAVEN WITH A SHARP FACE
AND ALERT MANNER
THEN ILL TELL OUR STORY RIGHT AWAY SAID THE LADY FRANK HERE AND
I MET IN IN MCQUIRES CAMP NEAR THE ROCKIES WHERE PA WAS
WORKING A CLAIM WE WERE ENGAGED TO EACH OTHER FRANK AND I BUT THEN
ONE DAY FATHER STRUCK A RICH POCKET AND MADE A PILE WHILE POOR FRANK
HERE HAD A CLAIM THAT PETERED OUT AND CAME TO NOTHING THE RICHER PA
GREW THE POORER WAS FRANK SO AT LAST PA WOULDNT HEAR OF OUR
ENGAGEMENT LASTING ANY LONGER AND HE TOOK ME AWAY TO FRISCO FRANK
WOULDNT THROW UP HIS HAND THOUGH SO HE FOLLOWED ME THERE AND HE
SAW ME WITHOUT PA KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT IT WOULD ONLY HAVE MADE
HIM MAD TO KNOW SO WE JUST FIXED IT ALL UP FOR OURSELVES FRANK SAID
THAT HE WOULD GO AND MAKE HIS PILE TOO AND NEVER COME BACK TO CLAIM
ME UNTIL HE HAD AS MUCH AS PA SO THEN I PROMISED TO WAIT FOR HIM TO
THE END OF TIME AND PLEDGED MYSELF NOT TO MARRY ANYONE ELSE WHILE HE
LIVED WHY SHOULDNT WE BE MARRIED RIGHT AWAY THEN SAID HE AND
THEN I WILL FEEL SURE OF YOU AND I WONT CLAIM TO BE YOUR HUSBAND
UNTIL I COME BACK WELL WE TALKED IT OVER AND HE HAD FIXED IT ALL
UP SO NICELY WITH A CLERGYMAN ALL READY IN WAITING THAT WE JUST DID
IT RIGHT THERE AND THEN FRANK WENT OFF TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE AND I
WENT BACK TO PA
THE NEXT I HEARD OF FRANK WAS THAT HE WAS IN MONTANA AND THEN HE
WENT PROSPECTING IN ARIZONA AND THEN I HEARD OF HIM FROM NEW MEXICO
AFTER THAT CAME A LONG NEWSPAPER STORY ABOUT HOW A MINERS CAMP HAD
BEEN ATTACKED BY APACHE INDIANS AND THERE WAS MY FRANKS NAME AMONG
THE KILLED I FAINTED DEAD AWAY AND I WAS VERY SICK FOR MONTHS
AFTER PA THOUGHT I HAD A DECLINE AND TOOK ME TO HALF THE DOCTORS IN
FRISCO NOT A WORD OF NEWS CAME FOR A YEAR AND MORE SO THAT I NEVER
DOUBTED THAT FRANK WAS REALLY DEAD THEN LORD ST SIMON CAME TO
FRISCO AND WE CAME TO LONDON AND A MARRIAGE WAS ARRANGED AND PA
WAS VERY PLEASED BUT I FELT ALL THE TIME THAT NO MAN ON THIS EARTH
WOULD EVER TAKE THE PLACE IN MY HEART THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO MY POOR
FRANK
STILL IF I HAD MARRIED LORD ST SIMON OF COURSE ID HAVE DONE MY
DUTY BY HIM WE CANT COMMAND OUR LOVE BUT WE CAN OUR ACTIONS I
WENT TO THE ALTAR WITH HIM WITH THE INTENTION TO MAKE HIM JUST AS
GOOD A WIFE AS IT WAS IN ME TO BE BUT YOU MAY IMAGINE WHAT I FELT
WHEN JUST AS I CAME TO THE ALTAR RAILS I GLANCED BACK AND SAW FRANK
STANDING AND LOOKING AT ME OUT OF THE FIRST PEW I THOUGHT IT WAS HIS
GHOST AT FIRST BUT WHEN I LOOKED AGAIN THERE HE WAS STILL WITH A
KIND OF QUESTION IN HIS EYES AS IF TO ASK ME WHETHER I WERE GLAD OR
SORRY TO SEE HIM I WONDER I DIDNT DROP I KNOW THAT EVERYTHING WAS
TURNING ROUND AND THE WORDS OF THE CLERGYMAN WERE JUST LIKE THE BUZZ
OF A BEE IN MY EAR I DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHOULD I STOP THE
SERVICE AND MAKE A SCENE IN THE CHURCH I GLANCED AT HIM AGAIN AND
HE SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING FOR HE RAISED HIS FINGER TO
HIS LIPS TO TELL ME TO BE STILL THEN I SAW HIM SCRIBBLE ON A PIECE
OF PAPER AND I KNEW THAT HE WAS WRITING ME A NOTE AS I PASSED HIS
PEW ON THE WAY OUT I DROPPED MY BOUQUET OVER TO HIM AND HE SLIPPED
THE NOTE INTO MY HAND WHEN HE RETURNED ME THE FLOWERS IT WAS ONLY A
LINE ASKING ME TO JOIN HIM WHEN HE MADE THE SIGN TO ME TO DO SO OF
COURSE I NEVER DOUBTED FOR A MOMENT THAT MY FIRST DUTY WAS NOW TO
HIM AND I DETERMINED TO DO JUST WHATEVER HE MIGHT DIRECT
WHEN I GOT BACK I TOLD MY MAID WHO HAD KNOWN HIM IN CALIFORNIA AND
HAD ALWAYS BEEN HIS FRIEND I ORDERED HER TO SAY NOTHING BUT TO GET
A FEW THINGS PACKED AND MY ULSTER READY I KNOW I OUGHT TO HAVE
SPOKEN TO LORD ST SIMON BUT IT WAS DREADFUL HARD BEFORE HIS MOTHER
AND ALL THOSE GREAT PEOPLE I JUST MADE UP MY MIND TO RUN AWAY AND
EXPLAIN AFTERWARDS I HADNT BEEN AT THE TABLE TEN MINUTES BEFORE I
SAW FRANK OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD HE
BECKONED TO ME AND THEN BEGAN WALKING INTO THE PARK I SLIPPED OUT
PUT ON MY THINGS AND FOLLOWED HIM SOME WOMAN CAME TALKING SOMETHING
OR OTHER ABOUT LORD ST SIMON TO MESEEMED TO ME FROM THE LITTLE I
HEARD AS IF HE HAD A LITTLE SECRET OF HIS OWN BEFORE MARRIAGE
ALSOBUT I MANAGED TO GET AWAY FROM HER AND SOON OVERTOOK FRANK WE
GOT INTO A CAB TOGETHER AND AWAY WE DROVE TO SOME LODGINGS HE HAD
TAKEN IN GORDON SQUARE AND THAT WAS MY TRUE WEDDING AFTER ALL THOSE
YEARS OF WAITING FRANK HAD BEEN A PRISONER AMONG THE APACHES HAD
ESCAPED CAME ON TO FRISCO FOUND THAT I HAD GIVEN HIM UP FOR DEAD
AND HAD GONE TO ENGLAND FOLLOWED ME THERE AND HAD COME UPON ME AT
LAST ON THE VERY MORNING OF MY SECOND WEDDING
I SAW IT IN A PAPER EXPLAINED THE AMERICAN IT GAVE THE NAME AND
THE CHURCH BUT NOT WHERE THE LADY LIVED
THEN WE HAD A TALK AS TO WHAT WE SHOULD DO AND FRANK WAS ALL FOR
OPENNESS BUT I WAS SO ASHAMED OF IT ALL THAT I FELT AS IF I SHOULD
LIKE TO VANISH AWAY AND NEVER SEE ANY OF THEM AGAINJUST SENDING A
LINE TO PA PERHAPS TO SHOW HIM THAT I WAS ALIVE IT WAS AWFUL TO ME
TO THINK OF ALL THOSE LORDS AND LADIES SITTING ROUND THAT
BREAKFASTTABLE AND WAITING FOR ME TO COME BACK SO FRANK TOOK MY
WEDDINGCLOTHES AND THINGS AND MADE A BUNDLE OF THEM SO THAT I
SHOULD NOT BE TRACED AND DROPPED THEM AWAY SOMEWHERE WHERE NO ONE
COULD FIND THEM IT IS LIKELY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE GONE ON TO PARIS
TOMORROW ONLY THAT THIS GOOD GENTLEMAN MR HOLMES CAME ROUND TO
US THIS EVENING THOUGH HOW HE FOUND US IS MORE THAN I CAN THINK AND
HE SHOWED US VERY CLEARLY AND KINDLY THAT I WAS WRONG AND THAT FRANK
WAS RIGHT AND THAT WE SHOULD BE PUTTING OURSELVES IN THE WRONG IF WE
WERE SO SECRET THEN HE OFFERED TO GIVE US A CHANCE OF TALKING TO
LORD ST SIMON ALONE AND SO WE CAME RIGHT AWAY ROUND TO HIS ROOMS AT
ONCE NOW ROBERT YOU HAVE HEARD IT ALL AND I AM VERY SORRY IF I
HAVE GIVEN YOU PAIN AND I HOPE THAT YOU DO NOT THINK VERY MEANLY OF
ME
LORD ST SIMON HAD BY NO MEANS RELAXED HIS RIGID ATTITUDE BUT HAD
LISTENED WITH A FROWNING BROW AND A COMPRESSED LIP TO THIS LONG
NARRATIVE
EXCUSE ME HE SAID BUT IT IS NOT MY CUSTOM TO DISCUSS MY MOST
INTIMATE PERSONAL AFFAIRS IN THIS PUBLIC MANNER
THEN YOU WONT FORGIVE ME YOU WONT SHAKE HANDS BEFORE I GO
OH CERTAINLY IF IT WOULD GIVE YOU ANY PLEASURE HE PUT OUT HIS
HAND AND COLDLY GRASPED THAT WHICH SHE EXTENDED TO HIM
I HAD HOPED SUGGESTED HOLMES THAT YOU WOULD HAVE JOINED US IN A
FRIENDLY SUPPER
I THINK THAT THERE YOU ASK A LITTLE TOO MUCH RESPONDED HIS
LORDSHIP I MAY BE FORCED TO ACQUIESCE IN THESE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
BUT I CAN HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO MAKE MERRY OVER THEM I THINK THAT
WITH YOUR PERMISSION I WILL NOW WISH YOU ALL A VERY GOODNIGHT HE
INCLUDED US ALL IN A SWEEPING BOW AND STALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
THEN I TRUST THAT YOU AT LEAST WILL HONOUR ME WITH YOUR COMPANY
SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES IT IS ALWAYS A JOY TO MEET AN AMERICAN MR
MOULTON FOR I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLY OF A
MONARCH AND THE BLUNDERING OF A MINISTER IN FARGONE YEARS WILL NOT
PREVENT OUR CHILDREN FROM BEING SOME DAY CITIZENS OF THE SAME
WORLDWIDE COUNTRY UNDER A FLAG WHICH SHALL BE A QUARTERING OF THE
UNION JACK WITH THE STARS AND STRIPES
THE CASE HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING ONE REMARKED HOLMES WHEN OUR
VISITORS HAD LEFT US BECAUSE IT SERVES TO SHOW VERY CLEARLY HOW
SIMPLE THE EXPLANATION MAY BE OF AN AFFAIR WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT SEEMS
TO BE ALMOST INEXPLICABLE NOTHING COULD BE MORE NATURAL THAN THE
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AS NARRATED BY THIS LADY AND NOTHING STRANGER
THAN THE RESULT WHEN VIEWED FOR INSTANCE BY MR LESTRADE OF
SCOTLAND YARD
YOU WERE NOT YOURSELF AT FAULT AT ALL THEN
FROM THE FIRST TWO FACTS WERE VERY OBVIOUS TO ME THE ONE THAT THE
LADY HAD BEEN QUITE WILLING TO UNDERGO THE WEDDING CEREMONY THE
OTHER THAT SHE HAD REPENTED OF IT WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF RETURNING
HOME OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED DURING THE MORNING THEN TO
CAUSE HER TO CHANGE HER MIND WHAT COULD THAT SOMETHING BE SHE COULD
NOT HAVE SPOKEN TO ANYONE WHEN SHE WAS OUT FOR SHE HAD BEEN IN THE
COMPANY OF THE BRIDEGROOM HAD SHE SEEN SOMEONE THEN IF SHE HAD IT
MUST BE SOMEONE FROM AMERICA BECAUSE SHE HAD SPENT SO SHORT A TIME IN
THIS COUNTRY THAT SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE ALLOWED ANYONE TO ACQUIRE SO
DEEP AN INFLUENCE OVER HER THAT THE MERE SIGHT OF HIM WOULD INDUCE
HER TO CHANGE HER PLANS SO COMPLETELY YOU SEE WE HAVE ALREADY
ARRIVED BY A PROCESS OF EXCLUSION AT THE IDEA THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE
SEEN AN AMERICAN THEN WHO COULD THIS AMERICAN BE AND WHY SHOULD HE
POSSESS SO MUCH INFLUENCE OVER HER IT MIGHT BE A LOVER IT MIGHT BE
A HUSBAND HER YOUNG WOMANHOOD HAD I KNEW BEEN SPENT IN ROUGH
SCENES AND UNDER STRANGE CONDITIONS SO FAR I HAD GOT BEFORE I EVER
HEARD LORD ST SIMONS NARRATIVE WHEN HE TOLD US OF A MAN IN A PEW
OF THE CHANGE IN THE BRIDES MANNER OF SO TRANSPARENT A DEVICE FOR
OBTAINING A NOTE AS THE DROPPING OF A BOUQUET OF HER RESORT TO HER
CONFIDENTIAL MAID AND OF HER VERY SIGNIFICANT ALLUSION TO
CLAIMJUMPINGWHICH IN MINERS PARLANCE MEANS TAKING POSSESSION OF
THAT WHICH ANOTHER PERSON HAS A PRIOR CLAIM TOTHE WHOLE SITUATION
BECAME ABSOLUTELY CLEAR SHE HAD GONE OFF WITH A MAN AND THE MAN WAS
EITHER A LOVER OR WAS A PREVIOUS HUSBANDTHE CHANCES BEING IN FAVOUR
OF THE LATTER
AND HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU FIND THEM
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT BUT FRIEND LESTRADE HELD INFORMATION
IN HIS HANDS THE VALUE OF WHICH HE DID NOT HIMSELF KNOW THE INITIALS
WERE OF COURSE OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE BUT MORE VALUABLE STILL
WAS IT TO KNOW THAT WITHIN A WEEK HE HAD SETTLED HIS BILL AT ONE OF
THE MOST SELECT LONDON HOTELS
HOW DID YOU DEDUCE THE SELECT
BY THE SELECT PRICES EIGHT SHILLINGS FOR A BED AND EIGHTPENCE FOR A
GLASS OF SHERRY POINTED TO ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE HOTELS THERE
ARE NOT MANY IN LONDON WHICH CHARGE AT THAT RATE IN THE SECOND ONE
WHICH I VISITED IN NORTHUMBERLAND AVENUE I LEARNED BY AN INSPECTION
OF THE BOOK THAT FRANCIS H MOULTON AN AMERICAN GENTLEMAN HAD LEFT
ONLY THE DAY BEFORE AND ON LOOKING OVER THE ENTRIES AGAINST HIM I
CAME UPON THE VERY ITEMS WHICH I HAD SEEN IN THE DUPLICATE BILL HIS
LETTERS WERE TO BE FORWARDED TO GORDON SQUARE SO THITHER I
TRAVELLED AND BEING FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND THE LOVING COUPLE AT
HOME I VENTURED TO GIVE THEM SOME PATERNAL ADVICE AND TO POINT OUT
TO THEM THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER IN EVERY WAY THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE
THEIR POSITION A LITTLE CLEARER BOTH TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND TO
LORD ST SIMON IN PARTICULAR I INVITED THEM TO MEET HIM HERE AND
AS YOU SEE I MADE HIM KEEP THE APPOINTMENT
BUT WITH NO VERY GOOD RESULT I REMARKED HIS CONDUCT WAS
CERTAINLY NOT VERY GRACIOUS
AH WATSON SAID HOLMES SMILING PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT BE VERY
GRACIOUS EITHER IF AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE OF WOOING AND WEDDING YOU
FOUND YOURSELF DEPRIVED IN AN INSTANT OF WIFE AND OF FORTUNE I THINK
THAT WE MAY JUDGE LORD ST SIMON VERY MERCIFULLY AND THANK OUR STARS
THAT WE ARE NEVER LIKELY TO FIND OURSELVES IN THE SAME POSITION DRAW
YOUR CHAIR UP AND HAND ME MY VIOLIN FOR THE ONLY PROBLEM WE HAVE
STILL TO SOLVE IS HOW TO WHILE AWAY THESE BLEAK AUTUMNAL EVENINGS
THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
HOLMES SAID I AS I STOOD ONE MORNING IN OUR BOWWINDOW LOOKING
DOWN THE STREET HERE IS A MADMAN COMING ALONG IT SEEMS RATHER SAD
THAT HIS RELATIVES SHOULD ALLOW HIM TO COME OUT ALONE
MY FRIEND ROSE LAZILY FROM HIS ARMCHAIR AND STOOD WITH HIS HANDS IN
THE POCKETS OF HIS DRESSINGGOWN LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER IT WAS A
BRIGHT CRISP FEBRUARY MORNING AND THE SNOW OF THE DAY BEFORE STILL
LAY DEEP UPON THE GROUND SHIMMERING BRIGHTLY IN THE WINTRY SUN DOWN
THE CENTRE OF BAKER STREET IT HAD BEEN PLOUGHED INTO A BROWN CRUMBLY
BAND BY THE TRAFFIC BUT AT EITHER SIDE AND ON THE HEAPEDUP EDGES OF
THE FOOTPATHS IT STILL LAY AS WHITE AS WHEN IT FELL THE GREY
PAVEMENT HAD BEEN CLEANED AND SCRAPED BUT WAS STILL DANGEROUSLY
SLIPPERY SO THAT THERE WERE FEWER PASSENGERS THAN USUAL INDEED
FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE METROPOLITAN STATION NO ONE WAS COMING SAVE
THE SINGLE GENTLEMAN WHOSE ECCENTRIC CONDUCT HAD DRAWN MY ATTENTION
HE WAS A MAN OF ABOUT FIFTY TALL PORTLY AND IMPOSING WITH A
MASSIVE STRONGLY MARKED FACE AND A COMMANDING FIGURE HE WAS DRESSED
IN A SOMBRE YET RICH STYLE IN BLACK FROCKCOAT SHINING HAT NEAT
BROWN GAITERS AND WELLCUT PEARLGREY TROUSERS YET HIS ACTIONS WERE
IN ABSURD CONTRAST TO THE DIGNITY OF HIS DRESS AND FEATURES FOR HE
WAS RUNNING HARD WITH OCCASIONAL LITTLE SPRINGS SUCH AS A WEARY MAN
GIVES WHO IS LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO SET ANY TAX UPON HIS LEGS AS HE
RAN HE JERKED HIS HANDS UP AND DOWN WAGGLED HIS HEAD AND WRITHED
HIS FACE INTO THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONTORTIONS
WHAT ON EARTH CAN BE THE MATTER WITH HIM I ASKED HE IS LOOKING
UP AT THE NUMBERS OF THE HOUSES
I BELIEVE THAT HE IS COMING HERE SAID HOLMES RUBBING HIS HANDS
HERE
YES I RATHER THINK HE IS COMING TO CONSULT ME PROFESSIONALLY I
THINK THAT I RECOGNISE THE SYMPTOMS HA DID I NOT TELL YOU AS HE
SPOKE THE MAN PUFFING AND BLOWING RUSHED AT OUR DOOR AND PULLED AT
OUR BELL UNTIL THE WHOLE HOUSE RESOUNDED WITH THE CLANGING
A FEW MOMENTS LATER HE WAS IN OUR ROOM STILL PUFFING STILL
GESTICULATING BUT WITH SO FIXED A LOOK OF GRIEF AND DESPAIR IN HIS
EYES THAT OUR SMILES WERE TURNED IN AN INSTANT TO HORROR AND PITY
FOR A WHILE HE COULD NOT GET HIS WORDS OUT BUT SWAYED HIS BODY AND
PLUCKED AT HIS HAIR LIKE ONE WHO HAS BEEN DRIVEN TO THE EXTREME
LIMITS OF HIS REASON THEN SUDDENLY SPRINGING TO HIS FEET HE BEAT
HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL WITH SUCH FORCE THAT WE BOTH RUSHED UPON
HIM AND TORE HIM AWAY TO THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM SHERLOCK HOLMES
PUSHED HIM DOWN INTO THE EASYCHAIR AND SITTING BESIDE HIM PATTED
HIS HAND AND CHATTED WITH HIM IN THE EASY SOOTHING TONES WHICH HE
KNEW SO WELL HOW TO EMPLOY
YOU HAVE COME TO ME TO TELL YOUR STORY HAVE YOU NOT SAID HE YOU
ARE FATIGUED WITH YOUR HASTE PRAY WAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE RECOVERED
YOURSELF AND THEN I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO LOOK INTO ANY LITTLE
PROBLEM WHICH YOU MAY SUBMIT TO ME
THE MAN SAT FOR A MINUTE OR MORE WITH A HEAVING CHEST FIGHTING
AGAINST HIS EMOTION THEN HE PASSED HIS HANDKERCHIEF OVER HIS BROW
SET HIS LIPS TIGHT AND TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS US
NO DOUBT YOU THINK ME MAD SAID HE
I SEE THAT YOU HAVE HAD SOME GREAT TROUBLE RESPONDED HOLMES
GOD KNOWS I HAVEA TROUBLE WHICH IS ENOUGH TO UNSEAT MY REASON SO
SUDDEN AND SO TERRIBLE IS IT PUBLIC DISGRACE I MIGHT HAVE FACED
ALTHOUGH I AM A MAN WHOSE CHARACTER HAS NEVER YET BORNE A STAIN
PRIVATE AFFLICTION ALSO IS THE LOT OF EVERY MAN BUT THE TWO COMING
TOGETHER AND IN SO FRIGHTFUL A FORM HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO SHAKE MY
VERY SOUL BESIDES IT IS NOT I ALONE THE VERY NOBLEST IN THE LAND
MAY SUFFER UNLESS SOME WAY BE FOUND OUT OF THIS HORRIBLE AFFAIR
PRAY COMPOSE YOURSELF SIR SAID HOLMES AND LET ME HAVE A CLEAR
ACCOUNT OF WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT IT IS THAT HAS BEFALLEN YOU
MY NAME ANSWERED OUR VISITOR IS PROBABLY FAMILIAR TO YOUR EARS
I AM ALEXANDER HOLDER OF THE BANKING FIRM OF HOLDER STEVENSON OF
THREADNEEDLE STREET
THE NAME WAS INDEED WELL KNOWN TO US AS BELONGING TO THE SENIOR
PARTNER IN THE SECOND LARGEST PRIVATE BANKING CONCERN IN THE CITY OF
LONDON WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED THEN TO BRING ONE OF THE FOREMOST
CITIZENS OF LONDON TO THIS MOST PITIABLE PASS WE WAITED ALL
CURIOSITY UNTIL WITH ANOTHER EFFORT HE BRACED HIMSELF TO TELL HIS
STORY
I FEEL THAT TIME IS OF VALUE SAID HE THAT IS WHY I HASTENED HERE
WHEN THE POLICE INSPECTOR SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD SECURE YOUR
COOPERATION I CAME TO BAKER STREET BY THE UNDERGROUND AND HURRIED
FROM THERE ON FOOT FOR THE CABS GO SLOWLY THROUGH THIS SNOW THAT IS
WHY I WAS SO OUT OF BREATH FOR I AM A MAN WHO TAKES VERY LITTLE
EXERCISE I FEEL BETTER NOW AND I WILL PUT THE FACTS BEFORE YOU AS
SHORTLY AND YET AS CLEARLY AS I CAN
IT IS OF COURSE WELL KNOWN TO YOU THAT IN A SUCCESSFUL BANKING
BUSINESS AS MUCH DEPENDS UPON OUR BEING ABLE TO FIND REMUNERATIVE
INVESTMENTS FOR OUR FUNDS AS UPON OUR INCREASING OUR CONNECTION AND
THE NUMBER OF OUR DEPOSITORS ONE OF OUR MOST LUCRATIVE MEANS OF
LAYING OUT MONEY IS IN THE SHAPE OF LOANS WHERE THE SECURITY IS
UNIMPEACHABLE WE HAVE DONE A GOOD DEAL IN THIS DIRECTION DURING THE
LAST FEW YEARS AND THERE ARE MANY NOBLE FAMILIES TO WHOM WE HAVE
ADVANCED LARGE SUMS UPON THE SECURITY OF THEIR PICTURES LIBRARIES
OR PLATE
YESTERDAY MORNING I WAS SEATED IN MY OFFICE AT THE BANK WHEN A CARD
WAS BROUGHT IN TO ME BY ONE OF THE CLERKS I STARTED WHEN I SAW THE
NAME FOR IT WAS THAT OF NONE OTHER THANWELL PERHAPS EVEN TO YOU I
HAD BETTER SAY NO MORE THAN THAT IT WAS A NAME WHICH IS A HOUSEHOLD
WORD ALL OVER THE EARTHONE OF THE HIGHEST NOBLEST MOST EXALTED
NAMES IN ENGLAND I WAS OVERWHELMED BY THE HONOUR AND ATTEMPTED WHEN
HE ENTERED TO SAY SO BUT HE PLUNGED AT ONCE INTO BUSINESS WITH THE
AIR OF A MAN WHO WISHES TO HURRY QUICKLY THROUGH A DISAGREEABLE TASK
MR HOLDER SAID HE I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT YOU ARE IN THE
HABIT OF ADVANCING MONEY
THE FIRM DOES SO WHEN THE SECURITY IS GOOD I ANSWERED
IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO ME SAID HE THAT I SHOULD HAVE
AT ONCE I COULD OF COURSE BORROW SO TRIFLING A SUM TEN
TIMES OVER FROM MY FRIENDS BUT I MUCH PREFER TO MAKE IT A MATTER OF
BUSINESS AND TO CARRY OUT THAT BUSINESS MYSELF IN MY POSITION YOU
CAN READILY UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS UNWISE TO PLACE ONES SELF UNDER
OBLIGATIONS
FOR HOW LONG MAY I ASK DO YOU WANT THIS SUM I ASKED
NEXT MONDAY I HAVE A LARGE SUM DUE TO ME AND I SHALL THEN MOST
CERTAINLY REPAY WHAT YOU ADVANCE WITH WHATEVER INTEREST YOU THINK IT
RIGHT TO CHARGE BUT IT IS VERY ESSENTIAL TO ME THAT THE MONEY SHOULD
BE PAID AT ONCE
I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO ADVANCE IT WITHOUT FURTHER PARLEY FROM MY OWN
PRIVATE PURSE SAID I WERE IT NOT THAT THE STRAIN WOULD BE RATHER
MORE THAN IT COULD BEAR IF ON THE OTHER HAND I AM TO DO IT IN THE
NAME OF THE FIRM THEN IN JUSTICE TO MY PARTNER I MUST INSIST THAT
EVEN IN YOUR CASE EVERY BUSINESSLIKE PRECAUTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
I SHOULD MUCH PREFER TO HAVE IT SO SAID HE RAISING UP A SQUARE
BLACK MOROCCO CASE WHICH HE HAD LAID BESIDE HIS CHAIR YOU HAVE
DOUBTLESS HEARD OF THE BERYL CORONET
ONE OF THE MOST PRECIOUS PUBLIC POSSESSIONS OF THE EMPIRE SAID I
PRECISELY HE OPENED THE CASE AND THERE IMBEDDED IN SOFT
FLESHCOLOURED VELVET LAY THE MAGNIFICENT PIECE OF JEWELLERY WHICH
HE HAD NAMED THERE ARE THIRTYNINE ENORMOUS BERYLS SAID HE AND
THE PRICE OF THE GOLD CHASING IS INCALCULABLE THE LOWEST ESTIMATE
WOULD PUT THE WORTH OF THE CORONET AT DOUBLE THE SUM WHICH I HAVE
ASKED I AM PREPARED TO LEAVE IT WITH YOU AS MY SECURITY
I TOOK THE PRECIOUS CASE INTO MY HANDS AND LOOKED IN SOME PERPLEXITY
FROM IT TO MY ILLUSTRIOUS CLIENT
YOU DOUBT ITS VALUE HE ASKED
NOT AT ALL I ONLY DOUBT
THE PROPRIETY OF MY LEAVING IT YOU MAY SET YOUR MIND AT REST ABOUT
THAT I SHOULD NOT DREAM OF DOING SO WERE IT NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE IN FOUR DAYS TO RECLAIM IT IT IS A PURE MATTER
OF FORM IS THE SECURITY SUFFICIENT
AMPLE
YOU UNDERSTAND MR HOLDER THAT I AM GIVING YOU A STRONG PROOF OF
THE CONFIDENCE WHICH I HAVE IN YOU FOUNDED UPON ALL THAT I HAVE
HEARD OF YOU I RELY UPON YOU NOT ONLY TO BE DISCREET AND TO REFRAIN
FROM ALL GOSSIP UPON THE MATTER BUT ABOVE ALL TO PRESERVE THIS
CORONET WITH EVERY POSSIBLE PRECAUTION BECAUSE I NEED NOT SAY THAT A
GREAT PUBLIC SCANDAL WOULD BE CAUSED IF ANY HARM WERE TO BEFALL IT
ANY INJURY TO IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS SERIOUS AS ITS COMPLETE LOSS FOR
THERE ARE NO BERYLS IN THE WORLD TO MATCH THESE AND IT WOULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE TO REPLACE THEM I LEAVE IT WITH YOU HOWEVER WITH EVERY
CONFIDENCE AND I SHALL CALL FOR IT IN PERSON ON MONDAY MORNING
SEEING THAT MY CLIENT WAS ANXIOUS TO LEAVE I SAID NO MORE BUT
CALLING FOR MY CASHIER I ORDERED HIM TO PAY OVER FIFTY NOTES
WHEN I WAS ALONE ONCE MORE HOWEVER WITH THE PRECIOUS CASE LYING
UPON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF ME I COULD NOT BUT THINK WITH SOME
MISGIVINGS OF THE IMMENSE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IT ENTAILED UPON ME
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT AS IT WAS A NATIONAL POSSESSION A
HORRIBLE SCANDAL WOULD ENSUE IF ANY MISFORTUNE SHOULD OCCUR TO IT I
ALREADY REGRETTED HAVING EVER CONSENTED TO TAKE CHARGE OF IT
HOWEVER IT WAS TOO LATE TO ALTER THE MATTER NOW SO I LOCKED IT UP
IN MY PRIVATE SAFE AND TURNED ONCE MORE TO MY WORK
WHEN EVENING CAME I FELT THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPRUDENCE TO LEAVE SO
PRECIOUS A THING IN THE OFFICE BEHIND ME BANKERS SAFES HAD BEEN
FORCED BEFORE NOW AND WHY SHOULD NOT MINE BE IF SO HOW TERRIBLE
WOULD BE THE POSITION IN WHICH I SHOULD FIND MYSELF I DETERMINED
THEREFORE THAT FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS I WOULD ALWAYS CARRY THE CASE
BACKWARD AND FORWARD WITH ME SO THAT IT MIGHT NEVER BE REALLY OUT OF
MY REACH WITH THIS INTENTION I CALLED A CAB AND DROVE OUT TO MY
HOUSE AT STREATHAM CARRYING THE JEWEL WITH ME I DID NOT BREATHE
FREELY UNTIL I HAD TAKEN IT UPSTAIRS AND LOCKED IT IN THE BUREAU OF
MY DRESSINGROOM
AND NOW A WORD AS TO MY HOUSEHOLD MR HOLMES FOR I WISH YOU TO
THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION MY GROOM AND MY PAGE SLEEP OUT
OF THE HOUSE AND MAY BE SET ASIDE ALTOGETHER I HAVE THREE
MAIDSERVANTS WHO HAVE BEEN WITH ME A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WHOSE
ABSOLUTE RELIABILITY IS QUITE ABOVE SUSPICION ANOTHER LUCY PARR
THE SECOND WAITINGMAID HAS ONLY BEEN IN MY SERVICE A FEW MONTHS
SHE CAME WITH AN EXCELLENT CHARACTER HOWEVER AND HAS ALWAYS GIVEN
ME SATISFACTION SHE IS A VERY PRETTY GIRL AND HAS ATTRACTED ADMIRERS
WHO HAVE OCCASIONALLY HUNG ABOUT THE PLACE THAT IS THE ONLY DRAWBACK
WHICH WE HAVE FOUND TO HER BUT WE BELIEVE HER TO BE A THOROUGHLY
GOOD GIRL IN EVERY WAY
SO MUCH FOR THE SERVANTS MY FAMILY ITSELF IS SO SMALL THAT IT WILL
NOT TAKE ME LONG TO DESCRIBE IT I AM A WIDOWER AND HAVE AN ONLY SON
ARTHUR HE HAS BEEN A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME MR HOLMESA GRIEVOUS
DISAPPOINTMENT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I AM MYSELF TO BLAME PEOPLE
TELL ME THAT I HAVE SPOILED HIM VERY LIKELY I HAVE WHEN MY DEAR
WIFE DIED I FELT THAT HE WAS ALL I HAD TO LOVE I COULD NOT BEAR TO
SEE THE SMILE FADE EVEN FOR A MOMENT FROM HIS FACE I HAVE NEVER
DENIED HIM A WISH PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR BOTH OF US
HAD I BEEN STERNER BUT I MEANT IT FOR THE BEST
IT WAS NATURALLY MY INTENTION THAT HE SHOULD SUCCEED ME IN MY
BUSINESS BUT HE WAS NOT OF A BUSINESS TURN HE WAS WILD WAYWARD
AND TO SPEAK THE TRUTH I COULD NOT TRUST HIM IN THE HANDLING OF
LARGE SUMS OF MONEY WHEN HE WAS YOUNG HE BECAME A MEMBER OF AN
ARISTOCRATIC CLUB AND THERE HAVING CHARMING MANNERS HE WAS SOON
THE INTIMATE OF A NUMBER OF MEN WITH LONG PURSES AND EXPENSIVE
HABITS HE LEARNED TO PLAY HEAVILY AT CARDS AND TO SQUANDER MONEY ON
THE TURF UNTIL HE HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN TO COME TO ME AND IMPLORE ME
TO GIVE HIM AN ADVANCE UPON HIS ALLOWANCE THAT HE MIGHT SETTLE HIS
DEBTS OF HONOUR HE TRIED MORE THAN ONCE TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE
DANGEROUS COMPANY WHICH HE WAS KEEPING BUT EACH TIME THE INFLUENCE
OF HIS FRIEND SIR GEORGE BURNWELL WAS ENOUGH TO DRAW HIM BACK
AGAIN
AND INDEED I COULD NOT WONDER THAT SUCH A MAN AS SIR GEORGE
BURNWELL SHOULD GAIN AN INFLUENCE OVER HIM FOR HE HAS FREQUENTLY
BROUGHT HIM TO MY HOUSE AND I HAVE FOUND MYSELF THAT I COULD HARDLY
RESIST THE FASCINATION OF HIS MANNER HE IS OLDER THAN ARTHUR A MAN
OF THE WORLD TO HIS FINGERTIPS ONE WHO HAD BEEN EVERYWHERE SEEN
EVERYTHING A BRILLIANT TALKER AND A MAN OF GREAT PERSONAL BEAUTY
YET WHEN I THINK OF HIM IN COLD BLOOD FAR AWAY FROM THE GLAMOUR OF
HIS PRESENCE I AM CONVINCED FROM HIS CYNICAL SPEECH AND THE LOOK
WHICH I HAVE CAUGHT IN HIS EYES THAT HE IS ONE WHO SHOULD BE DEEPLY
DISTRUSTED SO I THINK AND SO TOO THINKS MY LITTLE MARY WHO HAS A
WOMANS QUICK INSIGHT INTO CHARACTER
AND NOW THERE IS ONLY SHE TO BE DESCRIBED SHE IS MY NIECE BUT WHEN
MY BROTHER DIED FIVE YEARS AGO AND LEFT HER ALONE IN THE WORLD I
ADOPTED HER AND HAVE LOOKED UPON HER EVER SINCE AS MY DAUGHTER SHE
IS A SUNBEAM IN MY HOUSESWEET LOVING BEAUTIFUL A WONDERFUL
MANAGER AND HOUSEKEEPER YET AS TENDER AND QUIET AND GENTLE AS A
WOMAN COULD BE SHE IS MY RIGHT HAND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I COULD DO
WITHOUT HER IN ONLY ONE MATTER HAS SHE EVER GONE AGAINST MY WISHES
TWICE MY BOY HAS ASKED HER TO MARRY HIM FOR HE LOVES HER DEVOTEDLY
BUT EACH TIME SHE HAS REFUSED HIM I THINK THAT IF ANYONE COULD HAVE
DRAWN HIM INTO THE RIGHT PATH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SHE AND THAT HIS
MARRIAGE MIGHT HAVE CHANGED HIS WHOLE LIFE BUT NOW ALAS IT IS TOO
LATEFOREVER TOO LATE
NOW MR HOLMES YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE UNDER MY ROOF AND I
SHALL CONTINUE WITH MY MISERABLE STORY
WHEN WE WERE TAKING COFFEE IN THE DRAWINGROOM THAT NIGHT AFTER
DINNER I TOLD ARTHUR AND MARY MY EXPERIENCE AND OF THE PRECIOUS
TREASURE WHICH WE HAD UNDER OUR ROOF SUPPRESSING ONLY THE NAME OF MY
CLIENT LUCY PARR WHO HAD BROUGHT IN THE COFFEE HAD I AM SURE
LEFT THE ROOM BUT I CANNOT SWEAR THAT THE DOOR WAS CLOSED MARY AND
ARTHUR WERE MUCH INTERESTED AND WISHED TO SEE THE FAMOUS CORONET BUT
I THOUGHT IT BETTER NOT TO DISTURB IT
WHERE HAVE YOU PUT IT ASKED ARTHUR
IN MY OWN BUREAU
WELL I HOPE TO GOODNESS THE HOUSE WONT BE BURGLED DURING THE
NIGHT SAID HE
IT IS LOCKED UP I ANSWERED
OH ANY OLD KEY WILL FIT THAT BUREAU WHEN I WAS A YOUNGSTER I HAVE
OPENED IT MYSELF WITH THE KEY OF THE BOXROOM CUPBOARD
HE OFTEN HAD A WILD WAY OF TALKING SO THAT I THOUGHT LITTLE OF WHAT
HE SAID HE FOLLOWED ME TO MY ROOM HOWEVER THAT NIGHT WITH A VERY
GRAVE FACE
LOOK HERE DAD SAID HE WITH HIS EYES CAST DOWN CAN YOU LET ME
HAVE NO I CANNOT I ANSWERED SHARPLY I HAVE BEEN FAR TOO GENEROUS
WITH YOU IN MONEY MATTERS
YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND SAID HE BUT I MUST HAVE THIS MONEY OR
ELSE I CAN NEVER SHOW MY FACE INSIDE THE CLUB AGAIN
AND A VERY GOOD THING TOO I CRIED
YES BUT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ME LEAVE IT A DISHONOURED MAN SAID
HE I COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE I MUST RAISE THE MONEY IN SOME
WAY AND IF YOU WILL NOT LET ME HAVE IT THEN I MUST TRY OTHER
MEANS
I WAS VERY ANGRY FOR THIS WAS THE THIRD DEMAND DURING THE MONTH
YOU SHALL NOT HAVE A FARTHING FROM ME I CRIED ON WHICH HE BOWED
AND LEFT THE ROOM WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
WHEN HE WAS GONE I UNLOCKED MY BUREAU MADE SURE THAT MY TREASURE
WAS SAFE AND LOCKED IT AGAIN THEN I STARTED TO GO ROUND THE HOUSE
TO SEE THAT ALL WAS SECUREA DUTY WHICH I USUALLY LEAVE TO MARY BUT
WHICH I THOUGHT IT WELL TO PERFORM MYSELF THAT NIGHT AS I CAME DOWN
THE STAIRS I SAW MARY HERSELF AT THE SIDE WINDOW OF THE HALL WHICH
SHE CLOSED AND FASTENED AS I APPROACHED
TELL ME DAD SAID SHE LOOKING I THOUGHT A LITTLE DISTURBED
DID YOU GIVE LUCY THE MAID LEAVE TO GO OUT TONIGHT
CERTAINLY NOT
SHE CAME IN JUST NOW BY THE BACK DOOR I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE HAS
ONLY BEEN TO THE SIDE GATE TO SEE SOMEONE BUT I THINK THAT IT IS
HARDLY SAFE AND SHOULD BE STOPPED
YOU MUST SPEAK TO HER IN THE MORNING OR I WILL IF YOU PREFER IT
ARE YOU SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS FASTENED
QUITE SURE DAD
THEN GOODNIGHT I KISSED HER AND WENT UP TO MY BEDROOM AGAIN
WHERE I WAS SOON ASLEEP
I AM ENDEAVOURING TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING MR HOLMES WHICH MAY HAVE
ANY BEARING UPON THE CASE BUT I BEG THAT YOU WILL QUESTION ME UPON
ANY POINT WHICH I DO NOT MAKE CLEAR
ON THE CONTRARY YOUR STATEMENT IS SINGULARLY LUCID
I COME TO A PART OF MY STORY NOW IN WHICH I SHOULD WISH TO BE
PARTICULARLY SO I AM NOT A VERY HEAVY SLEEPER AND THE ANXIETY IN MY
MIND TENDED NO DOUBT TO MAKE ME EVEN LESS SO THAN USUAL ABOUT TWO
IN THE MORNING THEN I WAS AWAKENED BY SOME SOUND IN THE HOUSE IT
HAD CEASED ERE I WAS WIDE AWAKE BUT IT HAD LEFT AN IMPRESSION BEHIND
IT AS THOUGH A WINDOW HAD GENTLY CLOSED SOMEWHERE I LAY LISTENING
WITH ALL MY EARS SUDDENLY TO MY HORROR THERE WAS A DISTINCT SOUND
OF FOOTSTEPS MOVING SOFTLY IN THE NEXT ROOM I SLIPPED OUT OF BED
ALL PALPITATING WITH FEAR AND PEEPED ROUND THE CORNER OF MY
DRESSINGROOM DOOR
ARTHUR I SCREAMED YOU VILLAIN YOU THIEF HOW DARE YOU TOUCH
THAT CORONET
THE GAS WAS HALF UP AS I HAD LEFT IT AND MY UNHAPPY BOY DRESSED
ONLY IN HIS SHIRT AND TROUSERS WAS STANDING BESIDE THE LIGHT
HOLDING THE CORONET IN HIS HANDS HE APPEARED TO BE WRENCHING AT IT
OR BENDING IT WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH AT MY CRY HE DROPPED IT FROM HIS
GRASP AND TURNED AS PALE AS DEATH I SNATCHED IT UP AND EXAMINED IT
ONE OF THE GOLD CORNERS WITH THREE OF THE BERYLS IN IT WAS MISSING
YOU BLACKGUARD I SHOUTED BESIDE MYSELF WITH RAGE YOU HAVE
DESTROYED IT YOU HAVE DISHONOURED ME FOREVER WHERE ARE THE JEWELS
WHICH YOU HAVE STOLEN
STOLEN HE CRIED
YES THIEF I ROARED SHAKING HIM BY THE SHOULDER
THERE ARE NONE MISSING THERE CANNOT BE ANY MISSING SAID HE
THERE ARE THREE MISSING AND YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE MUST I CALL
YOU A LIAR AS WELL AS A THIEF DID I NOT SEE YOU TRYING TO TEAR OFF
ANOTHER PIECE
YOU HAVE CALLED ME NAMES ENOUGH SAID HE I WILL NOT STAND IT ANY
LONGER I SHALL NOT SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT THIS BUSINESS SINCE YOU
HAVE CHOSEN TO INSULT ME I WILL LEAVE YOUR HOUSE IN THE MORNING AND
MAKE MY OWN WAY IN THE WORLD
YOU SHALL LEAVE IT IN THE HANDS OF THE POLICE I CRIED HALFMAD
WITH GRIEF AND RAGE I SHALL HAVE THIS MATTER PROBED TO THE BOTTOM
YOU SHALL LEARN NOTHING FROM ME SAID HE WITH A PASSION SUCH AS I
SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT WAS IN HIS NATURE IF YOU CHOOSE TO CALL THE
POLICE LET THE POLICE FIND WHAT THEY CAN
BY THIS TIME THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS ASTIR FOR I HAD RAISED MY VOICE IN
MY ANGER MARY WAS THE FIRST TO RUSH INTO MY ROOM AND AT THE SIGHT
OF THE CORONET AND OF ARTHURS FACE SHE READ THE WHOLE STORY AND
WITH A SCREAM FELL DOWN SENSELESS ON THE GROUND I SENT THE
HOUSEMAID FOR THE POLICE AND PUT THE INVESTIGATION INTO THEIR HANDS
AT ONCE WHEN THE INSPECTOR AND A CONSTABLE ENTERED THE HOUSE
ARTHUR WHO HAD STOOD SULLENLY WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED ASKED ME WHETHER
IT WAS MY INTENTION TO CHARGE HIM WITH THEFT I ANSWERED THAT IT HAD
CEASED TO BE A PRIVATE MATTER BUT HAD BECOME A PUBLIC ONE SINCE THE
RUINED CORONET WAS NATIONAL PROPERTY I WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LAW
SHOULD HAVE ITS WAY IN EVERYTHING
AT LEAST SAID HE YOU WILL NOT HAVE ME ARRESTED AT ONCE IT
WOULD BE TO YOUR ADVANTAGE AS WELL AS MINE IF I MIGHT LEAVE THE HOUSE
FOR FIVE MINUTES
THAT YOU MAY GET AWAY OR PERHAPS THAT YOU MAY CONCEAL WHAT YOU
HAVE STOLEN SAID I AND THEN REALISING THE DREADFUL POSITION IN
WHICH I WAS PLACED I IMPLORED HIM TO REMEMBER THAT NOT ONLY MY
HONOUR BUT THAT OF ONE WHO WAS FAR GREATER THAN I WAS AT STAKE AND
THAT HE THREATENED TO RAISE A SCANDAL WHICH WOULD CONVULSE THE
NATION HE MIGHT AVERT IT ALL IF HE WOULD BUT TELL ME WHAT HE HAD
DONE WITH THE THREE MISSING STONES
YOU MAY AS WELL FACE THE MATTER SAID I YOU HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN
THE ACT AND NO CONFESSION COULD MAKE YOUR GUILT MORE HEINOUS IF YOU
BUT MAKE SUCH REPARATION AS IS IN YOUR POWER BY TELLING US WHERE THE
BERYLS ARE ALL SHALL BE FORGIVEN AND FORGOTTEN
KEEP YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR THOSE WHO ASK FOR IT HE ANSWERED
TURNING AWAY FROM ME WITH A SNEER I SAW THAT HE WAS TOO HARDENED FOR
ANY WORDS OF MINE TO INFLUENCE HIM THERE WAS BUT ONE WAY FOR IT I
CALLED IN THE INSPECTOR AND GAVE HIM INTO CUSTODY A SEARCH WAS MADE
AT ONCE NOT ONLY OF HIS PERSON BUT OF HIS ROOM AND OF EVERY PORTION
OF THE HOUSE WHERE HE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE CONCEALED THE GEMS BUT NO
TRACE OF THEM COULD BE FOUND NOR WOULD THE WRETCHED BOY OPEN HIS
MOUTH FOR ALL OUR PERSUASIONS AND OUR THREATS THIS MORNING HE WAS
REMOVED TO A CELL AND I AFTER GOING THROUGH ALL THE POLICE
FORMALITIES HAVE HURRIED ROUND TO YOU TO IMPLORE YOU TO USE YOUR
SKILL IN UNRAVELLING THE MATTER THE POLICE HAVE OPENLY CONFESSED
THAT THEY CAN AT PRESENT MAKE NOTHING OF IT YOU MAY GO TO ANY
EXPENSE WHICH YOU THINK NECESSARY I HAVE ALREADY OFFERED A REWARD OF
MY GOD WHAT SHALL I DO I HAVE LOST MY HONOUR MY GEMS AND
MY SON IN ONE NIGHT OH WHAT SHALL I DO
HE PUT A HAND ON EITHER SIDE OF HIS HEAD AND ROCKED HIMSELF TO AND
FRO DRONING TO HIMSELF LIKE A CHILD WHOSE GRIEF HAS GOT BEYOND
WORDS
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT SILENT FOR SOME FEW MINUTES WITH HIS BROWS
KNITTED AND HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE FIRE
DO YOU RECEIVE MUCH COMPANY HE ASKED
NONE SAVE MY PARTNER WITH HIS FAMILY AND AN OCCASIONAL FRIEND OF
ARTHURS SIR GEORGE BURNWELL HAS BEEN SEVERAL TIMES LATELY NO ONE
ELSE I THINK
DO YOU GO OUT MUCH IN SOCIETY
ARTHUR DOES MARY AND I STAY AT HOME WE NEITHER OF US CARE FOR IT
THAT IS UNUSUAL IN A YOUNG GIRL
SHE IS OF A QUIET NATURE BESIDES SHE IS NOT SO VERY YOUNG SHE IS
FOURANDTWENTY
THIS MATTER FROM WHAT YOU SAY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A SHOCK TO HER
ALSO
TERRIBLE SHE IS EVEN MORE AFFECTED THAN I
YOU HAVE NEITHER OF YOU ANY DOUBT AS TO YOUR SONS GUILT
HOW CAN WE HAVE WHEN I SAW HIM WITH MY OWN EYES WITH THE CORONET IN
HIS HANDS
I HARDLY CONSIDER THAT A CONCLUSIVE PROOF WAS THE REMAINDER OF THE
CORONET AT ALL INJURED
YES IT WAS TWISTED
DO YOU NOT THINK THEN THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO STRAIGHTEN
IT
GOD BLESS YOU YOU ARE DOING WHAT YOU CAN FOR HIM AND FOR ME BUT IT
IS TOO HEAVY A TASK WHAT WAS HE DOING THERE AT ALL IF HIS PURPOSE
WERE INNOCENT WHY DID HE NOT SAY SO
PRECISELY AND IF IT WERE GUILTY WHY DID HE NOT INVENT A LIE HIS
SILENCE APPEARS TO ME TO CUT BOTH WAYS THERE ARE SEVERAL SINGULAR
POINTS ABOUT THE CASE WHAT DID THE POLICE THINK OF THE NOISE WHICH
AWOKE YOU FROM YOUR SLEEP
THEY CONSIDERED THAT IT MIGHT BE CAUSED BY ARTHURS CLOSING HIS
BEDROOM DOOR
A LIKELY STORY AS IF A MAN BENT ON FELONY WOULD SLAM HIS DOOR SO AS
TO WAKE A HOUSEHOLD WHAT DID THEY SAY THEN OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF
THESE GEMS
THEY ARE STILL SOUNDING THE PLANKING AND PROBING THE FURNITURE IN
THE HOPE OF FINDING THEM
HAVE THEY THOUGHT OF LOOKING OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
YES THEY HAVE SHOWN EXTRAORDINARY ENERGY THE WHOLE GARDEN HAS
ALREADY BEEN MINUTELY EXAMINED
NOW MY DEAR SIR SAID HOLMES IS IT NOT OBVIOUS TO YOU NOW THAT
THIS MATTER REALLY STRIKES VERY MUCH DEEPER THAN EITHER YOU OR THE
POLICE WERE AT FIRST INCLINED TO THINK IT APPEARED TO YOU TO BE A
SIMPLE CASE TO ME IT SEEMS EXCEEDINGLY COMPLEX CONSIDER WHAT IS
INVOLVED BY YOUR THEORY YOU SUPPOSE THAT YOUR SON CAME DOWN FROM HIS
BED WENT AT GREAT RISK TO YOUR DRESSINGROOM OPENED YOUR BUREAU
TOOK OUT YOUR CORONET BROKE OFF BY MAIN FORCE A SMALL PORTION OF IT
WENT OFF TO SOME OTHER PLACE CONCEALED THREE GEMS OUT OF THE
THIRTYNINE WITH SUCH SKILL THAT NOBODY CAN FIND THEM AND THEN
RETURNED WITH THE OTHER THIRTYSIX INTO THE ROOM IN WHICH HE EXPOSED
HIMSELF TO THE GREATEST DANGER OF BEING DISCOVERED I ASK YOU NOW IS
SUCH A THEORY TENABLE
BUT WHAT OTHER IS THERE CRIED THE BANKER WITH A GESTURE OF
DESPAIR IF HIS MOTIVES WERE INNOCENT WHY DOES HE NOT EXPLAIN
THEM
IT IS OUR TASK TO FIND THAT OUT REPLIED HOLMES SO NOW IF YOU
PLEASE MR HOLDER WE WILL SET OFF FOR STREATHAM TOGETHER AND
DEVOTE AN HOUR TO GLANCING A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY INTO DETAILS
MY FRIEND INSISTED UPON MY ACCOMPANYING THEM IN THEIR EXPEDITION
WHICH I WAS EAGER ENOUGH TO DO FOR MY CURIOSITY AND SYMPATHY WERE
DEEPLY STIRRED BY THE STORY TO WHICH WE HAD LISTENED I CONFESS THAT
THE GUILT OF THE BANKERS SON APPEARED TO ME TO BE AS OBVIOUS AS IT
DID TO HIS UNHAPPY FATHER BUT STILL I HAD SUCH FAITH IN HOLMES
JUDGMENT THAT I FELT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GROUNDS FOR HOPE AS LONG
AS HE WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE ACCEPTED EXPLANATION HE HARDLY SPOKE
A WORD THE WHOLE WAY OUT TO THE SOUTHERN SUBURB BUT SAT WITH HIS
CHIN UPON HIS BREAST AND HIS HAT DRAWN OVER HIS EYES SUNK IN THE
DEEPEST THOUGHT OUR CLIENT APPEARED TO HAVE TAKEN FRESH HEART AT THE
LITTLE GLIMPSE OF HOPE WHICH HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO HIM AND HE EVEN
BROKE INTO A DESULTORY CHAT WITH ME OVER HIS BUSINESS AFFAIRS A
SHORT RAILWAY JOURNEY AND A SHORTER WALK BROUGHT US TO FAIRBANK THE
MODEST RESIDENCE OF THE GREAT FINANCIER
FAIRBANK WAS A GOODSIZED SQUARE HOUSE OF WHITE STONE STANDING BACK
A LITTLE FROM THE ROAD A DOUBLE CARRIAGESWEEP WITH A SNOWCLAD
LAWN STRETCHED DOWN IN FRONT TO TWO LARGE IRON GATES WHICH CLOSED
THE ENTRANCE ON THE RIGHT SIDE WAS A SMALL WOODEN THICKET WHICH LED
INTO A NARROW PATH BETWEEN TWO NEAT HEDGES STRETCHING FROM THE ROAD
TO THE KITCHEN DOOR AND FORMING THE TRADESMENS ENTRANCE ON THE
LEFT RAN A LANE WHICH LED TO THE STABLES AND WAS NOT ITSELF WITHIN
THE GROUNDS AT ALL BEING A PUBLIC THOUGH LITTLE USED THOROUGHFARE
HOLMES LEFT US STANDING AT THE DOOR AND WALKED SLOWLY ALL ROUND THE
HOUSE ACROSS THE FRONT DOWN THE TRADESMENS PATH AND SO ROUND BY
THE GARDEN BEHIND INTO THE STABLE LANE SO LONG WAS HE THAT MR
HOLDER AND I WENT INTO THE DININGROOM AND WAITED BY THE FIRE UNTIL
HE SHOULD RETURN WE WERE SITTING THERE IN SILENCE WHEN THE DOOR
OPENED AND A YOUNG LADY CAME IN SHE WAS RATHER ABOVE THE MIDDLE
HEIGHT SLIM WITH DARK HAIR AND EYES WHICH SEEMED THE DARKER
AGAINST THE ABSOLUTE PALLOR OF HER SKIN I DO NOT THINK THAT I HAVE
EVER SEEN SUCH DEADLY PALENESS IN A WOMANS FACE HER LIPS TOO WERE
BLOODLESS BUT HER EYES WERE FLUSHED WITH CRYING AS SHE SWEPT
SILENTLY INTO THE ROOM SHE IMPRESSED ME WITH A GREATER SENSE OF GRIEF
THAN THE BANKER HAD DONE IN THE MORNING AND IT WAS THE MORE STRIKING
IN HER AS SHE WAS EVIDENTLY A WOMAN OF STRONG CHARACTER WITH IMMENSE
CAPACITY FOR SELFRESTRAINT DISREGARDING MY PRESENCE SHE WENT
STRAIGHT TO HER UNCLE AND PASSED HER HAND OVER HIS HEAD WITH A SWEET
WOMANLY CARESS
YOU HAVE GIVEN ORDERS THAT ARTHUR SHOULD BE LIBERATED HAVE YOU NOT
DAD SHE ASKED
NO NO MY GIRL THE MATTER MUST BE PROBED TO THE BOTTOM
BUT I AM SO SURE THAT HE IS INNOCENT YOU KNOW WHAT WOMANS
INSTINCTS ARE I KNOW THAT HE HAS DONE NO HARM AND THAT YOU WILL BE
SORRY FOR HAVING ACTED SO HARSHLY
WHY IS HE SILENT THEN IF HE IS INNOCENT
WHO KNOWS PERHAPS BECAUSE HE WAS SO ANGRY THAT YOU SHOULD SUSPECT
HIM
HOW COULD I HELP SUSPECTING HIM WHEN I ACTUALLY SAW HIM WITH THE
CORONET IN HIS HAND
OH BUT HE HAD ONLY PICKED IT UP TO LOOK AT IT OH DO DO TAKE MY
WORD FOR IT THAT HE IS INNOCENT LET THE MATTER DROP AND SAY NO MORE
IT IS SO DREADFUL TO THINK OF OUR DEAR ARTHUR IN A PRISON
I SHALL NEVER LET IT DROP UNTIL THE GEMS ARE FOUNDNEVER MARY
YOUR AFFECTION FOR ARTHUR BLINDS YOU AS TO THE AWFUL CONSEQUENCES TO
ME FAR FROM HUSHING THE THING UP I HAVE BROUGHT A GENTLEMAN DOWN
FROM LONDON TO INQUIRE MORE DEEPLY INTO IT
THIS GENTLEMAN SHE ASKED FACING ROUND TO ME
NO HIS FRIEND HE WISHED US TO LEAVE HIM ALONE HE IS ROUND IN THE
STABLE LANE NOW
THE STABLE LANE SHE RAISED HER DARK EYEBROWS WHAT CAN HE HOPE TO
FIND THERE AH THIS I SUPPOSE IS HE I TRUST SIR THAT YOU WILL
SUCCEED IN PROVING WHAT I FEEL SURE IS THE TRUTH THAT MY COUSIN
ARTHUR IS INNOCENT OF THIS CRIME
I FULLY SHARE YOUR OPINION AND I TRUST WITH YOU THAT WE MAY PROVE
IT RETURNED HOLMES GOING BACK TO THE MAT TO KNOCK THE SNOW FROM
HIS SHOES I BELIEVE I HAVE THE HONOUR OF ADDRESSING MISS MARY
HOLDER MIGHT I ASK YOU A QUESTION OR TWO
PRAY DO SIR IF IT MAY HELP TO CLEAR THIS HORRIBLE AFFAIR UP
YOU HEARD NOTHING YOURSELF LAST NIGHT
NOTHING UNTIL MY UNCLE HERE BEGAN TO SPEAK LOUDLY I HEARD THAT
AND I CAME DOWN
YOU SHUT UP THE WINDOWS AND DOORS THE NIGHT BEFORE DID YOU FASTEN
ALL THE WINDOWS
YES
WERE THEY ALL FASTENED THIS MORNING
YES
YOU HAVE A MAID WHO HAS A SWEETHEART I THINK THAT YOU REMARKED TO
YOUR UNCLE LAST NIGHT THAT SHE HAD BEEN OUT TO SEE HIM
YES AND SHE WAS THE GIRL WHO WAITED IN THE DRAWINGROOM AND WHO
MAY HAVE HEARD UNCLES REMARKS ABOUT THE CORONET
I SEE YOU INFER THAT SHE MAY HAVE GONE OUT TO TELL HER SWEETHEART
AND THAT THE TWO MAY HAVE PLANNED THE ROBBERY
BUT WHAT IS THE GOOD OF ALL THESE VAGUE THEORIES CRIED THE BANKER
IMPATIENTLY WHEN I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I SAW ARTHUR WITH THE CORONET
IN HIS HANDS
WAIT A LITTLE MR HOLDER WE MUST COME BACK TO THAT ABOUT THIS
GIRL MISS HOLDER YOU SAW HER RETURN BY THE KITCHEN DOOR I
PRESUME
YES WHEN I WENT TO SEE IF THE DOOR WAS FASTENED FOR THE NIGHT I MET
HER SLIPPING IN I SAW THE MAN TOO IN THE GLOOM
DO YOU KNOW HIM
OH YES HE IS THE GREENGROCER WHO BRINGS OUR VEGETABLES ROUND HIS NAME
IS FRANCIS PROSPER
HE STOOD SAID HOLMES TO THE LEFT OF THE DOORTHAT IS TO SAY
FARTHER UP THE PATH THAN IS NECESSARY TO REACH THE DOOR
YES HE DID
AND HE IS A MAN WITH A WOODEN LEG
SOMETHING LIKE FEAR SPRANG UP IN THE YOUNG LADYS EXPRESSIVE BLACK
EYES WHY YOU ARE LIKE A MAGICIAN SAID SHE HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT SHE SMILED BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWERING SMILE IN HOLMES THIN
EAGER FACE
I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD NOW TO GO UPSTAIRS SAID HE I SHALL
PROBABLY WISH TO GO OVER THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE AGAIN PERHAPS I
HAD BETTER TAKE A LOOK AT THE LOWER WINDOWS BEFORE I GO UP
HE WALKED SWIFTLY ROUND FROM ONE TO THE OTHER PAUSING ONLY AT THE
LARGE ONE WHICH LOOKED FROM THE HALL ONTO THE STABLE LANE THIS HE
OPENED AND MADE A VERY CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE SILL WITH HIS
POWERFUL MAGNIFYING LENS NOW WE SHALL GO UPSTAIRS SAID HE AT
LAST
THE BANKERS DRESSINGROOM WAS A PLAINLY FURNISHED LITTLE CHAMBER
WITH A GREY CARPET A LARGE BUREAU AND A LONG MIRROR HOLMES WENT TO
THE BUREAU FIRST AND LOOKED HARD AT THE LOCK
WHICH KEY WAS USED TO OPEN IT HE ASKED
THAT WHICH MY SON HIMSELF INDICATEDTHAT OF THE CUPBOARD OF THE
LUMBERROOM
HAVE YOU IT HERE
THAT IS IT ON THE DRESSINGTABLE
SHERLOCK HOLMES TOOK IT UP AND OPENED THE BUREAU
IT IS A NOISELESS LOCK SAID HE IT IS NO WONDER THAT IT DID NOT
WAKE YOU THIS CASE I PRESUME CONTAINS THE CORONET WE MUST HAVE A
LOOK AT IT HE OPENED THE CASE AND TAKING OUT THE DIADEM HE LAID IT
UPON THE TABLE IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT SPECIMEN OF THE JEWELLERS ART
AND THE THIRTYSIX STONES WERE THE FINEST THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN AT
ONE SIDE OF THE CORONET WAS A CRACKED EDGE WHERE A CORNER HOLDING
THREE GEMS HAD BEEN TORN AWAY
NOW MR HOLDER SAID HOLMES HERE IS THE CORNER WHICH CORRESPONDS
TO THAT WHICH HAS BEEN SO UNFORTUNATELY LOST MIGHT I BEG THAT YOU
WILL BREAK IT OFF
THE BANKER RECOILED IN HORROR I SHOULD NOT DREAM OF TRYING SAID
HE
THEN I WILL HOLMES SUDDENLY BENT HIS STRENGTH UPON IT BUT WITHOUT
RESULT I FEEL IT GIVE A LITTLE SAID HE BUT THOUGH I AM
EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG IN THE FINGERS IT WOULD TAKE ME ALL MY TIME TO
BREAK IT AN ORDINARY MAN COULD NOT DO IT NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK
WOULD HAPPEN IF I DID BREAK IT MR HOLDER THERE WOULD BE A NOISE
LIKE A PISTOL SHOT DO YOU TELL ME THAT ALL THIS HAPPENED WITHIN A
FEW YARDS OF YOUR BED AND THAT YOU HEARD NOTHING OF IT
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK IT IS ALL DARK TO ME
BUT PERHAPS IT MAY GROW LIGHTER AS WE GO WHAT DO YOU THINK MISS
HOLDER
I CONFESS THAT I STILL SHARE MY UNCLES PERPLEXITY
YOUR SON HAD NO SHOES OR SLIPPERS ON WHEN YOU SAW HIM
HE HAD NOTHING ON SAVE ONLY HIS TROUSERS AND SHIRT
THANK YOU WE HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN FAVOURED WITH EXTRAORDINARY LUCK
DURING THIS INQUIRY AND IT WILL BE ENTIRELY OUR OWN FAULT IF WE DO
NOT SUCCEED IN CLEARING THE MATTER UP WITH YOUR PERMISSION MR
HOLDER I SHALL NOW CONTINUE MY INVESTIGATIONS OUTSIDE
HE WENT ALONE AT HIS OWN REQUEST FOR HE EXPLAINED THAT ANY
UNNECESSARY FOOTMARKS MIGHT MAKE HIS TASK MORE DIFFICULT FOR AN HOUR
OR MORE HE WAS AT WORK RETURNING AT LAST WITH HIS FEET HEAVY WITH
SNOW AND HIS FEATURES AS INSCRUTABLE AS EVER
I THINK THAT I HAVE SEEN NOW ALL THAT THERE IS TO SEE MR HOLDER
SAID HE I CAN SERVE YOU BEST BY RETURNING TO MY ROOMS
BUT THE GEMS MR HOLMES WHERE ARE THEY
I CANNOT TELL
THE BANKER WRUNG HIS HANDS I SHALL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN HE CRIED
AND MY SON YOU GIVE ME HOPES
MY OPINION IS IN NO WAY ALTERED
THEN FOR GODS SAKE WHAT WAS THIS DARK BUSINESS WHICH WAS ACTED IN
MY HOUSE LAST NIGHT
IF YOU CAN CALL UPON ME AT MY BAKER STREET ROOMS TOMORROW MORNING
BETWEEN NINE AND TEN I SHALL BE HAPPY TO DO WHAT I CAN TO MAKE IT
CLEARER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU GIVE ME CARTE BLANCHE TO ACT FOR YOU
PROVIDED ONLY THAT I GET BACK THE GEMS AND THAT YOU PLACE NO LIMIT
ON THE SUM I MAY DRAW
I WOULD GIVE MY FORTUNE TO HAVE THEM BACK
VERY GOOD I SHALL LOOK INTO THE MATTER BETWEEN THIS AND THEN GOODBYE
IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT I MAY HAVE TO COME OVER HERE AGAIN
BEFORE EVENING
IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT MY COMPANIONS MIND WAS NOW MADE UP ABOUT
THE CASE ALTHOUGH WHAT HIS CONCLUSIONS WERE WAS MORE THAN I COULD
EVEN DIMLY IMAGINE SEVERAL TIMES DURING OUR HOMEWARD JOURNEY I
ENDEAVOURED TO SOUND HIM UPON THE POINT BUT HE ALWAYS GLIDED AWAY TO
SOME OTHER TOPIC UNTIL AT LAST I GAVE IT OVER IN DESPAIR IT WAS NOT
YET THREE WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES IN OUR ROOMS ONCE MORE HE HURRIED
TO HIS CHAMBER AND WAS DOWN AGAIN IN A FEW MINUTES DRESSED AS A
COMMON LOAFER WITH HIS COLLAR TURNED UP HIS SHINY SEEDY COAT HIS
RED CRAVAT AND HIS WORN BOOTS HE WAS A PERFECT SAMPLE OF THE CLASS
I THINK THAT THIS SHOULD DO SAID HE GLANCING INTO THE GLASS ABOVE
THE FIREPLACE I ONLY WISH THAT YOU COULD COME WITH ME WATSON BUT
I FEAR THAT IT WONT DO I MAY BE ON THE TRAIL IN THIS MATTER OR I
MAY BE FOLLOWING A WILLOTHEWISP BUT I SHALL SOON KNOW WHICH IT
IS I HOPE THAT I MAY BE BACK IN A FEW HOURS HE CUT A SLICE OF BEEF
FROM THE JOINT UPON THE SIDEBOARD SANDWICHED IT BETWEEN TWO ROUNDS
OF BREAD AND THRUSTING THIS RUDE MEAL INTO HIS POCKET HE STARTED OFF
UPON HIS EXPEDITION
I HAD JUST FINISHED MY TEA WHEN HE RETURNED EVIDENTLY IN EXCELLENT
SPIRITS SWINGING AN OLD ELASTICSIDED BOOT IN HIS HAND HE CHUCKED
IT DOWN INTO A CORNER AND HELPED HIMSELF TO A CUP OF TEA
I ONLY LOOKED IN AS I PASSED SAID HE I AM GOING RIGHT ON
WHERE TO
OH TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WEST END IT MAY BE SOME TIME BEFORE I
GET BACK DONT WAIT UP FOR ME IN CASE I SHOULD BE LATE
HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON
OH SO SO NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF I HAVE BEEN OUT TO STREATHAM
SINCE I SAW YOU LAST BUT I DID NOT CALL AT THE HOUSE IT IS A VERY
SWEET LITTLE PROBLEM AND I WOULD NOT HAVE MISSED IT FOR A GOOD DEAL
HOWEVER I MUST NOT SIT GOSSIPING HERE BUT MUST GET THESE
DISREPUTABLE CLOTHES OFF AND RETURN TO MY HIGHLY RESPECTABLE SELF
I COULD SEE BY HIS MANNER THAT HE HAD STRONGER REASONS FOR
SATISFACTION THAN HIS WORDS ALONE WOULD IMPLY HIS EYES TWINKLED AND
THERE WAS EVEN A TOUCH OF COLOUR UPON HIS SALLOW CHEEKS HE HASTENED
UPSTAIRS AND A FEW MINUTES LATER I HEARD THE SLAM OF THE HALL DOOR
WHICH TOLD ME THAT HE WAS OFF ONCE MORE UPON HIS CONGENIAL HUNT
I WAITED UNTIL MIDNIGHT BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIS RETURN SO I
RETIRED TO MY ROOM IT WAS NO UNCOMMON THING FOR HIM TO BE AWAY FOR
DAYS AND NIGHTS ON END WHEN HE WAS HOT UPON A SCENT SO THAT HIS
LATENESS CAUSED ME NO SURPRISE I DO NOT KNOW AT WHAT HOUR HE CAME
IN BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING THERE HE WAS
WITH A CUP OF COFFEE IN ONE HAND AND THE PAPER IN THE OTHER AS FRESH
AND TRIM AS POSSIBLE
YOU WILL EXCUSE MY BEGINNING WITHOUT YOU WATSON SAID HE BUT YOU
REMEMBER THAT OUR CLIENT HAS RATHER AN EARLY APPOINTMENT THIS
MORNING
WHY IT IS AFTER NINE NOW I ANSWERED I SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED
IF THAT WERE HE I THOUGHT I HEARD A RING
IT WAS INDEED OUR FRIEND THE FINANCIER I WAS SHOCKED BY THE CHANGE
WHICH HAD COME OVER HIM FOR HIS FACE WHICH WAS NATURALLY OF A BROAD
AND MASSIVE MOULD WAS NOW PINCHED AND FALLEN IN WHILE HIS HAIR
SEEMED TO ME AT LEAST A SHADE WHITER HE ENTERED WITH A WEARINESS AND
LETHARGY WHICH WAS EVEN MORE PAINFUL THAN HIS VIOLENCE OF THE MORNING
BEFORE AND HE DROPPED HEAVILY INTO THE ARMCHAIR WHICH I PUSHED
FORWARD FOR HIM
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I HAVE DONE TO BE SO SEVERELY TRIED SAID HE
ONLY TWO DAYS AGO I WAS A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS MAN WITHOUT A CARE
IN THE WORLD NOW I AM LEFT TO A LONELY AND DISHONOURED AGE ONE
SORROW COMES CLOSE UPON THE HEELS OF ANOTHER MY NIECE MARY HAS
DESERTED ME
DESERTED YOU
YES HER BED THIS MORNING HAD NOT BEEN SLEPT IN HER ROOM WAS EMPTY
AND A NOTE FOR ME LAY UPON THE HALL TABLE I HAD SAID TO HER LAST
NIGHT IN SORROW AND NOT IN ANGER THAT IF SHE HAD MARRIED MY BOY ALL
MIGHT HAVE BEEN WELL WITH HIM PERHAPS IT WAS THOUGHTLESS OF ME TO
SAY SO IT IS TO THAT REMARK THAT SHE REFERS IN THIS NOTE
MY DEAREST UNCLE
I FEEL THAT I HAVE BROUGHT TROUBLE UPON YOU AND THAT IF I HAD
ACTED DIFFERENTLY THIS TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE MIGHT NEVER HAVE OCCURRED
I CANNOT WITH THIS THOUGHT IN MY MIND EVER AGAIN BE HAPPY UNDER
YOUR ROOF AND I FEEL THAT I MUST LEAVE YOU FOREVER DO NOT WORRY
ABOUT MY FUTURE FOR THAT IS PROVIDED FOR AND ABOVE ALL DO NOT
SEARCH FOR ME FOR IT WILL BE FRUITLESS LABOUR AND AN ILLSERVICE TO
ME IN LIFE OR IN DEATH I AM EVER
YOUR LOVING
MARY
WHAT COULD SHE MEAN BY THAT NOTE MR HOLMES DO YOU THINK IT POINTS
TO SUICIDE
NO NO NOTHING OF THE KIND IT IS PERHAPS THE BEST POSSIBLE
SOLUTION I TRUST MR HOLDER THAT YOU ARE NEARING THE END OF YOUR
TROUBLES
HA YOU SAY SO YOU HAVE HEARD SOMETHING MR HOLMES YOU HAVE
LEARNED SOMETHING WHERE ARE THE GEMS
YOU WOULD NOT THINK POUNDS APIECE AN EXCESSIVE SUM FOR THEM
I WOULD PAY TEN
THAT WOULD BE UNNECESSARY THREE THOUSAND WILL COVER THE MATTER AND
THERE IS A LITTLE REWARD I FANCY HAVE YOU YOUR CHECKBOOK HERE IS
A PEN BETTER MAKE IT OUT FOR WITH A DAZED FACE THE BANKER MADE OUT THE
REQUIRED CHECK HOLMES
WALKED OVER TO HIS DESK TOOK OUT A LITTLE TRIANGULAR PIECE OF GOLD
WITH THREE GEMS IN IT AND THREW IT DOWN UPON THE TABLE
WITH A SHRIEK OF JOY OUR CLIENT CLUTCHED IT UP
YOU HAVE IT HE GASPED I AM SAVED I AM SAVED
THE REACTION OF JOY WAS AS PASSIONATE AS HIS GRIEF HAD BEEN AND HE
HUGGED HIS RECOVERED GEMS TO HIS BOSOM
THERE IS ONE OTHER THING YOU OWE MR HOLDER SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
RATHER STERNLY
OWE HE CAUGHT UP A PEN NAME THE SUM AND I WILL PAY IT
NO THE DEBT IS NOT TO ME YOU OWE A VERY HUMBLE APOLOGY TO THAT
NOBLE LAD YOUR SON WHO HAS CARRIED HIMSELF IN THIS MATTER AS I
SHOULD BE PROUD TO SEE MY OWN SON DO SHOULD I EVER CHANCE TO HAVE
ONE
THEN IT WAS NOT ARTHUR WHO TOOK THEM
I TOLD YOU YESTERDAY AND I REPEAT TODAY THAT IT WAS NOT
YOU ARE SURE OF IT THEN LET US HURRY TO HIM AT ONCE TO LET HIM KNOW
THAT THE TRUTH IS KNOWN
HE KNOWS IT ALREADY WHEN I HAD CLEARED IT ALL UP I HAD AN INTERVIEW
WITH HIM AND FINDING THAT HE WOULD NOT TELL ME THE STORY I TOLD IT
TO HIM ON WHICH HE HAD TO CONFESS THAT I WAS RIGHT AND TO ADD THE
VERY FEW DETAILS WHICH WERE NOT YET QUITE CLEAR TO ME YOUR NEWS OF
THIS MORNING HOWEVER MAY OPEN HIS LIPS
FOR HEAVENS SAKE TELL ME THEN WHAT IS THIS EXTRAORDINARY
MYSTERY
I WILL DO SO AND I WILL SHOW YOU THE STEPS BY WHICH I REACHED IT
AND LET ME SAY TO YOU FIRST THAT WHICH IT IS HARDEST FOR ME TO SAY
AND FOR YOU TO HEAR THERE HAS BEEN AN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN SIR
GEORGE BURNWELL AND YOUR NIECE MARY THEY HAVE NOW FLED TOGETHER
MY MARY IMPOSSIBLE
IT IS UNFORTUNATELY MORE THAN POSSIBLE IT IS CERTAIN NEITHER YOU
NOR YOUR SON KNEW THE TRUE CHARACTER OF THIS MAN WHEN YOU ADMITTED
HIM INTO YOUR FAMILY CIRCLE HE IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS MEN IN
ENGLANDA RUINED GAMBLER AN ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE VILLAIN A MAN
WITHOUT HEART OR CONSCIENCE YOUR NIECE KNEW NOTHING OF SUCH MEN
WHEN HE BREATHED HIS VOWS TO HER AS HE HAD DONE TO A HUNDRED BEFORE
HER SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHE ALONE HAD TOUCHED HIS HEART THE
DEVIL KNOWS BEST WHAT HE SAID BUT AT LEAST SHE BECAME HIS TOOL AND
WAS IN THE HABIT OF SEEING HIM NEARLY EVERY EVENING
I CANNOT AND I WILL NOT BELIEVE IT CRIED THE BANKER WITH AN
ASHEN FACE
I WILL TELL YOU THEN WHAT OCCURRED IN YOUR HOUSE LAST NIGHT YOUR
NIECE WHEN YOU HAD AS SHE THOUGHT GONE TO YOUR ROOM SLIPPED DOWN
AND TALKED TO HER LOVER THROUGH THE WINDOW WHICH LEADS INTO THE
STABLE LANE HIS FOOTMARKS HAD PRESSED RIGHT THROUGH THE SNOW SO
LONG HAD HE STOOD THERE SHE TOLD HIM OF THE CORONET HIS WICKED LUST
FOR GOLD KINDLED AT THE NEWS AND HE BENT HER TO HIS WILL I HAVE NO
DOUBT THAT SHE LOVED YOU BUT THERE ARE WOMEN IN WHOM THE LOVE OF A
LOVER EXTINGUISHES ALL OTHER LOVES AND I THINK THAT SHE MUST HAVE
BEEN ONE SHE HAD HARDLY LISTENED TO HIS INSTRUCTIONS WHEN SHE SAW
YOU COMING DOWNSTAIRS ON WHICH SHE CLOSED THE WINDOW RAPIDLY AND
TOLD YOU ABOUT ONE OF THE SERVANTS ESCAPADE WITH HER WOODENLEGGED
LOVER WHICH WAS ALL PERFECTLY TRUE
YOUR BOY ARTHUR WENT TO BED AFTER HIS INTERVIEW WITH YOU BUT HE
SLEPT BADLY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS UNEASINESS ABOUT HIS CLUB DEBTS IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT HE HEARD A SOFT TREAD PASS HIS DOOR SO HE ROSE
AND LOOKING OUT WAS SURPRISED TO SEE HIS COUSIN WALKING VERY
STEALTHILY ALONG THE PASSAGE UNTIL SHE DISAPPEARED INTO YOUR
DRESSINGROOM PETRIFIED WITH ASTONISHMENT THE LAD SLIPPED ON SOME
CLOTHES AND WAITED THERE IN THE DARK TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME OF THIS
STRANGE AFFAIR PRESENTLY SHE EMERGED FROM THE ROOM AGAIN AND IN THE
LIGHT OF THE PASSAGELAMP YOUR SON SAW THAT SHE CARRIED THE PRECIOUS
CORONET IN HER HANDS SHE PASSED DOWN THE STAIRS AND HE THRILLING
WITH HORROR RAN ALONG AND SLIPPED BEHIND THE CURTAIN NEAR YOUR DOOR
WHENCE HE COULD SEE WHAT PASSED IN THE HALL BENEATH HE SAW HER
STEALTHILY OPEN THE WINDOW HAND OUT THE CORONET TO SOMEONE IN THE
GLOOM AND THEN CLOSING IT ONCE MORE HURRY BACK TO HER ROOM PASSING
QUITE CLOSE TO WHERE HE STOOD HID BEHIND THE CURTAIN
AS LONG AS SHE WAS ON THE SCENE HE COULD NOT TAKE ANY ACTION WITHOUT
A HORRIBLE EXPOSURE OF THE WOMAN WHOM HE LOVED BUT THE INSTANT THAT
SHE WAS GONE HE REALISED HOW CRUSHING A MISFORTUNE THIS WOULD BE FOR
YOU AND HOW ALLIMPORTANT IT WAS TO SET IT RIGHT HE RUSHED DOWN
JUST AS HE WAS IN HIS BARE FEET OPENED THE WINDOW SPRANG OUT INTO
THE SNOW AND RAN DOWN THE LANE WHERE HE COULD SEE A DARK FIGURE IN
THE MOONLIGHT SIR GEORGE BURNWELL TRIED TO GET AWAY BUT ARTHUR
CAUGHT HIM AND THERE WAS A STRUGGLE BETWEEN THEM YOUR LAD TUGGING
AT ONE SIDE OF THE CORONET AND HIS OPPONENT AT THE OTHER IN THE
SCUFFLE YOUR SON STRUCK SIR GEORGE AND CUT HIM OVER THE EYE THEN
SOMETHING SUDDENLY SNAPPED AND YOUR SON FINDING THAT HE HAD THE
CORONET IN HIS HANDS RUSHED BACK CLOSED THE WINDOW ASCENDED TO
YOUR ROOM AND HAD JUST OBSERVED THAT THE CORONET HAD BEEN TWISTED IN
THE STRUGGLE AND WAS ENDEAVOURING TO STRAIGHTEN IT WHEN YOU APPEARED
UPON THE SCENE
IS IT POSSIBLE GASPED THE BANKER
YOU THEN ROUSED HIS ANGER BY CALLING HIM NAMES AT A MOMENT WHEN HE
FELT THAT HE HAD DESERVED YOUR WARMEST THANKS HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN
THE TRUE STATE OF AFFAIRS WITHOUT BETRAYING ONE WHO CERTAINLY
DESERVED LITTLE ENOUGH CONSIDERATION AT HIS HANDS HE TOOK THE MORE
CHIVALROUS VIEW HOWEVER AND PRESERVED HER SECRET
AND THAT WAS WHY SHE SHRIEKED AND FAINTED WHEN SHE SAW THE CORONET
CRIED MR HOLDER OH MY GOD WHAT A BLIND FOOL I HAVE BEEN AND HIS
ASKING TO BE ALLOWED TO GO OUT FOR FIVE MINUTES THE DEAR FELLOW
WANTED TO SEE IF THE MISSING PIECE WERE AT THE SCENE OF THE STRUGGLE
HOW CRUELLY I HAVE MISJUDGED HIM
WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE CONTINUED HOLMES I AT ONCE WENT VERY
CAREFULLY ROUND IT TO OBSERVE IF THERE WERE ANY TRACES IN THE SNOW
WHICH MIGHT HELP ME I KNEW THAT NONE HAD FALLEN SINCE THE EVENING
BEFORE AND ALSO THAT THERE HAD BEEN A STRONG FROST TO PRESERVE
IMPRESSIONS I PASSED ALONG THE TRADESMENS PATH BUT FOUND IT ALL
TRAMPLED DOWN AND INDISTINGUISHABLE JUST BEYOND IT HOWEVER AT THE
FAR SIDE OF THE KITCHEN DOOR A WOMAN HAD STOOD AND TALKED WITH A
MAN WHOSE ROUND IMPRESSIONS ON ONE SIDE SHOWED THAT HE HAD A WOODEN
LEG I COULD EVEN TELL THAT THEY HAD BEEN DISTURBED FOR THE WOMAN
HAD RUN BACK SWIFTLY TO THE DOOR AS WAS SHOWN BY THE DEEP TOE AND
LIGHT HEEL MARKS WHILE WOODENLEG HAD WAITED A LITTLE AND THEN HAD
GONE AWAY I THOUGHT AT THE TIME THAT THIS MIGHT BE THE MAID AND HER
SWEETHEART OF WHOM YOU HAD ALREADY SPOKEN TO ME AND INQUIRY SHOWED
IT WAS SO I PASSED ROUND THE GARDEN WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHING MORE
THAN RANDOM TRACKS WHICH I TOOK TO BE THE POLICE BUT WHEN I GOT
INTO THE STABLE LANE A VERY LONG AND COMPLEX STORY WAS WRITTEN IN THE
SNOW IN FRONT OF ME
THERE WAS A DOUBLE LINE OF TRACKS OF A BOOTED MAN AND A SECOND
DOUBLE LINE WHICH I SAW WITH DELIGHT BELONGED TO A MAN WITH NAKED
FEET I WAS AT ONCE CONVINCED FROM WHAT YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT THE
LATTER WAS YOUR SON THE FIRST HAD WALKED BOTH WAYS BUT THE OTHER
HAD RUN SWIFTLY AND AS HIS TREAD WAS MARKED IN PLACES OVER THE
DEPRESSION OF THE BOOT IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE HAD PASSED AFTER THE
OTHER I FOLLOWED THEM UP AND FOUND THEY LED TO THE HALL WINDOW
WHERE BOOTS HAD WORN ALL THE SNOW AWAY WHILE WAITING THEN I WALKED
TO THE OTHER END WHICH WAS A HUNDRED YARDS OR MORE DOWN THE LANE I
SAW WHERE BOOTS HAD FACED ROUND WHERE THE SNOW WAS CUT UP AS THOUGH
THERE HAD BEEN A STRUGGLE AND FINALLY WHERE A FEW DROPS OF BLOOD
HAD FALLEN TO SHOW ME THAT I WAS NOT MISTAKEN BOOTS HAD THEN RUN
DOWN THE LANE AND ANOTHER LITTLE SMUDGE OF BLOOD SHOWED THAT IT WAS
HE WHO HAD BEEN HURT WHEN HE CAME TO THE HIGHROAD AT THE OTHER END
I FOUND THAT THE PAVEMENT HAD BEEN CLEARED SO THERE WAS AN END TO
THAT CLUE
ON ENTERING THE HOUSE HOWEVER I EXAMINED AS YOU REMEMBER THE
SILL AND FRAMEWORK OF THE HALL WINDOW WITH MY LENS AND I COULD AT
ONCE SEE THAT SOMEONE HAD PASSED OUT I COULD DISTINGUISH THE OUTLINE
OF AN INSTEP WHERE THE WET FOOT HAD BEEN PLACED IN COMING IN I WAS
THEN BEGINNING TO BE ABLE TO FORM AN OPINION AS TO WHAT HAD OCCURRED
A MAN HAD WAITED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW SOMEONE HAD BROUGHT THE GEMS
THE DEED HAD BEEN OVERSEEN BY YOUR SON HE HAD PURSUED THE THIEF HAD
STRUGGLED WITH HIM THEY HAD EACH TUGGED AT THE CORONET THEIR UNITED
STRENGTH CAUSING INJURIES WHICH NEITHER ALONE COULD HAVE EFFECTED HE
HAD RETURNED WITH THE PRIZE BUT HAD LEFT A FRAGMENT IN THE GRASP OF
HIS OPPONENT SO FAR I WAS CLEAR THE QUESTION NOW WAS WHO WAS THE
MAN AND WHO WAS IT BROUGHT HIM THE CORONET
IT IS AN OLD MAXIM OF MINE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE EXCLUDED THE
IMPOSSIBLE WHATEVER REMAINS HOWEVER IMPROBABLE MUST BE THE TRUTH
NOW I KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT YOU WHO HAD BROUGHT IT DOWN SO THERE
ONLY REMAINED YOUR NIECE AND THE MAIDS BUT IF IT WERE THE MAIDS WHY
SHOULD YOUR SON ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE ACCUSED IN THEIR PLACE THERE
COULD BE NO POSSIBLE REASON AS HE LOVED HIS COUSIN HOWEVER THERE
WAS AN EXCELLENT EXPLANATION WHY HE SHOULD RETAIN HER SECRETTHE
MORE SO AS THE SECRET WAS A DISGRACEFUL ONE WHEN I REMEMBERED THAT
YOU HAD SEEN HER AT THAT WINDOW AND HOW SHE HAD FAINTED ON SEEING
THE CORONET AGAIN MY CONJECTURE BECAME A CERTAINTY
AND WHO COULD IT BE WHO WAS HER CONFEDERATE A LOVER EVIDENTLY FOR
WHO ELSE COULD OUTWEIGH THE LOVE AND GRATITUDE WHICH SHE MUST FEEL TO
YOU I KNEW THAT YOU WENT OUT LITTLE AND THAT YOUR CIRCLE OF FRIENDS
WAS A VERY LIMITED ONE BUT AMONG THEM WAS SIR GEORGE BURNWELL I HAD
HEARD OF HIM BEFORE AS BEING A MAN OF EVIL REPUTATION AMONG WOMEN IT
MUST HAVE BEEN HE WHO WORE THOSE BOOTS AND RETAINED THE MISSING GEMS
EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THAT ARTHUR HAD DISCOVERED HIM HE MIGHT STILL
FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE WAS SAFE FOR THE LAD COULD NOT SAY A WORD
WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS OWN FAMILY
WELL YOUR OWN GOOD SENSE WILL SUGGEST WHAT MEASURES I TOOK NEXT I
WENT IN THE SHAPE OF A LOAFER TO SIR GEORGES HOUSE MANAGED TO PICK
UP AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIS VALET LEARNED THAT HIS MASTER HAD CUT
HIS HEAD THE NIGHT BEFORE AND FINALLY AT THE EXPENSE OF SIX
SHILLINGS MADE ALL SURE BY BUYING A PAIR OF HIS CASTOFF SHOES WITH
THESE I JOURNEYED DOWN TO STREATHAM AND SAW THAT THEY EXACTLY FITTED
THE TRACKS
I SAW AN ILLDRESSED VAGABOND IN THE LANE YESTERDAY EVENING SAID
MR HOLDER
PRECISELY IT WAS I I FOUND THAT I HAD MY MAN SO I CAME HOME AND
CHANGED MY CLOTHES IT WAS A DELICATE PART WHICH I HAD TO PLAY THEN
FOR I SAW THAT A PROSECUTION MUST BE AVOIDED TO AVERT SCANDAL AND I
KNEW THAT SO ASTUTE A VILLAIN WOULD SEE THAT OUR HANDS WERE TIED IN
THE MATTER I WENT AND SAW HIM AT FIRST OF COURSE HE DENIED
EVERYTHING BUT WHEN I GAVE HIM EVERY PARTICULAR THAT HAD OCCURRED
HE TRIED TO BLUSTER AND TOOK DOWN A LIFEPRESERVER FROM THE WALL I
KNEW MY MAN HOWEVER AND I CLAPPED A PISTOL TO HIS HEAD BEFORE HE
COULD STRIKE THEN HE BECAME A LITTLE MORE REASONABLE I TOLD HIM
THAT WE WOULD GIVE HIM A PRICE FOR THE STONES HE HELD APIECE
THAT BROUGHT OUT THE FIRST SIGNS OF GRIEF THAT HE HAD SHOWN WHY
DASH IT ALL SAID HE IVE LET THEM GO AT SIX HUNDRED FOR THE
THREE I SOON MANAGED TO GET THE ADDRESS OF THE RECEIVER WHO HAD
THEM ON PROMISING HIM THAT THERE WOULD BE NO PROSECUTION OFF I SET
TO HIM AND AFTER MUCH CHAFFERING I GOT OUR STONES AT POUNDS
APIECE THEN I LOOKED IN UPON YOUR SON TOLD HIM THAT ALL WAS RIGHT
AND EVENTUALLY GOT TO MY BED ABOUT TWO OCLOCK AFTER WHAT I MAY CALL
A REALLY HARD DAYS WORK
A DAY WHICH HAS SAVED ENGLAND FROM A GREAT PUBLIC SCANDAL SAID THE
BANKER RISING SIR I CANNOT FIND WORDS TO THANK YOU BUT YOU SHALL
NOT FIND ME UNGRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE YOUR SKILL HAS INDEED
EXCEEDED ALL THAT I HAVE HEARD OF IT AND NOW I MUST FLY TO MY DEAR
BOY TO APOLOGISE TO HIM FOR THE WRONG WHICH I HAVE DONE HIM AS TO
WHAT YOU TELL ME OF POOR MARY IT GOES TO MY VERY HEART NOT EVEN
YOUR SKILL CAN INFORM ME WHERE SHE IS NOW
I THINK THAT WE MAY SAFELY SAY RETURNED HOLMES THAT SHE IS
WHEREVER SIR GEORGE BURNWELL IS IT IS EQUALLY CERTAIN TOO THAT
WHATEVER HER SINS ARE THEY WILL SOON RECEIVE A MORE THAN SUFFICIENT
PUNISHMENT
THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
TO THE MAN WHO LOVES ART FOR ITS OWN SAKE REMARKED SHERLOCK
HOLMES TOSSING ASIDE THE ADVERTISEMENT SHEET OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH
IT IS FREQUENTLY IN ITS LEAST IMPORTANT AND LOWLIEST MANIFESTATIONS
THAT THE KEENEST PLEASURE IS TO BE DERIVED IT IS PLEASANT TO ME TO
OBSERVE WATSON THAT YOU HAVE SO FAR GRASPED THIS TRUTH THAT IN
THESE LITTLE RECORDS OF OUR CASES WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO
DRAW UP AND I AM BOUND TO SAY OCCASIONALLY TO EMBELLISH YOU HAVE
GIVEN PROMINENCE NOT SO MUCH TO THE MANY CAUSES CLBRES AND
SENSATIONAL TRIALS IN WHICH I HAVE FIGURED BUT RATHER TO THOSE
INCIDENTS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN TRIVIAL IN THEMSELVES BUT WHICH HAVE
GIVEN ROOM FOR THOSE FACULTIES OF DEDUCTION AND OF LOGICAL SYNTHESIS
WHICH I HAVE MADE MY SPECIAL PROVINCE
AND YET SAID I SMILING I CANNOT QUITE HOLD MYSELF ABSOLVED FROM
THE CHARGE OF SENSATIONALISM WHICH HAS BEEN URGED AGAINST MY
RECORDS
YOU HAVE ERRED PERHAPS HE OBSERVED TAKING UP A GLOWING CINDER
WITH THE TONGS AND LIGHTING WITH IT THE LONG CHERRYWOOD PIPE WHICH
WAS WONT TO REPLACE HIS CLAY WHEN HE WAS IN A DISPUTATIOUS RATHER
THAN A MEDITATIVE MOODYOU HAVE ERRED PERHAPS IN ATTEMPTING TO PUT
COLOUR AND LIFE INTO EACH OF YOUR STATEMENTS INSTEAD OF CONFINING
YOURSELF TO THE TASK OF PLACING UPON RECORD THAT SEVERE REASONING
FROM CAUSE TO EFFECT WHICH IS REALLY THE ONLY NOTABLE FEATURE ABOUT
THE THING
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I HAVE DONE YOU FULL JUSTICE IN THE MATTER I
REMARKED WITH SOME COLDNESS FOR I WAS REPELLED BY THE EGOTISM WHICH
I HAD MORE THAN ONCE OBSERVED TO BE A STRONG FACTOR IN MY FRIENDS
SINGULAR CHARACTER
NO IT IS NOT SELFISHNESS OR CONCEIT SAID HE ANSWERING AS WAS
HIS WONT MY THOUGHTS RATHER THAN MY WORDS IF I CLAIM FULL JUSTICE
FOR MY ART IT IS BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPERSONAL THINGA THING BEYOND
MYSELF CRIME IS COMMON LOGIC IS RARE THEREFORE IT IS UPON THE
LOGIC RATHER THAN UPON THE CRIME THAT YOU SHOULD DWELL YOU HAVE
DEGRADED WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A COURSE OF LECTURES INTO A SERIES OF
TALES
IT WAS A COLD MORNING OF THE EARLY SPRING AND WE SAT AFTER BREAKFAST
ON EITHER SIDE OF A CHEERY FIRE IN THE OLD ROOM AT BAKER STREET A
THICK FOG ROLLED DOWN BETWEEN THE LINES OF DUNCOLOURED HOUSES AND
THE OPPOSING WINDOWS LOOMED LIKE DARK SHAPELESS BLURS THROUGH THE
HEAVY YELLOW WREATHS OUR GAS WAS LIT AND SHONE ON THE WHITE CLOTH
AND GLIMMER OF CHINA AND METAL FOR THE TABLE HAD NOT BEEN CLEARED
YET SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD BEEN SILENT ALL THE MORNING DIPPING
CONTINUOUSLY INTO THE ADVERTISEMENT COLUMNS OF A SUCCESSION OF PAPERS
UNTIL AT LAST HAVING APPARENTLY GIVEN UP HIS SEARCH HE HAD EMERGED
IN NO VERY SWEET TEMPER TO LECTURE ME UPON MY LITERARY SHORTCOMINGS
AT THE SAME TIME HE REMARKED AFTER A PAUSE DURING WHICH HE HAD
SAT PUFFING AT HIS LONG PIPE AND GAZING DOWN INTO THE FIRE YOU CAN
HARDLY BE OPEN TO A CHARGE OF SENSATIONALISM FOR OUT OF THESE CASES
WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN SO KIND AS TO INTEREST YOURSELF IN A FAIR
PROPORTION DO NOT TREAT OF CRIME IN ITS LEGAL SENSE AT ALL THE
SMALL MATTER IN WHICH I ENDEAVOURED TO HELP THE KING OF BOHEMIA THE
SINGULAR EXPERIENCE OF MISS MARY SUTHERLAND THE PROBLEM CONNECTED
WITH THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP AND THE INCIDENT OF THE NOBLE
BACHELOR WERE ALL MATTERS WHICH ARE OUTSIDE THE PALE OF THE LAW BUT
IN AVOIDING THE SENSATIONAL I FEAR THAT YOU MAY HAVE BORDERED ON THE
TRIVIAL
THE END MAY HAVE BEEN SO I ANSWERED BUT THE METHODS I HOLD TO
HAVE BEEN NOVEL AND OF INTEREST
PSHAW MY DEAR FELLOW WHAT DO THE PUBLIC THE GREAT UNOBSERVANT
PUBLIC WHO COULD HARDLY TELL A WEAVER BY HIS TOOTH OR A COMPOSITOR
BY HIS LEFT THUMB CARE ABOUT THE FINER SHADES OF ANALYSIS AND
DEDUCTION BUT INDEED IF YOU ARE TRIVIAL I CANNOT BLAME YOU FOR
THE DAYS OF THE GREAT CASES ARE PAST MAN OR AT LEAST CRIMINAL MAN
HAS LOST ALL ENTERPRISE AND ORIGINALITY AS TO MY OWN LITTLE
PRACTICE IT SEEMS TO BE DEGENERATING INTO AN AGENCY FOR RECOVERING
LOST LEAD PENCILS AND GIVING ADVICE TO YOUNG LADIES FROM
BOARDINGSCHOOLS I THINK THAT I HAVE TOUCHED BOTTOM AT LAST
HOWEVER THIS NOTE I HAD THIS MORNING MARKS MY ZEROPOINT I FANCY
READ IT HE TOSSED A CRUMPLED LETTER ACROSS TO ME
IT WAS DATED FROM MONTAGUE PLACE UPON THE PRECEDING EVENING AND RAN
THUS
DEAR MR HOLMES
I AM VERY ANXIOUS TO CONSULT YOU AS TO WHETHER I SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT
ACCEPT A SITUATION WHICH HAS BEEN OFFERED TO ME AS GOVERNESS I SHALL
CALL AT HALFPAST TEN TOMORROW IF I DO NOT INCONVENIENCE YOU
YOURS FAITHFULLY
VIOLET HUNTER
DO YOU KNOW THE YOUNG LADY I ASKED
NOT I
IT IS HALFPAST TEN NOW
YES AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IS HER RING
IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE OF MORE INTEREST THAN YOU THINK YOU REMEMBER
THAT THE AFFAIR OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE WHICH APPEARED TO BE A MERE
WHIM AT FIRST DEVELOPED INTO A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION IT MAY BE SO
IN THIS CASE ALSO
WELL LET US HOPE SO BUT OUR DOUBTS WILL VERY SOON BE SOLVED FOR
HERE UNLESS I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IS THE PERSON IN QUESTION
AS HE SPOKE THE DOOR OPENED AND A YOUNG LADY ENTERED THE ROOM SHE
WAS PLAINLY BUT NEATLY DRESSED WITH A BRIGHT QUICK FACE FRECKLED
LIKE A PLOVERS EGG AND WITH THE BRISK MANNER OF A WOMAN WHO HAS HAD
HER OWN WAY TO MAKE IN THE WORLD
YOU WILL EXCUSE MY TROUBLING YOU I AM SURE SAID SHE AS MY
COMPANION ROSE TO GREET HER BUT I HAVE HAD A VERY STRANGE
EXPERIENCE AND AS I HAVE NO PARENTS OR RELATIONS OF ANY SORT FROM
WHOM I COULD ASK ADVICE I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS YOU WOULD BE KIND
ENOUGH TO TELL ME WHAT I SHOULD DO
PRAY TAKE A SEAT MISS HUNTER I SHALL BE HAPPY TO DO ANYTHING THAT
I CAN TO SERVE YOU
I COULD SEE THAT HOLMES WAS FAVOURABLY IMPRESSED BY THE MANNER AND
SPEECH OF HIS NEW CLIENT HE LOOKED HER OVER IN HIS SEARCHING
FASHION AND THEN COMPOSED HIMSELF WITH HIS LIDS DROOPING AND HIS
FINGERTIPS TOGETHER TO LISTEN TO HER STORY
I HAVE BEEN A GOVERNESS FOR FIVE YEARS SAID SHE IN THE FAMILY OF
COLONEL SPENCE MUNRO BUT TWO MONTHS AGO THE COLONEL RECEIVED AN
APPOINTMENT AT HALIFAX IN NOVA SCOTIA AND TOOK HIS CHILDREN OVER TO
AMERICA WITH HIM SO THAT I FOUND MYSELF WITHOUT A SITUATION I
ADVERTISED AND I ANSWERED ADVERTISEMENTS BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS AT
LAST THE LITTLE MONEY WHICH I HAD SAVED BEGAN TO RUN SHORT AND I WAS
AT MY WITS END AS TO WHAT I SHOULD DO
THERE IS A WELLKNOWN AGENCY FOR GOVERNESSES IN THE WEST END CALLED
WESTAWAYS AND THERE I USED TO CALL ABOUT ONCE A WEEK IN ORDER TO
SEE WHETHER ANYTHING HAD TURNED UP WHICH MIGHT SUIT ME WESTAWAY WAS
THE NAME OF THE FOUNDER OF THE BUSINESS BUT IT IS REALLY MANAGED BY
MISS STOPER SHE SITS IN HER OWN LITTLE OFFICE AND THE LADIES WHO
ARE SEEKING EMPLOYMENT WAIT IN AN ANTEROOM AND ARE THEN SHOWN IN ONE
BY ONE WHEN SHE CONSULTS HER LEDGERS AND SEES WHETHER SHE HAS
ANYTHING WHICH WOULD SUIT THEM
WELL WHEN I CALLED LAST WEEK I WAS SHOWN INTO THE LITTLE OFFICE AS
USUAL BUT I FOUND THAT MISS STOPER WAS NOT ALONE A PRODIGIOUSLY
STOUT MAN WITH A VERY SMILING FACE AND A GREAT HEAVY CHIN WHICH
ROLLED DOWN IN FOLD UPON FOLD OVER HIS THROAT SAT AT HER ELBOW WITH A
PAIR OF GLASSES ON HIS NOSE LOOKING VERY EARNESTLY AT THE LADIES WHO
ENTERED AS I CAME IN HE GAVE QUITE A JUMP IN HIS CHAIR AND TURNED
QUICKLY TO MISS STOPER
THAT WILL DO SAID HE I COULD NOT ASK FOR ANYTHING BETTER
CAPITAL CAPITAL HE SEEMED QUITE ENTHUSIASTIC AND RUBBED HIS HANDS
TOGETHER IN THE MOST GENIAL FASHION HE WAS SUCH A
COMFORTABLELOOKING MAN THAT IT WAS QUITE A PLEASURE TO LOOK AT HIM
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SITUATION MISS HE ASKED
YES SIR
AS GOVERNESS
YES SIR
AND WHAT SALARY DO YOU ASK
I HAD A MONTH IN MY LAST PLACE WITH COLONEL SPENCE MUNRO
OH TUT TUT SWEATINGRANK SWEATING HE CRIED THROWING HIS FAT
HANDS OUT INTO THE AIR LIKE A MAN WHO IS IN A BOILING PASSION HOW
COULD ANYONE OFFER SO PITIFUL A SUM TO A LADY WITH SUCH ATTRACTIONS
AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS
MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS SIR MAY BE LESS THAN YOU IMAGINE SAID I A
LITTLE FRENCH A LITTLE GERMAN MUSIC AND DRAWING
TUT TUT HE CRIED THIS IS ALL QUITE BESIDE THE QUESTION THE
POINT IS HAVE YOU OR HAVE YOU NOT THE BEARING AND DEPORTMENT OF A
LADY THERE IT IS IN A NUTSHELL IF YOU HAVE NOT YOU ARE NOT FITTED
FOR THE REARING OF A CHILD WHO MAY SOME DAY PLAY A CONSIDERABLE PART
IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY BUT IF YOU HAVE WHY THEN HOW COULD
ANY GENTLEMAN ASK YOU TO CONDESCEND TO ACCEPT ANYTHING UNDER THE
THREE FIGURES YOUR SALARY WITH ME MADAM WOULD COMMENCE AT A
YEAR
YOU MAY IMAGINE MR HOLMES THAT TO ME DESTITUTE AS I WAS SUCH AN
OFFER SEEMED ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THE GENTLEMAN HOWEVER
SEEING PERHAPS THE LOOK OF INCREDULITY UPON MY FACE OPENED A
POCKETBOOK AND TOOK OUT A NOTE
IT IS ALSO MY CUSTOM SAID HE SMILING IN THE MOST PLEASANT
FASHION UNTIL HIS EYES WERE JUST TWO LITTLE SHINING SLITS AMID THE
WHITE CREASES OF HIS FACE TO ADVANCE TO MY YOUNG LADIES HALF THEIR
SALARY BEFOREHAND SO THAT THEY MAY MEET ANY LITTLE EXPENSES OF THEIR
JOURNEY AND THEIR WARDROBE
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NEVER MET SO FASCINATING AND SO
THOUGHTFUL A MAN AS I WAS ALREADY IN DEBT TO MY TRADESMEN THE
ADVANCE WAS A GREAT CONVENIENCE AND YET THERE WAS SOMETHING
UNNATURAL ABOUT THE WHOLE TRANSACTION WHICH MADE ME WISH TO KNOW A
LITTLE MORE BEFORE I QUITE COMMITTED MYSELF
MAY I ASK WHERE YOU LIVE SIR SAID I
HAMPSHIRE CHARMING RURAL PLACE THE COPPER BEECHES FIVE MILES ON
THE FAR SIDE OF WINCHESTER IT IS THE MOST LOVELY COUNTRY MY DEAR
YOUNG LADY AND THE DEAREST OLD COUNTRYHOUSE
AND MY DUTIES SIR I SHOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD BE
ONE CHILDONE DEAR LITTLE ROMPER JUST SIX YEARS OLD OH IF YOU
COULD SEE HIM KILLING COCKROACHES WITH A SLIPPER SMACK SMACK
SMACK THREE GONE BEFORE YOU COULD WINK HE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR
AND LAUGHED HIS EYES INTO HIS HEAD AGAIN
I WAS A LITTLE STARTLED AT THE NATURE OF THE CHILDS AMUSEMENT BUT
THE FATHERS LAUGHTER MADE ME THINK THAT PERHAPS HE WAS JOKING
MY SOLE DUTIES THEN I ASKED ARE TO TAKE CHARGE OF A SINGLE
CHILD
NO NO NOT THE SOLE NOT THE SOLE MY DEAR YOUNG LADY HE CRIED
YOUR DUTY WOULD BE AS I AM SURE YOUR GOOD SENSE WOULD SUGGEST TO
OBEY ANY LITTLE COMMANDS MY WIFE MIGHT GIVE PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT
THEY WERE SUCH COMMANDS AS A LADY MIGHT WITH PROPRIETY OBEY YOU SEE
NO DIFFICULTY HEH
I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL
QUITE SO IN DRESS NOW FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE FADDY PEOPLE YOU
KNOWFADDY BUT KINDHEARTED IF YOU WERE ASKED TO WEAR ANY DRESS
WHICH WE MIGHT GIVE YOU YOU WOULD NOT OBJECT TO OUR LITTLE WHIM
HEH
NO SAID I CONSIDERABLY ASTONISHED AT HIS WORDS
OR TO SIT HERE OR SIT THERE THAT WOULD NOT BE OFFENSIVE TO YOU
OH NO
OR TO CUT YOUR HAIR QUITE SHORT BEFORE YOU COME TO US
I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY EARS AS YOU MAY OBSERVE MR HOLMES MY
HAIR IS SOMEWHAT LUXURIANT AND OF A RATHER PECULIAR TINT OF
CHESTNUT IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED ARTISTIC I COULD NOT DREAM OF
SACRIFICING IT IN THIS OFFHAND FASHION
I AM AFRAID THAT THAT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE SAID I HE HAD BEEN
WATCHING ME EAGERLY OUT OF HIS SMALL EYES AND I COULD SEE A SHADOW
PASS OVER HIS FACE AS I SPOKE
I AM AFRAID THAT IT IS QUITE ESSENTIAL SAID HE IT IS A LITTLE
FANCY OF MY WIFES AND LADIES FANCIES YOU KNOW MADAM LADIES
FANCIES MUST BE CONSULTED AND SO YOU WONT CUT YOUR HAIR
NO SIR I REALLY COULD NOT I ANSWERED FIRMLY
AH VERY WELL THEN THAT QUITE SETTLES THE MATTER IT IS A PITY
BECAUSE IN OTHER RESPECTS YOU WOULD REALLY HAVE DONE VERY NICELY IN
THAT CASE MISS STOPER I HAD BEST INSPECT A FEW MORE OF YOUR YOUNG
LADIES
THE MANAGERESS HAD SAT ALL THIS WHILE BUSY WITH HER PAPERS WITHOUT A
WORD TO EITHER OF US BUT SHE GLANCED AT ME NOW WITH SO MUCH
ANNOYANCE UPON HER FACE THAT I COULD NOT HELP SUSPECTING THAT SHE HAD
LOST A HANDSOME COMMISSION THROUGH MY REFUSAL
DO YOU DESIRE YOUR NAME TO BE KEPT UPON THE BOOKS SHE ASKED
IF YOU PLEASE MISS STOPER
WELL REALLY IT SEEMS RATHER USELESS SINCE YOU REFUSE THE MOST
EXCELLENT OFFERS IN THIS FASHION SAID SHE SHARPLY YOU CAN HARDLY
EXPECT US TO EXERT OURSELVES TO FIND ANOTHER SUCH OPENING FOR YOU
GOODDAY TO YOU MISS HUNTER SHE STRUCK A GONG UPON THE TABLE AND
I WAS SHOWN OUT BY THE PAGE
WELL MR HOLMES WHEN I GOT BACK TO MY LODGINGS AND FOUND LITTLE
ENOUGH IN THE CUPBOARD AND TWO OR THREE BILLS UPON THE TABLE I
BEGAN TO ASK MYSELF WHETHER I HAD NOT DONE A VERY FOOLISH THING
AFTER ALL IF THESE PEOPLE HAD STRANGE FADS AND EXPECTED OBEDIENCE ON
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY MATTERS THEY WERE AT LEAST READY TO PAY FOR
THEIR ECCENTRICITY VERY FEW GOVERNESSES IN ENGLAND ARE GETTING A YEAR
BESIDES WHAT USE WAS MY HAIR TO ME MANY PEOPLE ARE IMPROVED
BY WEARING IT SHORT AND PERHAPS I SHOULD BE AMONG THE NUMBER NEXT
DAY I WAS INCLINED TO THINK THAT I HAD MADE A MISTAKE AND BY THE DAY
AFTER I WAS SURE OF IT I HAD ALMOST OVERCOME MY PRIDE SO FAR AS TO
GO BACK TO THE AGENCY AND INQUIRE WHETHER THE PLACE WAS STILL OPEN
WHEN I RECEIVED THIS LETTER FROM THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF I HAVE IT
HERE AND I WILL READ IT TO YOU
THE COPPER BEECHES NEAR WINCHESTER
DEAR MISS HUNTER
MISS STOPER HAS VERY KINDLY GIVEN ME YOUR ADDRESS AND I WRITE FROM
HERE TO ASK YOU WHETHER YOU HAVE RECONSIDERED YOUR DECISION MY WIFE
IS VERY ANXIOUS THAT YOU SHOULD COME FOR SHE HAS BEEN MUCH ATTRACTED
BY MY DESCRIPTION OF YOU WE ARE WILLING TO GIVE A QUARTER OR
A YEAR SO AS TO RECOMPENSE YOU FOR ANY LITTLE INCONVENIENCE
WHICH OUR FADS MAY CAUSE YOU THEY ARE NOT VERY EXACTING AFTER ALL
MY WIFE IS FOND OF A PARTICULAR SHADE OF ELECTRIC BLUE AND WOULD LIKE
YOU TO WEAR SUCH A DRESS INDOORS IN THE MORNING YOU NEED NOT
HOWEVER GO TO THE EXPENSE OF PURCHASING ONE AS WE HAVE ONE
BELONGING TO MY DEAR DAUGHTER ALICE NOW IN PHILADELPHIA WHICH
WOULD I SHOULD THINK FIT YOU VERY WELL THEN AS TO SITTING HERE OR
THERE OR AMUSING YOURSELF IN ANY MANNER INDICATED THAT NEED CAUSE
YOU NO INCONVENIENCE AS REGARDS YOUR HAIR IT IS NO DOUBT A PITY
ESPECIALLY AS I COULD NOT HELP REMARKING ITS BEAUTY DURING OUR SHORT
INTERVIEW BUT I AM AFRAID THAT I MUST REMAIN FIRM UPON THIS POINT
AND I ONLY HOPE THAT THE INCREASED SALARY MAY RECOMPENSE YOU FOR THE
LOSS YOUR DUTIES AS FAR AS THE CHILD IS CONCERNED ARE VERY LIGHT
NOW DO TRY TO COME AND I SHALL MEET YOU WITH THE DOGCART AT
WINCHESTER LET ME KNOW YOUR TRAIN
YOURS FAITHFULLY
JEPHRO RUCASTLE
THAT IS THE LETTER WHICH I HAVE JUST RECEIVED MR HOLMES AND MY
MIND IS MADE UP THAT I WILL ACCEPT IT I THOUGHT HOWEVER THAT
BEFORE TAKING THE FINAL STEP I SHOULD LIKE TO SUBMIT THE WHOLE MATTER
TO YOUR CONSIDERATION
WELL MISS HUNTER IF YOUR MIND IS MADE UP THAT SETTLES THE
QUESTION SAID HOLMES SMILING
BUT YOU WOULD NOT ADVISE ME TO REFUSE
I CONFESS THAT IT IS NOT THE SITUATION WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE A
SISTER OF MINE APPLY FOR
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF IT ALL MR HOLMES
AH I HAVE NO DATA I CANNOT TELL PERHAPS YOU HAVE YOURSELF FORMED
SOME OPINION
WELL THERE SEEMS TO ME TO BE ONLY ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION MR
RUCASTLE SEEMED TO BE A VERY KIND GOODNATURED MAN IS IT NOT
POSSIBLE THAT HIS WIFE IS A LUNATIC THAT HE DESIRES TO KEEP THE
MATTER QUIET FOR FEAR SHE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO AN ASYLUM AND THAT HE
HUMOURS HER FANCIES IN EVERY WAY IN ORDER TO PREVENT AN OUTBREAK
THAT IS A POSSIBLE SOLUTIONIN FACT AS MATTERS STAND IT IS THE
MOST PROBABLE ONE BUT IN ANY CASE IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A NICE
HOUSEHOLD FOR A YOUNG LADY
BUT THE MONEY MR HOLMES THE MONEY
WELL YES OF COURSE THE PAY IS GOODTOO GOOD THAT IS WHAT MAKES
ME UNEASY WHY SHOULD THEY GIVE YOU A YEAR WHEN THEY COULD HAVE
THEIR PICK FOR THERE MUST BE SOME STRONG REASON BEHIND
I THOUGHT THAT IF I TOLD YOU THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND
AFTERWARDS IF I WANTED YOUR HELP I SHOULD FEEL SO MUCH STRONGER IF I
FELT THAT YOU WERE AT THE BACK OF ME
OH YOU MAY CARRY THAT FEELING AWAY WITH YOU I ASSURE YOU THAT YOUR
LITTLE PROBLEM PROMISES TO BE THE MOST INTERESTING WHICH HAS COME MY
WAY FOR SOME MONTHS THERE IS SOMETHING DISTINCTLY NOVEL ABOUT SOME
OF THE FEATURES IF YOU SHOULD FIND YOURSELF IN DOUBT OR IN DANGER
DANGER WHAT DANGER DO YOU FORESEE
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVELY IT WOULD CEASE TO BE A DANGER IF WE
COULD DEFINE IT SAID HE BUT AT ANY TIME DAY OR NIGHT A TELEGRAM
WOULD BRING ME DOWN TO YOUR HELP
THAT IS ENOUGH SHE ROSE BRISKLY FROM HER CHAIR WITH THE ANXIETY
ALL SWEPT FROM HER FACE I SHALL GO DOWN TO HAMPSHIRE QUITE EASY IN
MY MIND NOW I SHALL WRITE TO MR RUCASTLE AT ONCE SACRIFICE MY POOR
HAIR TONIGHT AND START FOR WINCHESTER TOMORROW WITH A FEW
GRATEFUL WORDS TO HOLMES SHE BADE US BOTH GOODNIGHT AND BUSTLED OFF
UPON HER WAY
AT LEAST SAID I AS WE HEARD HER QUICK FIRM STEPS DESCENDING THE
STAIRS SHE SEEMS TO BE A YOUNG LADY WHO IS VERY WELL ABLE TO TAKE
CARE OF HERSELF
AND SHE WOULD NEED TO BE SAID HOLMES GRAVELY I AM MUCH MISTAKEN
IF WE DO NOT HEAR FROM HER BEFORE MANY DAYS ARE PAST
IT WAS NOT VERY LONG BEFORE MY FRIENDS PREDICTION WAS FULFILLED A
FORTNIGHT WENT BY DURING WHICH I FREQUENTLY FOUND MY THOUGHTS
TURNING IN HER DIRECTION AND WONDERING WHAT STRANGE SIDEALLEY OF
HUMAN EXPERIENCE THIS LONELY WOMAN HAD STRAYED INTO THE UNUSUAL
SALARY THE CURIOUS CONDITIONS THE LIGHT DUTIES ALL POINTED TO
SOMETHING ABNORMAL THOUGH WHETHER A FAD OR A PLOT OR WHETHER THE
MAN WERE A PHILANTHROPIST OR A VILLAIN IT WAS QUITE BEYOND MY POWERS
TO DETERMINE AS TO HOLMES I OBSERVED THAT HE SAT FREQUENTLY FOR
HALF AN HOUR ON END WITH KNITTED BROWS AND AN ABSTRACTED AIR BUT HE
SWEPT THE MATTER AWAY WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND WHEN I MENTIONED IT
DATA DATA DATA HE CRIED IMPATIENTLY I CANT MAKE BRICKS
WITHOUT CLAY AND YET HE WOULD ALWAYS WIND UP BY MUTTERING THAT NO
SISTER OF HIS SHOULD EVER HAVE ACCEPTED SUCH A SITUATION
THE TELEGRAM WHICH WE EVENTUALLY RECEIVED CAME LATE ONE NIGHT JUST AS
I WAS THINKING OF TURNING IN AND HOLMES WAS SETTLING DOWN TO ONE OF
THOSE ALLNIGHT CHEMICAL RESEARCHES WHICH HE FREQUENTLY INDULGED IN
WHEN I WOULD LEAVE HIM STOOPING OVER A RETORT AND A TESTTUBE AT
NIGHT AND FIND HIM IN THE SAME POSITION WHEN I CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST
IN THE MORNING HE OPENED THE YELLOW ENVELOPE AND THEN GLANCING AT
THE MESSAGE THREW IT ACROSS TO ME
JUST LOOK UP THE TRAINS IN BRADSHAW SAID HE AND TURNED BACK TO
HIS CHEMICAL STUDIES
THE SUMMONS WAS A BRIEF AND URGENT ONE
PLEASE BE AT THE BLACK SWAN HOTEL AT WINCHESTER AT MIDDAY TOMORROW
IT SAID DO COME I AM AT MY WITS END
HUNTER
WILL YOU COME WITH ME ASKED HOLMES GLANCING UP
I SHOULD WISH TO
JUST LOOK IT UP THEN
THERE IS A TRAIN AT HALFPAST NINE SAID I GLANCING OVER MY
BRADSHAW IT IS DUE AT WINCHESTER AT THAT WILL DO VERY NICELY THEN
PERHAPS I HAD BETTER POSTPONE MY
ANALYSIS OF THE ACETONES AS WE MAY NEED TO BE AT OUR BEST IN THE
MORNING
BY ELEVEN OCLOCK THE NEXT DAY WE WERE WELL UPON OUR WAY TO THE OLD
ENGLISH CAPITAL HOLMES HAD BEEN BURIED IN THE MORNING PAPERS ALL THE
WAY DOWN BUT AFTER WE HAD PASSED THE HAMPSHIRE BORDER HE THREW THEM
DOWN AND BEGAN TO ADMIRE THE SCENERY IT WAS AN IDEAL SPRING DAY A
LIGHT BLUE SKY FLECKED WITH LITTLE FLEECY WHITE CLOUDS DRIFTING
ACROSS FROM WEST TO EAST THE SUN WAS SHINING VERY BRIGHTLY AND YET
THERE WAS AN EXHILARATING NIP IN THE AIR WHICH SET AN EDGE TO A
MANS ENERGY ALL OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE AWAY TO THE ROLLING HILLS
AROUND ALDERSHOT THE LITTLE RED AND GREY ROOFS OF THE FARMSTEADINGS
PEEPED OUT FROM AMID THE LIGHT GREEN OF THE NEW FOLIAGE
ARE THEY NOT FRESH AND BEAUTIFUL I CRIED WITH ALL THE ENTHUSIASM
OF A MAN FRESH FROM THE FOGS OF BAKER STREET
BUT HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVELY
DO YOU KNOW WATSON SAID HE THAT IT IS ONE OF THE CURSES OF A
MIND WITH A TURN LIKE MINE THAT I MUST LOOK AT EVERYTHING WITH
REFERENCE TO MY OWN SPECIAL SUBJECT YOU LOOK AT THESE SCATTERED
HOUSES AND YOU ARE IMPRESSED BY THEIR BEAUTY I LOOK AT THEM AND
THE ONLY THOUGHT WHICH COMES TO ME IS A FEELING OF THEIR ISOLATION
AND OF THE IMPUNITY WITH WHICH CRIME MAY BE COMMITTED THERE
GOOD HEAVENS I CRIED WHO WOULD ASSOCIATE CRIME WITH THESE DEAR
OLD HOMESTEADS
THEY ALWAYS FILL ME WITH A CERTAIN HORROR IT IS MY BELIEF WATSON
FOUNDED UPON MY EXPERIENCE THAT THE LOWEST AND VILEST ALLEYS IN
LONDON DO NOT PRESENT A MORE DREADFUL RECORD OF SIN THAN DOES THE
SMILING AND BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE
YOU HORRIFY ME
BUT THE REASON IS VERY OBVIOUS THE PRESSURE OF PUBLIC OPINION CAN
DO IN THE TOWN WHAT THE LAW CANNOT ACCOMPLISH THERE IS NO LANE SO
VILE THAT THE SCREAM OF A TORTURED CHILD OR THE THUD OF A DRUNKARDS
BLOW DOES NOT BEGET SYMPATHY AND INDIGNATION AMONG THE NEIGHBOURS
AND THEN THE WHOLE MACHINERY OF JUSTICE IS EVER SO CLOSE THAT A WORD
OF COMPLAINT CAN SET IT GOING AND THERE IS BUT A STEP BETWEEN THE
CRIME AND THE DOCK BUT LOOK AT THESE LONELY HOUSES EACH IN ITS OWN
FIELDS FILLED FOR THE MOST PART WITH POOR IGNORANT FOLK WHO KNOW
LITTLE OF THE LAW THINK OF THE DEEDS OF HELLISH CRUELTY THE HIDDEN
WICKEDNESS WHICH MAY GO ON YEAR IN YEAR OUT IN SUCH PLACES AND
NONE THE WISER HAD THIS LADY WHO APPEALS TO US FOR HELP GONE TO LIVE
IN WINCHESTER I SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD A FEAR FOR HER IT IS THE FIVE
MILES OF COUNTRY WHICH MAKES THE DANGER STILL IT IS CLEAR THAT SHE
IS NOT PERSONALLY THREATENED
NO IF SHE CAN COME TO WINCHESTER TO MEET US SHE CAN GET AWAY
QUITE SO SHE HAS HER FREEDOM
WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER THEN CAN YOU SUGGEST NO EXPLANATION
I HAVE DEVISED SEVEN SEPARATE EXPLANATIONS EACH OF WHICH WOULD
COVER THE FACTS AS FAR AS WE KNOW THEM BUT WHICH OF THESE IS CORRECT
CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED BY THE FRESH INFORMATION WHICH WE SHALL NO
DOUBT FIND WAITING FOR US WELL THERE IS THE TOWER OF THE CATHEDRAL
AND WE SHALL SOON LEARN ALL THAT MISS HUNTER HAS TO TELL
THE BLACK SWAN IS AN INN OF REPUTE IN THE HIGH STREET AT NO DISTANCE
FROM THE STATION AND THERE WE FOUND THE YOUNG LADY WAITING FOR US
SHE HAD ENGAGED A SITTINGROOM AND OUR LUNCH AWAITED US UPON THE
TABLE
I AM SO DELIGHTED THAT YOU HAVE COME SHE SAID EARNESTLY IT IS SO
VERY KIND OF YOU BOTH BUT INDEED I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO
YOUR ADVICE WILL BE ALTOGETHER INVALUABLE TO ME
PRAY TELL US WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
I WILL DO SO AND I MUST BE QUICK FOR I HAVE PROMISED MR RUCASTLE
TO BE BACK BEFORE THREE I GOT HIS LEAVE TO COME INTO TOWN THIS
MORNING THOUGH HE LITTLE KNEW FOR WHAT PURPOSE
LET US HAVE EVERYTHING IN ITS DUE ORDER HOLMES THRUST HIS LONG
THIN LEGS OUT TOWARDS THE FIRE AND COMPOSED HIMSELF TO LISTEN
IN THE FIRST PLACE I MAY SAY THAT I HAVE MET ON THE WHOLE WITH NO
ACTUAL ILLTREATMENT FROM MR AND MRS RUCASTLE IT IS ONLY FAIR TO
THEM TO SAY THAT BUT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND THEM AND I AM NOT EASY IN
MY MIND ABOUT THEM
WHAT CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND
THEIR REASONS FOR THEIR CONDUCT BUT YOU SHALL HAVE IT ALL JUST AS
IT OCCURRED WHEN I CAME DOWN MR RUCASTLE MET ME HERE AND DROVE ME
IN HIS DOGCART TO THE COPPER BEECHES IT IS AS HE SAID BEAUTIFULLY
SITUATED BUT IT IS NOT BEAUTIFUL IN ITSELF FOR IT IS A LARGE SQUARE
BLOCK OF A HOUSE WHITEWASHED BUT ALL STAINED AND STREAKED WITH DAMP
AND BAD WEATHER THERE ARE GROUNDS ROUND IT WOODS ON THREE SIDES
AND ON THE FOURTH A FIELD WHICH SLOPES DOWN TO THE SOUTHAMPTON
HIGHROAD WHICH CURVES PAST ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE FRONT
DOOR THIS GROUND IN FRONT BELONGS TO THE HOUSE BUT THE WOODS ALL
ROUND ARE PART OF LORD SOUTHERTONS PRESERVES A CLUMP OF COPPER
BEECHES IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE HALL DOOR HAS GIVEN ITS NAME TO
THE PLACE
I WAS DRIVEN OVER BY MY EMPLOYER WHO WAS AS AMIABLE AS EVER AND
WAS INTRODUCED BY HIM THAT EVENING TO HIS WIFE AND THE CHILD THERE
WAS NO TRUTH MR HOLMES IN THE CONJECTURE WHICH SEEMED TO US TO BE
PROBABLE IN YOUR ROOMS AT BAKER STREET MRS RUCASTLE IS NOT MAD I
FOUND HER TO BE A SILENT PALEFACED WOMAN MUCH YOUNGER THAN HER
HUSBAND NOT MORE THAN THIRTY I SHOULD THINK WHILE HE CAN HARDLY BE
LESS THAN FORTYFIVE FROM THEIR CONVERSATION I HAVE GATHERED THAT
THEY HAVE BEEN MARRIED ABOUT SEVEN YEARS THAT HE WAS A WIDOWER AND
THAT HIS ONLY CHILD BY THE FIRST WIFE WAS THE DAUGHTER WHO HAS GONE
TO PHILADELPHIA MR RUCASTLE TOLD ME IN PRIVATE THAT THE REASON WHY
SHE HAD LEFT THEM WAS THAT SHE HAD AN UNREASONING AVERSION TO HER
STEPMOTHER AS THE DAUGHTER COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LESS THAN TWENTY I
CAN QUITE IMAGINE THAT HER POSITION MUST HAVE BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE WITH
HER FATHERS YOUNG WIFE
MRS RUCASTLE SEEMED TO ME TO BE COLOURLESS IN MIND AS WELL AS IN
FEATURE SHE IMPRESSED ME NEITHER FAVOURABLY NOR THE REVERSE SHE WAS
A NONENTITY IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT SHE WAS PASSIONATELY DEVOTED
BOTH TO HER HUSBAND AND TO HER LITTLE SON HER LIGHT GREY EYES
WANDERED CONTINUALLY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER NOTING EVERY LITTLE WANT
AND FORESTALLING IT IF POSSIBLE HE WAS KIND TO HER ALSO IN HIS
BLUFF BOISTEROUS FASHION AND ON THE WHOLE THEY SEEMED TO BE A HAPPY
COUPLE AND YET SHE HAD SOME SECRET SORROW THIS WOMAN SHE WOULD
OFTEN BE LOST IN DEEP THOUGHT WITH THE SADDEST LOOK UPON HER FACE
MORE THAN ONCE I HAVE SURPRISED HER IN TEARS I HAVE THOUGHT
SOMETIMES THAT IT WAS THE DISPOSITION OF HER CHILD WHICH WEIGHED UPON
HER MIND FOR I HAVE NEVER MET SO UTTERLY SPOILED AND SO ILLNATURED
A LITTLE CREATURE HE IS SMALL FOR HIS AGE WITH A HEAD WHICH IS
QUITE DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE HIS WHOLE LIFE APPEARS TO BE SPENT IN
AN ALTERNATION BETWEEN SAVAGE FITS OF PASSION AND GLOOMY INTERVALS OF
SULKING GIVING PAIN TO ANY CREATURE WEAKER THAN HIMSELF SEEMS TO BE
HIS ONE IDEA OF AMUSEMENT AND HE SHOWS QUITE REMARKABLE TALENT IN
PLANNING THE CAPTURE OF MICE LITTLE BIRDS AND INSECTS BUT I WOULD
RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT THE CREATURE MR HOLMES AND INDEED HE HAS
LITTLE TO DO WITH MY STORY
I AM GLAD OF ALL DETAILS REMARKED MY FRIEND WHETHER THEY SEEM TO
YOU TO BE RELEVANT OR NOT
I SHALL TRY NOT TO MISS ANYTHING OF IMPORTANCE THE ONE UNPLEASANT
THING ABOUT THE HOUSE WHICH STRUCK ME AT ONCE WAS THE APPEARANCE
AND CONDUCT OF THE SERVANTS THERE ARE ONLY TWO A MAN AND HIS WIFE
TOLLER FOR THAT IS HIS NAME IS A ROUGH UNCOUTH MAN WITH GRIZZLED
HAIR AND WHISKERS AND A PERPETUAL SMELL OF DRINK TWICE SINCE I HAVE
BEEN WITH THEM HE HAS BEEN QUITE DRUNK AND YET MR RUCASTLE SEEMED
TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF IT HIS WIFE IS A VERY TALL AND STRONG WOMAN
WITH A SOUR FACE AS SILENT AS MRS RUCASTLE AND MUCH LESS AMIABLE
THEY ARE A MOST UNPLEASANT COUPLE BUT FORTUNATELY I SPEND MOST OF MY
TIME IN THE NURSERY AND MY OWN ROOM WHICH ARE NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN
ONE CORNER OF THE BUILDING
FOR TWO DAYS AFTER MY ARRIVAL AT THE COPPER BEECHES MY LIFE WAS VERY
QUIET ON THE THIRD MRS RUCASTLE CAME DOWN JUST AFTER BREAKFAST AND
WHISPERED SOMETHING TO HER HUSBAND
OH YES SAID HE TURNING TO ME WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
MISS HUNTER FOR FALLING IN WITH OUR WHIMS SO FAR AS TO CUT YOUR
HAIR I ASSURE YOU THAT IT HAS NOT DETRACTED IN THE TINIEST IOTA FROM
YOUR APPEARANCE WE SHALL NOW SEE HOW THE ELECTRICBLUE DRESS WILL
BECOME YOU YOU WILL FIND IT LAID OUT UPON THE BED IN YOUR ROOM AND
IF YOU WOULD BE SO GOOD AS TO PUT IT ON WE SHOULD BOTH BE EXTREMELY
OBLIGED
THE DRESS WHICH I FOUND WAITING FOR ME WAS OF A PECULIAR SHADE OF
BLUE IT WAS OF EXCELLENT MATERIAL A SORT OF BEIGE BUT IT BORE
UNMISTAKABLE SIGNS OF HAVING BEEN WORN BEFORE IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN
A BETTER FIT IF I HAD BEEN MEASURED FOR IT BOTH MR AND MRS
RUCASTLE EXPRESSED A DELIGHT AT THE LOOK OF IT WHICH SEEMED QUITE
EXAGGERATED IN ITS VEHEMENCE THEY WERE WAITING FOR ME IN THE
DRAWINGROOM WHICH IS A VERY LARGE ROOM STRETCHING ALONG THE ENTIRE
FRONT OF THE HOUSE WITH THREE LONG WINDOWS REACHING DOWN TO THE
FLOOR A CHAIR HAD BEEN PLACED CLOSE TO THE CENTRAL WINDOW WITH ITS
BACK TURNED TOWARDS IT IN THIS I WAS ASKED TO SIT AND THEN MR
RUCASTLE WALKING UP AND DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM BEGAN TO
TELL ME A SERIES OF THE FUNNIEST STORIES THAT I HAVE EVER LISTENED
TO YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW COMICAL HE WAS AND I LAUGHED UNTIL I WAS
QUITE WEARY MRS RUCASTLE HOWEVER WHO HAS EVIDENTLY NO SENSE OF
HUMOUR NEVER SO MUCH AS SMILED BUT SAT WITH HER HANDS IN HER LAP
AND A SAD ANXIOUS LOOK UPON HER FACE AFTER AN HOUR OR SO MR
RUCASTLE SUDDENLY REMARKED THAT IT WAS TIME TO COMMENCE THE DUTIES OF
THE DAY AND THAT I MIGHT CHANGE MY DRESS AND GO TO LITTLE EDWARD IN
THE NURSERY
TWO DAYS LATER THIS SAME PERFORMANCE WAS GONE THROUGH UNDER EXACTLY
SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES AGAIN I CHANGED MY DRESS AGAIN I SAT IN THE
WINDOW AND AGAIN I LAUGHED VERY HEARTILY AT THE FUNNY STORIES OF
WHICH MY EMPLOYER HAD AN IMMENSE RPERTOIRE AND WHICH HE TOLD
INIMITABLY THEN HE HANDED ME A YELLOWBACKED NOVEL AND MOVING MY
CHAIR A LITTLE SIDEWAYS THAT MY OWN SHADOW MIGHT NOT FALL UPON THE
PAGE HE BEGGED ME TO READ ALOUD TO HIM I READ FOR ABOUT TEN
MINUTES BEGINNING IN THE HEART OF A CHAPTER AND THEN SUDDENLY IN
THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE HE ORDERED ME TO CEASE AND TO CHANGE MY
DRESS
YOU CAN EASILY IMAGINE MR HOLMES HOW CURIOUS I BECAME AS TO WHAT
THE MEANING OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE COULD POSSIBLY BE THEY
WERE ALWAYS VERY CAREFUL I OBSERVED TO TURN MY FACE AWAY FROM THE
WINDOW SO THAT I BECAME CONSUMED WITH THE DESIRE TO SEE WHAT WAS
GOING ON BEHIND MY BACK AT FIRST IT SEEMED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE BUT I
SOON DEVISED A MEANS MY HANDMIRROR HAD BEEN BROKEN SO A HAPPY
THOUGHT SEIZED ME AND I CONCEALED A PIECE OF THE GLASS IN MY
HANDKERCHIEF ON THE NEXT OCCASION IN THE MIDST OF MY LAUGHTER I
PUT MY HANDKERCHIEF UP TO MY EYES AND WAS ABLE WITH A LITTLE
MANAGEMENT TO SEE ALL THAT THERE WAS BEHIND ME I CONFESS THAT I WAS
DISAPPOINTED THERE WAS NOTHING AT LEAST THAT WAS MY FIRST
IMPRESSION AT THE SECOND GLANCE HOWEVER I PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS
A MAN STANDING IN THE SOUTHAMPTON ROAD A SMALL BEARDED MAN IN A GREY
SUIT WHO SEEMED TO BE LOOKING IN MY DIRECTION THE ROAD IS AN
IMPORTANT HIGHWAY AND THERE ARE USUALLY PEOPLE THERE THIS MAN
HOWEVER WAS LEANING AGAINST THE RAILINGS WHICH BORDERED OUR FIELD
AND WAS LOOKING EARNESTLY UP I LOWERED MY HANDKERCHIEF AND GLANCED
AT MRS RUCASTLE TO FIND HER EYES FIXED UPON ME WITH A MOST SEARCHING
GAZE SHE SAID NOTHING BUT I AM CONVINCED THAT SHE HAD DIVINED THAT
I HAD A MIRROR IN MY HAND AND HAD SEEN WHAT WAS BEHIND ME SHE ROSE
AT ONCE
JEPHRO SAID SHE THERE IS AN IMPERTINENT FELLOW UPON THE ROAD
THERE WHO STARES UP AT MISS HUNTER
NO FRIEND OF YOURS MISS HUNTER HE ASKED
NO I KNOW NO ONE IN THESE PARTS
DEAR ME HOW VERY IMPERTINENT KINDLY TURN ROUND AND MOTION TO HIM
TO GO AWAY
SURELY IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE NO NOTICE
NO NO WE SHOULD HAVE HIM LOITERING HERE ALWAYS KINDLY TURN ROUND
AND WAVE HIM AWAY LIKE THAT
I DID AS I WAS TOLD AND AT THE SAME INSTANT MRS RUCASTLE DREW DOWN
THE BLIND THAT WAS A WEEK AGO AND FROM THAT TIME I HAVE NOT SAT
AGAIN IN THE WINDOW NOR HAVE I WORN THE BLUE DRESS NOR SEEN THE MAN
IN THE ROAD
PRAY CONTINUE SAID HOLMES YOUR NARRATIVE PROMISES TO BE A MOST
INTERESTING ONE
YOU WILL FIND IT RATHER DISCONNECTED I FEAR AND THERE MAY PROVE TO
BE LITTLE RELATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT INCIDENTS OF WHICH I SPEAK
ON THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT I WAS AT THE COPPER BEECHES MR RUCASTLE
TOOK ME TO A SMALL OUTHOUSE WHICH STANDS NEAR THE KITCHEN DOOR AS WE
APPROACHED IT I HEARD THE SHARP RATTLING OF A CHAIN AND THE SOUND AS
OF A LARGE ANIMAL MOVING ABOUT
LOOK IN HERE SAID MR RUCASTLE SHOWING ME A SLIT BETWEEN TWO
PLANKS IS HE NOT A BEAUTY
I LOOKED THROUGH AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF TWO GLOWING EYES AND OF A
VAGUE FIGURE HUDDLED UP IN THE DARKNESS
DONT BE FRIGHTENED SAID MY EMPLOYER LAUGHING AT THE START WHICH
I HAD GIVEN ITS ONLY CARLO MY MASTIFF I CALL HIM MINE BUT
REALLY OLD TOLLER MY GROOM IS THE ONLY MAN WHO CAN DO ANYTHING WITH
HIM WE FEED HIM ONCE A DAY AND NOT TOO MUCH THEN SO THAT HE IS
ALWAYS AS KEEN AS MUSTARD TOLLER LETS HIM LOOSE EVERY NIGHT AND GOD
HELP THE TRESPASSER WHOM HE LAYS HIS FANGS UPON FOR GOODNESS SAKE
DONT YOU EVER ON ANY PRETEXT SET YOUR FOOT OVER THE THRESHOLD AT
NIGHT FOR ITS AS MUCH AS YOUR LIFE IS WORTH
THE WARNING WAS NO IDLE ONE FOR TWO NIGHTS LATER I HAPPENED TO LOOK
OUT OF MY BEDROOM WINDOW ABOUT TWO OCLOCK IN THE MORNING IT WAS A
BEAUTIFUL MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND THE LAWN IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE WAS
SILVERED OVER AND ALMOST AS BRIGHT AS DAY I WAS STANDING RAPT IN
THE PEACEFUL BEAUTY OF THE SCENE WHEN I WAS AWARE THAT SOMETHING WAS
MOVING UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE COPPER BEECHES AS IT EMERGED INTO THE
MOONSHINE I SAW WHAT IT WAS IT WAS A GIANT DOG AS LARGE AS A CALF
TAWNY TINTED WITH HANGING JOWL BLACK MUZZLE AND HUGE PROJECTING
BONES IT WALKED SLOWLY ACROSS THE LAWN AND VANISHED INTO THE SHADOW
UPON THE OTHER SIDE THAT DREADFUL SENTINEL SENT A CHILL TO MY HEART
WHICH I DO NOT THINK THAT ANY BURGLAR COULD HAVE DONE
AND NOW I HAVE A VERY STRANGE EXPERIENCE TO TELL YOU I HAD AS YOU
KNOW CUT OFF MY HAIR IN LONDON AND I HAD PLACED IT IN A GREAT COIL
AT THE BOTTOM OF MY TRUNK ONE EVENING AFTER THE CHILD WAS IN BED I
BEGAN TO AMUSE MYSELF BY EXAMINING THE FURNITURE OF MY ROOM AND BY
REARRANGING MY OWN LITTLE THINGS THERE WAS AN OLD CHEST OF DRAWERS
IN THE ROOM THE TWO UPPER ONES EMPTY AND OPEN THE LOWER ONE LOCKED
I HAD FILLED THE FIRST TWO WITH MY LINEN AND AS I HAD STILL MUCH TO
PACK AWAY I WAS NATURALLY ANNOYED AT NOT HAVING THE USE OF THE THIRD
DRAWER IT STRUCK ME THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FASTENED BY A MERE
OVERSIGHT SO I TOOK OUT MY BUNCH OF KEYS AND TRIED TO OPEN IT THE
VERY FIRST KEY FITTED TO PERFECTION AND I DREW THE DRAWER OPEN
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING IN IT BUT I AM SURE THAT YOU WOULD NEVER
GUESS WHAT IT WAS IT WAS MY COIL OF HAIR
I TOOK IT UP AND EXAMINED IT IT WAS OF THE SAME PECULIAR TINT AND
THE SAME THICKNESS BUT THEN THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE THING OBTRUDED
ITSELF UPON ME HOW COULD MY HAIR HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN THE DRAWER
WITH TREMBLING HANDS I UNDID MY TRUNK TURNED OUT THE CONTENTS AND
DREW FROM THE BOTTOM MY OWN HAIR I LAID THE TWO TRESSES TOGETHER
AND I ASSURE YOU THAT THEY WERE IDENTICAL WAS IT NOT EXTRAORDINARY
PUZZLE AS I WOULD I COULD MAKE NOTHING AT ALL OF WHAT IT MEANT I
RETURNED THE STRANGE HAIR TO THE DRAWER AND I SAID NOTHING OF THE
MATTER TO THE RUCASTLES AS I FELT THAT I HAD PUT MYSELF IN THE WRONG
BY OPENING A DRAWER WHICH THEY HAD LOCKED
I AM NATURALLY OBSERVANT AS YOU MAY HAVE REMARKED MR HOLMES AND
I SOON HAD A PRETTY GOOD PLAN OF THE WHOLE HOUSE IN MY HEAD THERE
WAS ONE WING HOWEVER WHICH APPEARED NOT TO BE INHABITED AT ALL A
DOOR WHICH FACED THAT WHICH LED INTO THE QUARTERS OF THE TOLLERS
OPENED INTO THIS SUITE BUT IT WAS INVARIABLY LOCKED ONE DAY
HOWEVER AS I ASCENDED THE STAIR I MET MR RUCASTLE COMING OUT
THROUGH THIS DOOR HIS KEYS IN HIS HAND AND A LOOK ON HIS FACE WHICH
MADE HIM A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON TO THE ROUND JOVIAL MAN TO WHOM I
WAS ACCUSTOMED HIS CHEEKS WERE RED HIS BROW WAS ALL CRINKLED WITH
ANGER AND THE VEINS STOOD OUT AT HIS TEMPLES WITH PASSION HE LOCKED
THE DOOR AND HURRIED PAST ME WITHOUT A WORD OR A LOOK
THIS AROUSED MY CURIOSITY SO WHEN I WENT OUT FOR A WALK IN THE
GROUNDS WITH MY CHARGE I STROLLED ROUND TO THE SIDE FROM WHICH I
COULD SEE THE WINDOWS OF THIS PART OF THE HOUSE THERE WERE FOUR OF
THEM IN A ROW THREE OF WHICH WERE SIMPLY DIRTY WHILE THE FOURTH WAS
SHUTTERED UP THEY WERE EVIDENTLY ALL DESERTED AS I STROLLED UP AND
DOWN GLANCING AT THEM OCCASIONALLY MR RUCASTLE CAME OUT TO ME
LOOKING AS MERRY AND JOVIAL AS EVER
AH SAID HE YOU MUST NOT THINK ME RUDE IF I PASSED YOU WITHOUT A
WORD MY DEAR YOUNG LADY I WAS PREOCCUPIED WITH BUSINESS MATTERS
I ASSURED HIM THAT I WAS NOT OFFENDED BY THE WAY SAID I YOU
SEEM TO HAVE QUITE A SUITE OF SPARE ROOMS UP THERE AND ONE OF THEM
HAS THE SHUTTERS UP
HE LOOKED SURPRISED AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME A LITTLE STARTLED AT MY
REMARK
PHOTOGRAPHY IS ONE OF MY HOBBIES SAID HE I HAVE MADE MY DARK
ROOM UP THERE BUT DEAR ME WHAT AN OBSERVANT YOUNG LADY WE HAVE
COME UPON WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT WHO WOULD HAVE EVER BELIEVED
IT HE SPOKE IN A JESTING TONE BUT THERE WAS NO JEST IN HIS EYES AS
HE LOOKED AT ME I READ SUSPICION THERE AND ANNOYANCE BUT NO JEST
WELL MR HOLMES FROM THE MOMENT THAT I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SUITE OF ROOMS WHICH I WAS NOT TO KNOW I WAS
ALL ON FIRE TO GO OVER THEM IT WAS NOT MERE CURIOSITY THOUGH I HAVE
MY SHARE OF THAT IT WAS MORE A FEELING OF DUTYA FEELING THAT SOME
GOOD MIGHT COME FROM MY PENETRATING TO THIS PLACE THEY TALK OF
WOMANS INSTINCT PERHAPS IT WAS WOMANS INSTINCT WHICH GAVE ME THAT
FEELING AT ANY RATE IT WAS THERE AND I WAS KEENLY ON THE LOOKOUT
FOR ANY CHANCE TO PASS THE FORBIDDEN DOOR
IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY THAT THE CHANCE CAME I MAY TELL YOU THAT
BESIDES MR RUCASTLE BOTH TOLLER AND HIS WIFE FIND SOMETHING TO DO
IN THESE DESERTED ROOMS AND I ONCE SAW HIM CARRYING A LARGE BLACK
LINEN BAG WITH HIM THROUGH THE DOOR RECENTLY HE HAS BEEN DRINKING
HARD AND YESTERDAY EVENING HE WAS VERY DRUNK AND WHEN I CAME
UPSTAIRS THERE WAS THE KEY IN THE DOOR I HAVE NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT
HE HAD LEFT IT THERE MR AND MRS RUCASTLE WERE BOTH DOWNSTAIRS AND
THE CHILD WAS WITH THEM SO THAT I HAD AN ADMIRABLE OPPORTUNITY I
TURNED THE KEY GENTLY IN THE LOCK OPENED THE DOOR AND SLIPPED
THROUGH
THERE WAS A LITTLE PASSAGE IN FRONT OF ME UNPAPERED AND UNCARPETED
WHICH TURNED AT A RIGHT ANGLE AT THE FARTHER END ROUND THIS CORNER
WERE THREE DOORS IN A LINE THE FIRST AND THIRD OF WHICH WERE OPEN
THEY EACH LED INTO AN EMPTY ROOM DUSTY AND CHEERLESS WITH TWO
WINDOWS IN THE ONE AND ONE IN THE OTHER SO THICK WITH DIRT THAT THE
EVENING LIGHT GLIMMERED DIMLY THROUGH THEM THE CENTRE DOOR WAS
CLOSED AND ACROSS THE OUTSIDE OF IT HAD BEEN FASTENED ONE OF THE
BROAD BARS OF AN IRON BED PADLOCKED AT ONE END TO A RING IN THE
WALL AND FASTENED AT THE OTHER WITH STOUT CORD THE DOOR ITSELF WAS
LOCKED AS WELL AND THE KEY WAS NOT THERE THIS BARRICADED DOOR
CORRESPONDED CLEARLY WITH THE SHUTTERED WINDOW OUTSIDE AND YET I
COULD SEE BY THE GLIMMER FROM BENEATH IT THAT THE ROOM WAS NOT IN
DARKNESS EVIDENTLY THERE WAS A SKYLIGHT WHICH LET IN LIGHT FROM
ABOVE AS I STOOD IN THE PASSAGE GAZING AT THE SINISTER DOOR AND
WONDERING WHAT SECRET IT MIGHT VEIL I SUDDENLY HEARD THE SOUND OF
STEPS WITHIN THE ROOM AND SAW A SHADOW PASS BACKWARD AND FORWARD
AGAINST THE LITTLE SLIT OF DIM LIGHT WHICH SHONE OUT FROM UNDER THE
DOOR A MAD UNREASONING TERROR ROSE UP IN ME AT THE SIGHT MR
HOLMES MY OVERSTRUNG NERVES FAILED ME SUDDENLY AND I TURNED AND
RANRAN AS THOUGH SOME DREADFUL HAND WERE BEHIND ME CLUTCHING AT THE
SKIRT OF MY DRESS I RUSHED DOWN THE PASSAGE THROUGH THE DOOR AND
STRAIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF MR RUCASTLE WHO WAS WAITING OUTSIDE
SO SAID HE SMILING IT WAS YOU THEN I THOUGHT THAT IT MUST BE
WHEN I SAW THE DOOR OPEN
OH I AM SO FRIGHTENED I PANTED
MY DEAR YOUNG LADY MY DEAR YOUNG LADYYOU CANNOT THINK HOW
CARESSING AND SOOTHING HIS MANNER WASAND WHAT HAS FRIGHTENED YOU
MY DEAR YOUNG LADY
BUT HIS VOICE WAS JUST A LITTLE TOO COAXING HE OVERDID IT I WAS
KEENLY ON MY GUARD AGAINST HIM
I WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO GO INTO THE EMPTY WING I ANSWERED BUT
IT IS SO LONELY AND EERIE IN THIS DIM LIGHT THAT I WAS FRIGHTENED AND
RAN OUT AGAIN OH IT IS SO DREADFULLY STILL IN THERE
ONLY THAT SAID HE LOOKING AT ME KEENLY
WHY WHAT DID YOU THINK I ASKED
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT I LOCK THIS DOOR
I AM SURE THAT I DO NOT KNOW
IT IS TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT WHO HAVE NO BUSINESS THERE DO YOU SEE
HE WAS STILL SMILING IN THE MOST AMIABLE MANNER
I AM SURE IF I HAD KNOWN
WELL THEN YOU KNOW NOW AND IF YOU EVER PUT YOUR FOOT OVER THAT
THRESHOLD AGAINHERE IN AN INSTANT THE SMILE HARDENED INTO A GRIN
OF RAGE AND HE GLARED DOWN AT ME WITH THE FACE OF A DEMONILL
THROW YOU TO THE MASTIFF
I WAS SO TERRIFIED THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I DID I SUPPOSE THAT I
MUST HAVE RUSHED PAST HIM INTO MY ROOM I REMEMBER NOTHING UNTIL I
FOUND MYSELF LYING ON MY BED TREMBLING ALL OVER THEN I THOUGHT OF
YOU MR HOLMES I COULD NOT LIVE THERE LONGER WITHOUT SOME ADVICE I
WAS FRIGHTENED OF THE HOUSE OF THE MAN OF THE WOMAN OF THE
SERVANTS EVEN OF THE CHILD THEY WERE ALL HORRIBLE TO ME IF I COULD
ONLY BRING YOU DOWN ALL WOULD BE WELL OF COURSE I MIGHT HAVE FLED
FROM THE HOUSE BUT MY CURIOSITY WAS ALMOST AS STRONG AS MY FEARS MY
MIND WAS SOON MADE UP I WOULD SEND YOU A WIRE I PUT ON MY HAT AND
CLOAK WENT DOWN TO THE OFFICE WHICH IS ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE
HOUSE AND THEN RETURNED FEELING VERY MUCH EASIER A HORRIBLE DOUBT
CAME INTO MY MIND AS I APPROACHED THE DOOR LEST THE DOG MIGHT BE
LOOSE BUT I REMEMBERED THAT TOLLER HAD DRUNK HIMSELF INTO A STATE OF
INSENSIBILITY THAT EVENING AND I KNEW THAT HE WAS THE ONLY ONE IN
THE HOUSEHOLD WHO HAD ANY INFLUENCE WITH THE SAVAGE CREATURE OR WHO
WOULD VENTURE TO SET HIM FREE I SLIPPED IN IN SAFETY AND LAY AWAKE
HALF THE NIGHT IN MY JOY AT THE THOUGHT OF SEEING YOU I HAD NO
DIFFICULTY IN GETTING LEAVE TO COME INTO WINCHESTER THIS MORNING BUT
I MUST BE BACK BEFORE THREE OCLOCK FOR MR AND MRS RUCASTLE ARE
GOING ON A VISIT AND WILL BE AWAY ALL THE EVENING SO THAT I MUST
LOOK AFTER THE CHILD NOW I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL MY ADVENTURES MR
HOLMES AND I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD IF YOU COULD TELL ME WHAT IT ALL
MEANS AND ABOVE ALL WHAT I SHOULD DO
HOLMES AND I HAD LISTENED SPELLBOUND TO THIS EXTRAORDINARY STORY MY
FRIEND ROSE NOW AND PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM HIS HANDS IN HIS
POCKETS AND AN EXPRESSION OF THE MOST PROFOUND GRAVITY UPON HIS
FACE
IS TOLLER STILL DRUNK HE ASKED
YES I HEARD HIS WIFE TELL MRS RUCASTLE THAT SHE COULD DO NOTHING
WITH HIM
THAT IS WELL AND THE RUCASTLES GO OUT TONIGHT
YES
IS THERE A CELLAR WITH A GOOD STRONG LOCK
YES THE WINECELLAR
YOU SEEM TO ME TO HAVE ACTED ALL THROUGH THIS MATTER LIKE A VERY
BRAVE AND SENSIBLE GIRL MISS HUNTER DO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD
PERFORM ONE MORE FEAT I SHOULD NOT ASK IT OF YOU IF I DID NOT THINK
YOU A QUITE EXCEPTIONAL WOMAN
I WILL TRY WHAT IS IT
WE SHALL BE AT THE COPPER BEECHES BY SEVEN OCLOCK MY FRIEND AND I
THE RUCASTLES WILL BE GONE BY THAT TIME AND TOLLER WILL WE HOPE BE
INCAPABLE THERE ONLY REMAINS MRS TOLLER WHO MIGHT GIVE THE ALARM
IF YOU COULD SEND HER INTO THE CELLAR ON SOME ERRAND AND THEN TURN
THE KEY UPON HER YOU WOULD FACILITATE MATTERS IMMENSELY
I WILL DO IT
EXCELLENT WE SHALL THEN LOOK THOROUGHLY INTO THE AFFAIR OF COURSE
THERE IS ONLY ONE FEASIBLE EXPLANATION YOU HAVE BEEN BROUGHT THERE
TO PERSONATE SOMEONE AND THE REAL PERSON IS IMPRISONED IN THIS
CHAMBER THAT IS OBVIOUS AS TO WHO THIS PRISONER IS I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT IT IS THE DAUGHTER MISS ALICE RUCASTLE IF I REMEMBER RIGHT
WHO WAS SAID TO HAVE GONE TO AMERICA YOU WERE CHOSEN DOUBTLESS AS
RESEMBLING HER IN HEIGHT FIGURE AND THE COLOUR OF YOUR HAIR HERS
HAD BEEN CUT OFF VERY POSSIBLY IN SOME ILLNESS THROUGH WHICH SHE HAS
PASSED AND SO OF COURSE YOURS HAD TO BE SACRIFICED ALSO BY A
CURIOUS CHANCE YOU CAME UPON HER TRESSES THE MAN IN THE ROAD WAS
UNDOUBTEDLY SOME FRIEND OF HERSPOSSIBLY HER FIANCAND NO DOUBT
AS YOU WORE THE GIRLS DRESS AND WERE SO LIKE HER HE WAS CONVINCED
FROM YOUR LAUGHTER WHENEVER HE SAW YOU AND AFTERWARDS FROM YOUR
GESTURE THAT MISS RUCASTLE WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND THAT SHE NO
LONGER DESIRED HIS ATTENTIONS THE DOG IS LET LOOSE AT NIGHT TO
PREVENT HIM FROM ENDEAVOURING TO COMMUNICATE WITH HER SO MUCH IS
FAIRLY CLEAR THE MOST SERIOUS POINT IN THE CASE IS THE DISPOSITION
OF THE CHILD
WHAT ON EARTH HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT I EJACULATED
MY DEAR WATSON YOU AS A MEDICAL MAN ARE CONTINUALLY GAINING LIGHT
AS TO THE TENDENCIES OF A CHILD BY THE STUDY OF THE PARENTS DONT
YOU SEE THAT THE CONVERSE IS EQUALLY VALID I HAVE FREQUENTLY GAINED
MY FIRST REAL INSIGHT INTO THE CHARACTER OF PARENTS BY STUDYING THEIR
CHILDREN THIS CHILDS DISPOSITION IS ABNORMALLY CRUEL MERELY FOR
CRUELTYS SAKE AND WHETHER HE DERIVES THIS FROM HIS SMILING FATHER
AS I SHOULD SUSPECT OR FROM HIS MOTHER IT BODES EVIL FOR THE POOR
GIRL WHO IS IN THEIR POWER
I AM SURE THAT YOU ARE RIGHT MR HOLMES CRIED OUR CLIENT A
THOUSAND THINGS COME BACK TO ME WHICH MAKE ME CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE
HIT IT OH LET US LOSE NOT AN INSTANT IN BRINGING HELP TO THIS POOR
CREATURE
WE MUST BE CIRCUMSPECT FOR WE ARE DEALING WITH A VERY CUNNING MAN
WE CAN DO NOTHING UNTIL SEVEN OCLOCK AT THAT HOUR WE SHALL BE WITH
YOU AND IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE WE SOLVE THE MYSTERY
WE WERE AS GOOD AS OUR WORD FOR IT WAS JUST SEVEN WHEN WE REACHED
THE COPPER BEECHES HAVING PUT UP OUR TRAP AT A WAYSIDE PUBLICHOUSE
THE GROUP OF TREES WITH THEIR DARK LEAVES SHINING LIKE BURNISHED
METAL IN THE LIGHT OF THE SETTING SUN WERE SUFFICIENT TO MARK THE
HOUSE EVEN HAD MISS HUNTER NOT BEEN STANDING SMILING ON THE
DOORSTEP
HAVE YOU MANAGED IT ASKED HOLMES
A LOUD THUDDING NOISE CAME FROM SOMEWHERE DOWNSTAIRS THAT IS MRS
TOLLER IN THE CELLAR SAID SHE HER HUSBAND LIES SNORING ON THE
KITCHEN RUG HERE ARE HIS KEYS WHICH ARE THE DUPLICATES OF MR
RUCASTLES
YOU HAVE DONE WELL INDEED CRIED HOLMES WITH ENTHUSIASM NOW LEAD
THE WAY AND WE SHALL SOON SEE THE END OF THIS BLACK BUSINESS
WE PASSED UP THE STAIR UNLOCKED THE DOOR FOLLOWED ON DOWN A
PASSAGE AND FOUND OURSELVES IN FRONT OF THE BARRICADE WHICH MISS
HUNTER HAD DESCRIBED HOLMES CUT THE CORD AND REMOVED THE TRANSVERSE
BAR THEN HE TRIED THE VARIOUS KEYS IN THE LOCK BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS
NO SOUND CAME FROM WITHIN AND AT THE SILENCE HOLMES FACE CLOUDED
OVER
I TRUST THAT WE ARE NOT TOO LATE SAID HE I THINK MISS HUNTER
THAT WE HAD BETTER GO IN WITHOUT YOU NOW WATSON PUT YOUR SHOULDER
TO IT AND WE SHALL SEE WHETHER WE CANNOT MAKE OUR WAY IN
IT WAS AN OLD RICKETY DOOR AND GAVE AT ONCE BEFORE OUR UNITED
STRENGTH TOGETHER WE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM IT WAS EMPTY THERE WAS
NO FURNITURE SAVE A LITTLE PALLET BED A SMALL TABLE AND A BASKETFUL
OF LINEN THE SKYLIGHT ABOVE WAS OPEN AND THE PRISONER GONE
THERE HAS BEEN SOME VILLAINY HERE SAID HOLMES THIS BEAUTY HAS
GUESSED MISS HUNTERS INTENTIONS AND HAS CARRIED HIS VICTIM OFF
BUT HOW
THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WE SHALL SOON SEE HOW HE MANAGED IT HE SWUNG
HIMSELF UP ONTO THE ROOF AH YES HE CRIED HERES THE END OF A
LONG LIGHT LADDER AGAINST THE EAVES THAT IS HOW HE DID IT
BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE SAID MISS HUNTER THE LADDER WAS NOT THERE
WHEN THE RUCASTLES WENT AWAY
HE HAS COME BACK AND DONE IT I TELL YOU THAT HE IS A CLEVER AND
DANGEROUS MAN I SHOULD NOT BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED IF THIS WERE HE
WHOSE STEP I HEAR NOW UPON THE STAIR I THINK WATSON THAT IT WOULD
BE AS WELL FOR YOU TO HAVE YOUR PISTOL READY
THE WORDS WERE HARDLY OUT OF HIS MOUTH BEFORE A MAN APPEARED AT THE
DOOR OF THE ROOM A VERY FAT AND BURLY MAN WITH A HEAVY STICK IN HIS
HAND MISS HUNTER SCREAMED AND SHRUNK AGAINST THE WALL AT THE SIGHT
OF HIM BUT SHERLOCK HOLMES SPRANG FORWARD AND CONFRONTED HIM
YOU VILLAIN SAID HE WHERES YOUR DAUGHTER
THE FAT MAN CAST HIS EYES ROUND AND THEN UP AT THE OPEN SKYLIGHT
IT IS FOR ME TO ASK YOU THAT HE SHRIEKED YOU THIEVES SPIES AND
THIEVES I HAVE CAUGHT YOU HAVE I YOU ARE IN MY POWER ILL SERVE
YOU HE TURNED AND CLATTERED DOWN THE STAIRS AS HARD AS HE COULD GO
HES GONE FOR THE DOG CRIED MISS HUNTER
I HAVE MY REVOLVER SAID I
BETTER CLOSE THE FRONT DOOR CRIED HOLMES AND WE ALL RUSHED DOWN
THE STAIRS TOGETHER WE HAD HARDLY REACHED THE HALL WHEN WE HEARD THE
BAYING OF A HOUND AND THEN A SCREAM OF AGONY WITH A HORRIBLE
WORRYING SOUND WHICH IT WAS DREADFUL TO LISTEN TO AN ELDERLY MAN
WITH A RED FACE AND SHAKING LIMBS CAME STAGGERING OUT AT A SIDE DOOR
MY GOD HE CRIED SOMEONE HAS LOOSED THE DOG ITS NOT BEEN FED
FOR TWO DAYS QUICK QUICK OR ITLL BE TOO LATE
HOLMES AND I RUSHED OUT AND ROUND THE ANGLE OF THE HOUSE WITH TOLLER
HURRYING BEHIND US THERE WAS THE HUGE FAMISHED BRUTE ITS BLACK
MUZZLE BURIED IN RUCASTLES THROAT WHILE HE WRITHED AND SCREAMED
UPON THE GROUND RUNNING UP I BLEW ITS BRAINS OUT AND IT FELL OVER
WITH ITS KEEN WHITE TEETH STILL MEETING IN THE GREAT CREASES OF HIS
NECK WITH MUCH LABOUR WE SEPARATED THEM AND CARRIED HIM LIVING BUT
HORRIBLY MANGLED INTO THE HOUSE WE LAID HIM UPON THE DRAWINGROOM
SOFA AND HAVING DISPATCHED THE SOBERED TOLLER TO BEAR THE NEWS TO
HIS WIFE I DID WHAT I COULD TO RELIEVE HIS PAIN WE WERE ALL
ASSEMBLED ROUND HIM WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND A TALL GAUNT WOMAN
ENTERED THE ROOM
MRS TOLLER CRIED MISS HUNTER
YES MISS MR RUCASTLE LET ME OUT WHEN HE CAME BACK BEFORE HE WENT
UP TO YOU AH MISS IT IS A PITY YOU DIDNT LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU
WERE PLANNING FOR I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT YOUR PAINS WERE
WASTED
HA SAID HOLMES LOOKING KEENLY AT HER IT IS CLEAR THAT MRS
TOLLER KNOWS MORE ABOUT THIS MATTER THAN ANYONE ELSE
YES SIR I DO AND I AM READY ENOUGH TO TELL WHAT I KNOW
THEN PRAY SIT DOWN AND LET US HEAR IT FOR THERE ARE SEVERAL
POINTS ON WHICH I MUST CONFESS THAT I AM STILL IN THE DARK
I WILL SOON MAKE IT CLEAR TO YOU SAID SHE AND ID HAVE DONE SO
BEFORE NOW IF I COULD HA GOT OUT FROM THE CELLAR IF THERES
POLICECOURT BUSINESS OVER THIS YOULL REMEMBER THAT I WAS THE ONE
THAT STOOD YOUR FRIEND AND THAT I WAS MISS ALICES FRIEND TOO
SHE WAS NEVER HAPPY AT HOME MISS ALICE WASNT FROM THE TIME THAT
HER FATHER MARRIED AGAIN SHE WAS SLIGHTED LIKE AND HAD NO SAY IN
ANYTHING BUT IT NEVER REALLY BECAME BAD FOR HER UNTIL AFTER SHE MET
MR FOWLER AT A FRIENDS HOUSE AS WELL AS I COULD LEARN MISS ALICE
HAD RIGHTS OF HER OWN BY WILL BUT SHE WAS SO QUIET AND PATIENT SHE
WAS THAT SHE NEVER SAID A WORD ABOUT THEM BUT JUST LEFT EVERYTHING
IN MR RUCASTLES HANDS HE KNEW HE WAS SAFE WITH HER BUT WHEN THERE
WAS A CHANCE OF A HUSBAND COMING FORWARD WHO WOULD ASK FOR ALL THAT
THE LAW WOULD GIVE HIM THEN HER FATHER THOUGHT IT TIME TO PUT A STOP
ON IT HE WANTED HER TO SIGN A PAPER SO THAT WHETHER SHE MARRIED OR
NOT HE COULD USE HER MONEY WHEN SHE WOULDNT DO IT HE KEPT ON
WORRYING HER UNTIL SHE GOT BRAINFEVER AND FOR SIX WEEKS WAS AT
DEATHS DOOR THEN SHE GOT BETTER AT LAST ALL WORN TO A SHADOW AND
WITH HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR CUT OFF BUT THAT DIDNT MAKE NO CHANGE IN
HER YOUNG MAN AND HE STUCK TO HER AS TRUE AS MAN COULD BE
AH SAID HOLMES I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO
TELL US MAKES THE MATTER FAIRLY CLEAR AND THAT I CAN DEDUCE ALL THAT
REMAINS MR RUCASTLE THEN I PRESUME TOOK TO THIS SYSTEM OF
IMPRISONMENT
YES SIR
AND BROUGHT MISS HUNTER DOWN FROM LONDON IN ORDER TO GET RID OF THE
DISAGREEABLE PERSISTENCE OF MR FOWLER
THAT WAS IT SIR
BUT MR FOWLER BEING A PERSEVERING MAN AS A GOOD SEAMAN SHOULD BE
BLOCKADED THE HOUSE AND HAVING MET YOU SUCCEEDED BY CERTAIN
ARGUMENTS METALLIC OR OTHERWISE IN CONVINCING YOU THAT YOUR
INTERESTS WERE THE SAME AS HIS
MR FOWLER WAS A VERY KINDSPOKEN FREEHANDED GENTLEMAN SAID MRS
TOLLER SERENELY
AND IN THIS WAY HE MANAGED THAT YOUR GOOD MAN SHOULD HAVE NO WANT OF
DRINK AND THAT A LADDER SHOULD BE READY AT THE MOMENT WHEN YOUR
MASTER HAD GONE OUT
YOU HAVE IT SIR JUST AS IT HAPPENED
I AM SURE WE OWE YOU AN APOLOGY MRS TOLLER SAID HOLMES FOR YOU
HAVE CERTAINLY CLEARED UP EVERYTHING WHICH PUZZLED US AND HERE COMES
THE COUNTRY SURGEON AND MRS RUCASTLE SO I THINK WATSON THAT WE
HAD BEST ESCORT MISS HUNTER BACK TO WINCHESTER AS IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT OUR LOCUS STANDI NOW IS RATHER A QUESTIONABLE ONE
AND THUS WAS SOLVED THE MYSTERY OF THE SINISTER HOUSE WITH THE COPPER
BEECHES IN FRONT OF THE DOOR MR RUCASTLE SURVIVED BUT WAS ALWAYS A
BROKEN MAN KEPT ALIVE SOLELY THROUGH THE CARE OF HIS DEVOTED WIFE
THEY STILL LIVE WITH THEIR OLD SERVANTS WHO PROBABLY KNOW SO MUCH OF
RUCASTLES PAST LIFE THAT HE FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO PART FROM THEM
MR FOWLER AND MISS RUCASTLE WERE MARRIED BY SPECIAL LICENSE IN
SOUTHAMPTON THE DAY AFTER THEIR FLIGHT AND HE IS NOW THE HOLDER OF A
GOVERNMENT APPOINTMENT IN THE ISLAND OF MAURITIUS AS TO MISS VIOLET
HUNTER MY FRIEND HOLMES RATHER TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT MANIFESTED NO
FURTHER INTEREST IN HER WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF
ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS AND SHE IS NOW THE HEAD OF A PRIVATE SCHOOL AT
WALSALL WHERE I BELIEVE THAT SHE HAS MET WITH CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS
THE MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
SILVER BLAZE
I AM AFRAID WATSON THAT I SHALL HAVE TO GO SAID HOLMES AS WE
SAT DOWN TOGETHER TO OUR BREAKFAST ONE MORNING
GO WHERE TO
TO DARTMOOR TO KINGS PYLAND
I WAS NOT SURPRISED INDEED MY ONLY WONDER WAS THAT HE HAD NOT
ALREADY BEEN MIXED UP IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY CASE WHICH WAS THE ONE
TOPIC OF CONVERSATION THROUGH THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF ENGLAND FOR
A WHOLE DAY MY COMPANION HAD RAMBLED ABOUT THE ROOM WITH HIS CHIN
UPON HIS CHEST AND HIS BROWS KNITTED CHARGING AND RECHARGING HIS
PIPE WITH THE STRONGEST BLACK TOBACCO AND ABSOLUTELY DEAF TO ANY OF
MY QUESTIONS OR REMARKS FRESH EDITIONS OF EVERY PAPER HAD BEEN SENT
UP BY OUR NEWS AGENT ONLY TO BE GLANCED OVER AND TOSSED DOWN INTO A
CORNER YET SILENT AS HE WAS I KNEW PERFECTLY WELL WHAT IT WAS OVER
WHICH HE WAS BROODING THERE WAS BUT ONE PROBLEM BEFORE THE PUBLIC
WHICH COULD CHALLENGE HIS POWERS OF ANALYSIS AND THAT WAS THE
SINGULAR DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FAVORITE FOR THE WESSEX CUP AND THE
TRAGIC MURDER OF ITS TRAINER WHEN THEREFORE HE SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED
HIS INTENTION OF SETTING OUT FOR THE SCENE OF THE DRAMA IT WAS ONLY
WHAT I HAD BOTH EXPECTED AND HOPED FOR
I SHOULD BE MOST HAPPY TO GO DOWN WITH YOU IF I SHOULD NOT BE IN THE
WAY SAID I
MY DEAR WATSON YOU WOULD CONFER A GREAT FAVOUR UPON ME BY COMING
AND I THINK THAT YOUR TIME WILL NOT BE MISSPENT FOR THERE ARE POINTS
ABOUT THE CASE WHICH PROMISE TO MAKE IT AN ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE ONE WE
HAVE I THINK JUST TIME TO CATCH OUR TRAIN AT PADDINGTON AND I WILL
GO FURTHER INTO THE MATTER UPON OUR JOURNEY YOU WOULD OBLIGE ME BY
BRINGING WITH YOU YOUR VERY EXCELLENT FIELDGLASS
AND SO IT HAPPENED THAT AN HOUR OR SO LATER I FOUND MYSELF IN THE
CORNER OF A FIRSTCLASS CARRIAGE FLYING ALONG EN ROUTE FOR EXETER
WHILE SHERLOCK HOLMES WITH HIS SHARP EAGER FACE FRAMED IN HIS
EARFLAPPED TRAVELLINGCAP DIPPED RAPIDLY INTO THE BUNDLE OF FRESH
PAPERS WHICH HE HAD PROCURED AT PADDINGTON WE HAD LEFT READING FAR
BEHIND US BEFORE HE THRUST THE LAST ONE OF THEM UNDER THE SEAT AND
OFFERED ME HIS CIGARCASE
WE ARE GOING WELL SAID HE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND GLANCING AT
HIS WATCH OUR RATE AT PRESENT IS FIFTYTHREE AND A HALF MILES AN
HOUR
I HAVE NOT OBSERVED THE QUARTERMILE POSTS SAID I
NOR HAVE I BUT THE TELEGRAPH POSTS UPON THIS LINE ARE SIXTY YARDS
APART AND THE CALCULATION IS A SIMPLE ONE I PRESUME THAT YOU HAVE
LOOKED INTO THIS MATTER OF THE MURDER OF JOHN STRAKER AND THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF SILVER BLAZE
I HAVE SEEN WHAT THE TELEGRAPH AND THE CHRONICLE HAVE TO SAY
IT IS ONE OF THOSE CASES WHERE THE ART OF THE REASONER SHOULD BE
USED RATHER FOR THE SIFTING OF DETAILS THAN FOR THE ACQUIRING OF
FRESH EVIDENCE THE TRAGEDY HAS BEEN SO UNCOMMON SO COMPLETE AND OF
SUCH PERSONAL IMPORTANCE TO SO MANY PEOPLE THAT WE ARE SUFFERING
FROM A PLETHORA OF SURMISE CONJECTURE AND HYPOTHESIS THE
DIFFICULTY IS TO DETACH THE FRAMEWORK OF FACTOF ABSOLUTE UNDENIABLE
FACTFROM THE EMBELLISHMENTS OF THEORISTS AND REPORTERS THEN
HAVING ESTABLISHED OURSELVES UPON THIS SOUND BASIS IT IS OUR DUTY TO
SEE WHAT INFERENCES MAY BE DRAWN AND WHAT ARE THE SPECIAL POINTS UPON
WHICH THE WHOLE MYSTERY TURNS ON TUESDAY EVENING I RECEIVED
TELEGRAMS FROM BOTH COLONEL ROSS THE OWNER OF THE HORSE AND FROM
INSPECTOR GREGORY WHO IS LOOKING AFTER THE CASE INVITING MY
COOPERATION
TUESDAY EVENING I EXCLAIMED AND THIS IS THURSDAY MORNING WHY
DIDNT YOU GO DOWN YESTERDAY
BECAUSE I MADE A BLUNDER MY DEAR WATSONWHICH IS I AM AFRAID A
MORE COMMON OCCURRENCE THAN ANY ONE WOULD THINK WHO ONLY KNEW ME
THROUGH YOUR MEMOIRS THE FACT IS THAT I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT
POSSIBLE THAT THE MOST REMARKABLE HORSE IN ENGLAND COULD LONG REMAIN
CONCEALED ESPECIALLY IN SO SPARSELY INHABITED A PLACE AS THE NORTH
OF DARTMOOR FROM HOUR TO HOUR YESTERDAY I EXPECTED TO HEAR THAT HE
HAD BEEN FOUND AND THAT HIS ABDUCTOR WAS THE MURDERER OF JOHN
STRAKER WHEN HOWEVER ANOTHER MORNING HAD COME AND I FOUND THAT
BEYOND THE ARREST OF YOUNG FITZROY SIMPSON NOTHING HAD BEEN DONE I
FELT THAT IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO TAKE ACTION YET IN SOME WAYS I FEEL
THAT YESTERDAY HAS NOT BEEN WASTED
YOU HAVE FORMED A THEORY THEN
AT LEAST I HAVE GOT A GRIP OF THE ESSENTIAL FACTS OF THE CASE I
SHALL ENUMERATE THEM TO YOU FOR NOTHING CLEARS UP A CASE SO MUCH AS
STATING IT TO ANOTHER PERSON AND I CAN HARDLY EXPECT YOUR
COOPERATION IF I DO NOT SHOW YOU THE POSITION FROM WHICH WE START
I LAY BACK AGAINST THE CUSHIONS PUFFING AT MY CIGAR WHILE HOLMES
LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS LONG THIN FOREFINGER CHECKING OFF THE
POINTS UPON THE PALM OF HIS LEFT HAND GAVE ME A SKETCH OF THE EVENTS
WHICH HAD LED TO OUR JOURNEY
SILVER BLAZE SAID HE IS FROM THE SOMOMY STOCK AND HOLDS AS
BRILLIANT A RECORD AS HIS FAMOUS ANCESTOR HE IS NOW IN HIS FIFTH
YEAR AND HAS BROUGHT IN TURN EACH OF THE PRIZES OF THE TURF TO
COLONEL ROSS HIS FORTUNATE OWNER UP TO THE TIME OF THE CATASTROPHE
HE WAS THE FIRST FAVORITE FOR THE WESSEX CUP THE BETTING BEING THREE
TO ONE ON HIM HE HAS ALWAYS HOWEVER BEEN A PRIME FAVORITE WITH THE
RACING PUBLIC AND HAS NEVER YET DISAPPOINTED THEM SO THAT EVEN AT
THOSE ODDS ENORMOUS SUMS OF MONEY HAVE BEEN LAID UPON HIM IT IS
OBVIOUS THEREFORE THAT THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAD THE STRONGEST
INTEREST IN PREVENTING SILVER BLAZE FROM BEING THERE AT THE FALL OF
THE FLAG NEXT TUESDAY
THE FACT WAS OF COURSE APPRECIATED AT KINGS PYLAND WHERE THE
COLONELS TRAININGSTABLE IS SITUATED EVERY PRECAUTION WAS TAKEN TO
GUARD THE FAVORITE THE TRAINER JOHN STRAKER IS A RETIRED JOCKEY
WHO RODE IN COLONEL ROSSS COLORS BEFORE HE BECAME TOO HEAVY FOR THE
WEIGHINGCHAIR HE HAS SERVED THE COLONEL FOR FIVE YEARS AS JOCKEY
AND FOR SEVEN AS TRAINER AND HAS ALWAYS SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE A
ZEALOUS AND HONEST SERVANT UNDER HIM WERE THREE LADS FOR THE
ESTABLISHMENT WAS A SMALL ONE CONTAINING ONLY FOUR HORSES IN ALL
ONE OF THESE LADS SAT UP EACH NIGHT IN THE STABLE WHILE THE OTHERS
SLEPT IN THE LOFT ALL THREE BORE EXCELLENT CHARACTERS JOHN STRAKER
WHO IS A MARRIED MAN LIVED IN A SMALL VILLA ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS
FROM THE STABLES HE HAS NO CHILDREN KEEPS ONE MAIDSERVANT AND IS
COMFORTABLY OFF THE COUNTRY ROUND IS VERY LONELY BUT ABOUT HALF A
MILE TO THE NORTH THERE IS A SMALL CLUSTER OF VILLAS WHICH HAVE BEEN
BUILT BY A TAVISTOCK CONTRACTOR FOR THE USE OF INVALIDS AND OTHERS
WHO MAY WISH TO ENJOY THE PURE DARTMOOR AIR TAVISTOCK ITSELF LIES
TWO MILES TO THE WEST WHILE ACROSS THE MOOR ALSO ABOUT TWO MILES
DISTANT IS THE LARGER TRAINING ESTABLISHMENT OF MAPLETON WHICH
BELONGS TO LORD BACKWATER AND IS MANAGED BY SILAS BROWN IN EVERY
OTHER DIRECTION THE MOOR IS A COMPLETE WILDERNESS INHABITED ONLY BY
A FEW ROAMING GYPSIES SUCH WAS THE GENERAL SITUATION LAST MONDAY
NIGHT WHEN THE CATASTROPHE OCCURRED
ON THAT EVENING THE HORSES HAD BEEN EXERCISED AND WATERED AS USUAL
AND THE STABLES WERE LOCKED UP AT NINE OCLOCK TWO OF THE LADS
WALKED UP TO THE TRAINERS HOUSE WHERE THEY HAD SUPPER IN THE
KITCHEN WHILE THE THIRD NED HUNTER REMAINED ON GUARD AT A FEW
MINUTES AFTER NINE THE MAID EDITH BAXTER CARRIED DOWN TO THE
STABLES HIS SUPPER WHICH CONSISTED OF A DISH OF CURRIED MUTTON SHE
TOOK NO LIQUID AS THERE WAS A WATERTAP IN THE STABLES AND IT WAS
THE RULE THAT THE LAD ON DUTY SHOULD DRINK NOTHING ELSE THE MAID
CARRIED A LANTERN WITH HER AS IT WAS VERY DARK AND THE PATH RAN
ACROSS THE OPEN MOOR
EDITH BAXTER WAS WITHIN THIRTY YARDS OF THE STABLES WHEN A MAN
APPEARED OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND CALLED TO HER TO STOP AS HE STEPPED
INTO THE CIRCLE OF YELLOW LIGHT THROWN BY THE LANTERN SHE SAW THAT HE
WAS A PERSON OF GENTLEMANLY BEARING DRESSED IN A GRAY SUIT OF
TWEEDS WITH A CLOTH CAP HE WORE GAITERS AND CARRIED A HEAVY STICK
WITH A KNOB TO IT SHE WAS MOST IMPRESSED HOWEVER BY THE EXTREME
PALLOR OF HIS FACE AND BY THE NERVOUSNESS OF HIS MANNER HIS AGE SHE
THOUGHT WOULD BE RATHER OVER THIRTY THAN UNDER IT
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I AM HE ASKED I HAD ALMOST MADE UP MY
MIND TO SLEEP ON THE MOOR WHEN I SAW THE LIGHT OF YOUR LANTERN
YOU ARE CLOSE TO THE KINGS PYLAND TRAININGSTABLES SAID SHE
OH INDEED WHAT A STROKE OF LUCK HE CRIED I UNDERSTAND THAT A
STABLEBOY SLEEPS THERE ALONE EVERY NIGHT PERHAPS THAT IS HIS SUPPER
WHICH YOU ARE CARRYING TO HIM NOW I AM SURE THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE
TOO PROUD TO EARN THE PRICE OF A NEW DRESS WOULD YOU HE TOOK A
PIECE OF WHITE PAPER FOLDED UP OUT OF HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET SEE THAT
THE BOY HAS THIS TONIGHT AND YOU SHALL HAVE THE PRETTIEST FROCK
THAT MONEY CAN BUY
SHE WAS FRIGHTENED BY THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS MANNER AND RAN PAST
HIM TO THE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO HAND THE MEALS
IT WAS ALREADY OPENED AND HUNTER WAS SEATED AT THE SMALL TABLE
INSIDE SHE HAD BEGUN TO TELL HIM OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN THE
STRANGER CAME UP AGAIN
GOODEVENING SAID HE LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW I WANTED TO
HAVE A WORD WITH YOU THE GIRL HAS SWORN THAT AS HE SPOKE SHE
NOTICED THE CORNER OF THE LITTLE PAPER PACKET PROTRUDING FROM HIS
CLOSED HAND
WHAT BUSINESS HAVE YOU HERE ASKED THE LAD
ITS BUSINESS THAT MAY PUT SOMETHING INTO YOUR POCKET SAID THE
OTHER YOUVE TWO HORSES IN FOR THE WESSEX CUPSILVER BLAZE AND
BAYARD LET ME HAVE THE STRAIGHT TIP AND YOU WONT BE A LOSER IS IT
A FACT THAT AT THE WEIGHTS BAYARD COULD GIVE THE OTHER A HUNDRED
YARDS IN FIVE FURLONGS AND THAT THE STABLE HAVE PUT THEIR MONEY ON
HIM
SO YOURE ONE OF THOSE DAMNED TOUTS CRIED THE LAD ILL SHOW
YOU HOW WE SERVE THEM IN KINGS PYLAND HE SPRANG UP AND RUSHED
ACROSS THE STABLE TO UNLOOSE THE DOG THE GIRL FLED AWAY TO THE
HOUSE BUT AS SHE RAN SHE LOOKED BACK AND SAW THAT THE STRANGER WAS
LEANING THROUGH THE WINDOW A MINUTE LATER HOWEVER WHEN HUNTER
RUSHED OUT WITH THE HOUND HE WAS GONE AND THOUGH HE RAN ALL ROUND
THE BUILDINGS HE FAILED TO FIND ANY TRACE OF HIM
ONE MOMENT I ASKED DID THE STABLEBOY WHEN HE RAN OUT WITH THE
DOG LEAVE THE DOOR UNLOCKED BEHIND HIM
EXCELLENT WATSON EXCELLENT MURMURED MY COMPANION THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE POINT STRUCK ME SO FORCIBLY THAT I SENT A SPECIAL
WIRE TO DARTMOOR YESTERDAY TO CLEAR THE MATTER UP THE BOY LOCKED THE
DOOR BEFORE HE LEFT IT THE WINDOW I MAY ADD WAS NOT LARGE ENOUGH
FOR A MAN TO GET THROUGH
HUNTER WAITED UNTIL HIS FELLOWGROOMS HAD RETURNED WHEN HE SENT A
MESSAGE TO THE TRAINER AND TOLD HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED STRAKER WAS
EXCITED AT HEARING THE ACCOUNT ALTHOUGH HE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE
QUITE REALIZED ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE IT LEFT HIM HOWEVER VAGUELY
UNEASY AND MRS STRAKER WAKING AT ONE IN THE MORNING FOUND THAT HE
WAS DRESSING IN REPLY TO HER INQUIRIES HE SAID THAT HE COULD NOT
SLEEP ON ACCOUNT OF HIS ANXIETY ABOUT THE HORSES AND THAT HE
INTENDED TO WALK DOWN TO THE STABLES TO SEE THAT ALL WAS WELL SHE
BEGGED HIM TO REMAIN AT HOME AS SHE COULD HEAR THE RAIN PATTERING
AGAINST THE WINDOW BUT IN SPITE OF HER ENTREATIES HE PULLED ON HIS
LARGE MACKINTOSH AND LEFT THE HOUSE
MRS STRAKER AWOKE AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING TO FIND THAT HER HUSBAND
HAD NOT YET RETURNED SHE DRESSED HERSELF HASTILY CALLED THE MAID
AND SET OFF FOR THE STABLES THE DOOR WAS OPEN INSIDE HUDDLED
TOGETHER UPON A CHAIR HUNTER WAS SUNK IN A STATE OF ABSOLUTE STUPOR
THE FAVORITES STALL WAS EMPTY AND THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF HIS
TRAINER
THE TWO LADS WHO SLEPT IN THE CHAFFCUTTING LOFT ABOVE THE
HARNESSROOM WERE QUICKLY AROUSED THEY HAD HEARD NOTHING DURING THE
NIGHT FOR THEY ARE BOTH SOUND SLEEPERS HUNTER WAS OBVIOUSLY UNDER
THE INFLUENCE OF SOME POWERFUL DRUG AND AS NO SENSE COULD BE GOT OUT
OF HIM HE WAS LEFT TO SLEEP IT OFF WHILE THE TWO LADS AND THE TWO
WOMEN RAN OUT IN SEARCH OF THE ABSENTEES THEY STILL HAD HOPES THAT
THE TRAINER HAD FOR SOME REASON TAKEN OUT THE HORSE FOR EARLY
EXERCISE BUT ON ASCENDING THE KNOLL NEAR THE HOUSE FROM WHICH ALL
THE NEIGHBORING MOORS WERE VISIBLE THEY NOT ONLY COULD SEE NO SIGNS
OF THE MISSING FAVORITE BUT THEY PERCEIVED SOMETHING WHICH WARNED
THEM THAT THEY WERE IN THE PRESENCE OF A TRAGEDY
ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE STABLES JOHN STRAKERS OVERCOAT
WAS FLAPPING FROM A FURZEBUSH IMMEDIATELY BEYOND THERE WAS A
BOWLSHAPED DEPRESSION IN THE MOOR AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS WAS
FOUND THE DEAD BODY OF THE UNFORTUNATE TRAINER HIS HEAD HAD BEEN
SHATTERED BY A SAVAGE BLOW FROM SOME HEAVY WEAPON AND HE WAS WOUNDED
ON THE THIGH WHERE THERE WAS A LONG CLEAN CUT INFLICTED EVIDENTLY
BY SOME VERY SHARP INSTRUMENT IT WAS CLEAR HOWEVER THAT STRAKER
HAD DEFENDED HIMSELF VIGOROUSLY AGAINST HIS ASSAILANTS FOR IN HIS
RIGHT HAND HE HELD A SMALL KNIFE WHICH WAS CLOTTED WITH BLOOD UP TO
THE HANDLE WHILE IN HIS LEFT HE CLASPED A RED AND BLACK SILK CRAVAT
WHICH WAS RECOGNIZED BY THE MAID AS HAVING BEEN WORN ON THE PRECEDING
EVENING BY THE STRANGER WHO HAD VISITED THE STABLES HUNTER ON
RECOVERING FROM HIS STUPOR WAS ALSO QUITE POSITIVE AS TO THE
OWNERSHIP OF THE CRAVAT HE WAS EQUALLY CERTAIN THAT THE SAME
STRANGER HAD WHILE STANDING AT THE WINDOW DRUGGED HIS CURRIED
MUTTON AND SO DEPRIVED THE STABLES OF THEIR WATCHMAN AS TO THE
MISSING HORSE THERE WERE ABUNDANT PROOFS IN THE MUD WHICH LAY AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE FATAL HOLLOW THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE AT THE TIME OF THE
STRUGGLE BUT FROM THAT MORNING HE HAS DISAPPEARED AND ALTHOUGH A
LARGE REWARD HAS BEEN OFFERED AND ALL THE GYPSIES OF DARTMOOR ARE ON
THE ALERT NO NEWS HAS COME OF HIM FINALLY AN ANALYSIS HAS SHOWN
THAT THE REMAINS OF HIS SUPPER LEFT BY THE STABLELAD CONTAIN AN
APPRECIABLE QUANTITY OF POWDERED OPIUM WHILE THE PEOPLE AT THE HOUSE
PARTOOK OF THE SAME DISH ON THE SAME NIGHT WITHOUT ANY ILL EFFECT
THOSE ARE THE MAIN FACTS OF THE CASE STRIPPED OF ALL SURMISE AND
STATED AS BALDLY AS POSSIBLE I SHALL NOW RECAPITULATE WHAT THE
POLICE HAVE DONE IN THE MATTER
INSPECTOR GREGORY TO WHOM THE CASE HAS BEEN COMMITTED IS AN
EXTREMELY COMPETENT OFFICER WERE HE BUT GIFTED WITH IMAGINATION HE
MIGHT RISE TO GREAT HEIGHTS IN HIS PROFESSION ON HIS ARRIVAL HE
PROMPTLY FOUND AND ARRESTED THE MAN UPON WHOM SUSPICION NATURALLY
RESTED THERE WAS LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING HIM FOR HE INHABITED
ONE OF THOSE VILLAS WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED HIS NAME IT APPEARS WAS
FITZROY SIMPSON HE WAS A MAN OF EXCELLENT BIRTH AND EDUCATION WHO
HAD SQUANDERED A FORTUNE UPON THE TURF AND WHO LIVED NOW BY DOING A
LITTLE QUIET AND GENTEEL BOOKMAKING IN THE SPORTING CLUBS OF LONDON
AN EXAMINATION OF HIS BETTINGBOOK SHOWS THAT BETS TO THE AMOUNT OF
FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS HAD BEEN REGISTERED BY HIM AGAINST THE FAVORITE
ON BEING ARRESTED HE VOLUNTEERED THE STATEMENT THAT HE HAD COME DOWN
TO DARTMOOR IN THE HOPE OF GETTING SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE KINGS
PYLAND HORSES AND ALSO ABOUT DESBOROUGH THE SECOND FAVORITE WHICH
WAS IN CHARGE OF SILAS BROWN AT THE MAPLETON STABLES HE DID NOT
ATTEMPT TO DENY THAT HE HAD ACTED AS DESCRIBED UPON THE EVENING
BEFORE BUT DECLARED THAT HE HAD NO SINISTER DESIGNS AND HAD SIMPLY
WISHED TO OBTAIN FIRSTHAND INFORMATION WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HIS
CRAVAT HE TURNED VERY PALE AND WAS UTTERLY UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR
ITS PRESENCE IN THE HAND OF THE MURDERED MAN HIS WET CLOTHING SHOWED
THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT IN THE STORM OF THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HIS STICK
WHICH WAS A PENANGLAWYER WEIGHTED WITH LEAD WAS JUST SUCH A WEAPON
AS MIGHT BY REPEATED BLOWS HAVE INFLICTED THE TERRIBLE INJURIES TO
WHICH THE TRAINER HAD SUCCUMBED ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WAS NO
WOUND UPON HIS PERSON WHILE THE STATE OF STRAKERS KNIFE WOULD SHOW
THAT ONE AT LEAST OF HIS ASSAILANTS MUST BEAR HIS MARK UPON HIM
THERE YOU HAVE IT ALL IN A NUTSHELL WATSON AND IF YOU CAN GIVE ME
ANY LIGHT I SHALL BE INFINITELY OBLIGED TO YOU
I HAD LISTENED WITH THE GREATEST INTEREST TO THE STATEMENT WHICH
HOLMES WITH CHARACTERISTIC CLEARNESS HAD LAID BEFORE ME THOUGH
MOST OF THE FACTS WERE FAMILIAR TO ME I HAD NOT SUFFICIENTLY
APPRECIATED THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE NOR THEIR CONNECTION TO EACH
OTHER
IS IN NOT POSSIBLE I SUGGESTED THAT THE INCISED WOUND UPON
STRAKER MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY HIS OWN KNIFE IN THE CONVULSIVE
STRUGGLES WHICH FOLLOW ANY BRAIN INJURY
IT IS MORE THAN POSSIBLE IT IS PROBABLE SAID HOLMES IN THAT
CASE ONE OF THE MAIN POINTS IN FAVOR OF THE ACCUSED DISAPPEARS
AND YET SAID I EVEN NOW I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE THEORY OF
THE POLICE CAN BE
I AM AFRAID THAT WHATEVER THEORY WE STATE HAS VERY GRAVE OBJECTIONS
TO IT RETURNED MY COMPANION THE POLICE IMAGINE I TAKE IT THAT
THIS FITZROY SIMPSON HAVING DRUGGED THE LAD AND HAVING IN SOME WAY
OBTAINED A DUPLICATE KEY OPENED THE STABLE DOOR AND TOOK OUT THE
HORSE WITH THE INTENTION APPARENTLY OF KIDNAPPING HIM ALTOGETHER
HIS BRIDLE IS MISSING SO THAT SIMPSON MUST HAVE PUT THIS ON THEN
HAVING LEFT THE DOOR OPEN BEHIND HIM HE WAS LEADING THE HORSE AWAY
OVER THE MOOR WHEN HE WAS EITHER MET OR OVERTAKEN BY THE TRAINER A
ROW NATURALLY ENSUED SIMPSON BEAT OUT THE TRAINERS BRAINS WITH HIS
HEAVY STICK WITHOUT RECEIVING ANY INJURY FROM THE SMALL KNIFE WHICH
STRAKER USED IN SELFDEFENCE AND THEN THE THIEF EITHER LED THE HORSE
ON TO SOME SECRET HIDINGPLACE OR ELSE IT MAY HAVE BOLTED DURING THE
STRUGGLE AND BE NOW WANDERING OUT ON THE MOORS THAT IS THE CASE AS
IT APPEARS TO THE POLICE AND IMPROBABLE AS IT IS ALL OTHER
EXPLANATIONS ARE MORE IMPROBABLE STILL HOWEVER I SHALL VERY QUICKLY
TEST THE MATTER WHEN I AM ONCE UPON THE SPOT AND UNTIL THEN I CANNOT
REALLY SEE HOW WE CAN GET MUCH FURTHER THAN OUR PRESENT POSITION
IT WAS EVENING BEFORE WE REACHED THE LITTLE TOWN OF TAVISTOCK WHICH
LIES LIKE THE BOSS OF A SHIELD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HUGE CIRCLE OF
DARTMOOR TWO GENTLEMEN WERE AWAITING US IN THE STATIONTHE ONE A
TALL FAIR MAN WITH LIONLIKE HAIR AND BEARD AND CURIOUSLY
PENETRATING LIGHT BLUE EYES THE OTHER A SMALL ALERT PERSON VERY
NEAT AND DAPPER IN A FROCKCOAT AND GAITERS WITH TRIM LITTLE
SIDEWHISKERS AND AN EYEGLASS THE LATTER WAS COLONEL ROSS THE
WELLKNOWN SPORTSMAN THE OTHER INSPECTOR GREGORY A MAN WHO WAS
RAPIDLY MAKING HIS NAME IN THE ENGLISH DETECTIVE SERVICE
I AM DELIGHTED THAT YOU HAVE COME DOWN MR HOLMES SAID THE
COLONEL THE INSPECTOR HERE HAS DONE ALL THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE
SUGGESTED BUT I WISH TO LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED IN TRYING TO AVENGE
POOR STRAKER AND IN RECOVERING MY HORSE
HAVE THERE BEEN ANY FRESH DEVELOPMENTS ASKED HOLMES
I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT WE HAVE MADE VERY LITTLE PROGRESS SAID THE
INSPECTOR WE HAVE AN OPEN CARRIAGE OUTSIDE AND AS YOU WOULD NO
DOUBT LIKE TO SEE THE PLACE BEFORE THE LIGHT FAILS WE MIGHT TALK IT
OVER AS WE DRIVE
A MINUTE LATER WE WERE ALL SEATED IN A COMFORTABLE LANDAU AND WERE
RATTLING THROUGH THE QUAINT OLD DEVONSHIRE CITY INSPECTOR GREGORY
WAS FULL OF HIS CASE AND POURED OUT A STREAM OF REMARKS WHILE
HOLMES THREW IN AN OCCASIONAL QUESTION OR INTERJECTION COLONEL ROSS
LEANED BACK WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED AND HIS HAT TILTED OVER HIS EYES
WHILE I LISTENED WITH INTEREST TO THE DIALOGUE OF THE TWO DETECTIVES
GREGORY WAS FORMULATING HIS THEORY WHICH WAS ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT
HOLMES HAD FORETOLD IN THE TRAIN
THE NET IS DRAWN PRETTY CLOSE ROUND FITZROY SIMPSON HE REMARKED
AND I BELIEVE MYSELF THAT HE IS OUR MAN AT THE SAME TIME I
RECOGNIZE THAT THE EVIDENCE IS PURELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND THAT SOME
NEW DEVELOPMENT MAY UPSET IT
HOW ABOUT STRAKERS KNIFE
WE HAVE QUITE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE WOUNDED HIMSELF IN HIS
FALL
MY FRIEND DR WATSON MADE THAT SUGGESTION TO ME AS WE CAME DOWN IF
SO IT WOULD TELL AGAINST THIS MAN SIMPSON
UNDOUBTEDLY HE HAS NEITHER A KNIFE NOR ANY SIGN OF A WOUND THE
EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM IS CERTAINLY VERY STRONG HE HAD A GREAT
INTEREST IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FAVORITE HE LIES UNDER
SUSPICION OF HAVING POISONED THE STABLEBOY HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY OUT
IN THE STORM HE WAS ARMED WITH A HEAVY STICK AND HIS CRAVAT WAS
FOUND IN THE DEAD MANS HAND I REALLY THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH TO GO
BEFORE A JURY
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD A CLEVER COUNSEL WOULD TEAR IT ALL TO RAGS
SAID HE WHY SHOULD HE TAKE THE HORSE OUT OF THE STABLE IF HE
WISHED TO INJURE IT WHY COULD HE NOT DO IT THERE HAS A DUPLICATE KEY
BEEN FOUND IN HIS POSSESSION WHAT CHEMIST SOLD HIM THE POWDERED
OPIUM ABOVE ALL WHERE COULD HE A STRANGER TO THE DISTRICT HIDE A
HORSE AND SUCH A HORSE AS THIS WHAT IS HIS OWN EXPLANATION AS TO
THE PAPER WHICH HE WISHED THE MAID TO GIVE TO THE STABLEBOY
HE SAYS THAT IT WAS A TENPOUND NOTE ONE WAS FOUND IN HIS PURSE
BUT YOUR OTHER DIFFICULTIES ARE NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS THEY SEEM HE IS
NOT A STRANGER TO THE DISTRICT HE HAS TWICE LODGED AT TAVISTOCK IN
THE SUMMER THE OPIUM WAS PROBABLY BROUGHT FROM LONDON THE KEY
HAVING SERVED ITS PURPOSE WOULD BE HURLED AWAY THE HORSE MAY BE AT
THE BOTTOM OF ONE OF THE PITS OR OLD MINES UPON THE MOOR
WHAT DOES HE SAY ABOUT THE CRAVAT
HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS HIS AND DECLARES THAT HE HAD LOST IT
BUT A NEW ELEMENT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE CASE WHICH MAY ACCOUNT
FOR HIS LEADING THE HORSE FROM THE STABLE
HOLMES PRICKED UP HIS EARS
WE HAVE FOUND TRACES WHICH SHOW THAT A PARTY OF GYPSIES ENCAMPED ON
MONDAY NIGHT WITHIN A MILE OF THE SPOT WHERE THE MURDER TOOK PLACE
ON TUESDAY THEY WERE GONE NOW PRESUMING THAT THERE WAS SOME
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN SIMPSON AND THESE GYPSIES MIGHT HE NOT HAVE
BEEN LEADING THE HORSE TO THEM WHEN HE WAS OVERTAKEN AND MAY THEY
NOT HAVE HIM NOW
IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE
THE MOOR IS BEING SCOURED FOR THESE GYPSIES I HAVE ALSO EXAMINED
EVERY STABLE AND OUTHOUSE IN TAVISTOCK AND FOR A RADIUS OF TEN
MILES
THERE IS ANOTHER TRAININGSTABLE QUITE CLOSE I UNDERSTAND
YES AND THAT IS A FACTOR WHICH WE MUST CERTAINLY NOT NEGLECT AS
DESBOROUGH THEIR HORSE WAS SECOND IN THE BETTING THEY HAD AN
INTEREST IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FAVORITE SILAS BROWN THE
TRAINER IS KNOWN TO HAVE HAD LARGE BETS UPON THE EVENT AND HE WAS
NO FRIEND TO POOR STRAKER WE HAVE HOWEVER EXAMINED THE STABLES
AND THERE IS NOTHING TO CONNECT HIM WITH THE AFFAIR
AND NOTHING TO CONNECT THIS MAN SIMPSON WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE
MAPLETON STABLES
NOTHING AT ALL
HOLMES LEANED BACK IN THE CARRIAGE AND THE CONVERSATION CEASED A
FEW MINUTES LATER OUR DRIVER PULLED UP AT A NEAT LITTLE REDBRICK
VILLA WITH OVERHANGING EAVES WHICH STOOD BY THE ROAD SOME DISTANCE
OFF ACROSS A PADDOCK LAY A LONG GRAYTILED OUTBUILDING IN EVERY
OTHER DIRECTION THE LOW CURVES OF THE MOOR BRONZECOLORED FROM THE
FADING FERNS STRETCHED AWAY TO THE SKYLINE BROKEN ONLY BY THE
STEEPLES OF TAVISTOCK AND BY A CLUSTER OF HOUSES AWAY TO THE
WESTWARD WHICH MARKED THE MAPLETON STABLES WE ALL SPRANG OUT WITH
THE EXCEPTION OF HOLMES WHO CONTINUED TO LEAN BACK WITH HIS EYES
FIXED UPON THE SKY IN FRONT OF HIM ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN HIS OWN
THOUGHTS IT WAS ONLY WHEN I TOUCHED HIS ARM THAT HE ROUSED HIMSELF
WITH A VIOLENT START AND STEPPED OUT OF THE CARRIAGE
EXCUSE ME SAID HE TURNING TO COLONEL ROSS WHO HAD LOOKED AT HIM
IN SOME SURPRISE I WAS DAYDREAMING THERE WAS A GLEAM IN HIS EYES
AND A SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT IN HIS MANNER WHICH CONVINCED ME USED AS
I WAS TO HIS WAYS THAT HIS HAND WAS UPON A CLUE THOUGH I COULD NOT
IMAGINE WHERE HE HAD FOUND IT
PERHAPS YOU WOULD PREFER AT ONCE TO GO ON TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
MR HOLMES SAID GREGORY
I THINK THAT I SHOULD PREFER TO STAY HERE A LITTLE AND GO INTO ONE
OR TWO QUESTIONS OF DETAIL STRAKER WAS BROUGHT BACK HERE I
PRESUME
YES HE LIES UPSTAIRS THE INQUEST IS TOMORROW
HE HAS BEEN IN YOUR SERVICE SOME YEARS COLONEL ROSS
I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND HIM AN EXCELLENT SERVANT
I PRESUME THAT YOU MADE AN INVENTORY OF WHAT HE HAD IN THIS POCKETS
AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH INSPECTOR
I HAVE THE THINGS THEMSELVES IN THE SITTINGROOM IF YOU WOULD CARE
TO SEE THEM
I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD WE ALL FILED INTO THE FRONT ROOM AND SAT
ROUND THE CENTRAL TABLE WHILE THE INSPECTOR UNLOCKED A SQUARE TIN BOX
AND LAID A SMALL HEAP OF THINGS BEFORE US THERE WAS A BOX OF VESTAS
TWO INCHES OF TALLOW CANDLE AN A D P BRIERROOT PIPE A POUCH OF
SEALSKIN WITH HALF AN OUNCE OF LONGCUT CAVENDISH A SILVER WATCH
WITH A GOLD CHAIN FIVE SOVEREIGNS IN GOLD AN ALUMINUM PENCILCASE
A FEW PAPERS AND AN IVORYHANDLED KNIFE WITH A VERY DELICATE
INFLEXIBLE BLADE MARKED WEISS CO LONDON
THIS IS A VERY SINGULAR KNIFE SAID HOLMES LIFTING IT UP AND
EXAMINING IT MINUTELY I PRESUME AS I SEE BLOODSTAINS UPON IT
THAT IT IS THE ONE WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE DEAD MANS GRASP WATSON
THIS KNIFE IS SURELY IN YOUR LINE
IT IS WHAT WE CALL A CATARACT KNIFE SAID I
I THOUGHT SO A VERY DELICATE BLADE DEVISED FOR VERY DELICATE WORK
A STRANGE THING FOR A MAN TO CARRY WITH HIM UPON A ROUGH EXPEDITION
ESPECIALLY AS IT WOULD NOT SHUT IN HIS POCKET
THE TIP WAS GUARDED BY A DISK OF CORK WHICH WE FOUND BESIDE HIS
BODY SAID THE INSPECTOR HIS WIFE TELLS US THAT THE KNIFE HAD LAIN
UPON THE DRESSINGTABLE AND THAT HE HAD PICKED IT UP AS HE LEFT THE
ROOM IT WAS A POOR WEAPON BUT PERHAPS THE BEST THAT HE COULD LAY
HIS HANDS ON AT THE MOMENT
VERY POSSIBLE HOW ABOUT THESE PAPERS
THREE OF THEM ARE RECEIPTED HAYDEALERS ACCOUNTS ONE OF THEM IS A
LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS FROM COLONEL ROSS THIS OTHER IS A MILLINERS
ACCOUNT FOR THIRTYSEVEN POUNDS FIFTEEN MADE OUT BY MADAME LESURIER
OF BOND STREET TO WILLIAM DERBYSHIRE MRS STRAKER TELLS US THAT
DERBYSHIRE WAS A FRIEND OF HER HUSBANDS AND THAT OCCASIONALLY HIS
LETTERS WERE ADDRESSED HERE
MADAM DERBYSHIRE HAD SOMEWHAT EXPENSIVE TASTES REMARKED HOLMES
GLANCING DOWN THE ACCOUNT TWENTYTWO GUINEAS IS RATHER HEAVY FOR A
SINGLE COSTUME HOWEVER THERE APPEARS TO BE NOTHING MORE TO LEARN
AND WE MAY NOW GO DOWN TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
AS WE EMERGED FROM THE SITTINGROOM A WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN WAITING IN
THE PASSAGE TOOK A STEP FORWARD AND LAID HER HAND UPON THE
INSPECTORS SLEEVE HER FACE WAS HAGGARD AND THIN AND EAGER STAMPED
WITH THE PRINT OF A RECENT HORROR
HAVE YOU GOT THEM HAVE YOU FOUND THEM SHE PANTED
NO MRS STRAKER BUT MR HOLMES HERE HAS COME FROM LONDON TO HELP
US AND WE SHALL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE
SURELY I MET YOU IN PLYMOUTH AT A GARDENPARTY SOME LITTLE TIME AGO
MRS STRAKER SAID HOLMES
NO SIR YOU ARE MISTAKEN
DEAR ME WHY I COULD HAVE SWORN TO IT YOU WORE A COSTUME OF
DOVECOLORED SILK WITH OSTRICHFEATHER TRIMMING
I NEVER HAD SUCH A DRESS SIR ANSWERED THE LADY
AH THAT QUITE SETTLES IT SAID HOLMES AND WITH AN APOLOGY HE
FOLLOWED THE INSPECTOR OUTSIDE A SHORT WALK ACROSS THE MOOR TOOK US
TO THE HOLLOW IN WHICH THE BODY HAD BEEN FOUND AT THE BRINK OF IT
WAS THE FURZEBUSH UPON WHICH THE COAT HAD BEEN HUNG
THERE WAS NO WIND THAT NIGHT I UNDERSTAND SAID HOLMES
NONE BUT VERY HEAVY RAIN
IN THAT CASE THE OVERCOAT WAS NOT BLOWN AGAINST THE FURZEBUSH BUT
PLACED THERE
YES IT WAS LAID ACROSS THE BUSH
YOU FILL ME WITH INTEREST I PERCEIVE THAT THE GROUND HAS BEEN
TRAMPLED UP A GOOD DEAL NO DOUBT MANY FEET HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE
MONDAY NIGHT
A PIECE OF MATTING HAS BEEN LAID HERE AT THE SIDE AND WE HAVE ALL
STOOD UPON THAT
EXCELLENT
IN THIS BAG I HAVE ONE OF THE BOOTS WHICH STRAKER WORE ONE OF
FITZROY SIMPSONS SHOES AND A CAST HORSESHOE OF SILVER BLAZE
MY DEAR INSPECTOR YOU SURPASS YOURSELF HOLMES TOOK THE BAG AND
DESCENDING INTO THE HOLLOW HE PUSHED THE MATTING INTO A MORE CENTRAL
POSITION THEN STRETCHING HIMSELF UPON HIS FACE AND LEANING HIS CHIN
UPON HIS HANDS HE MADE A CAREFUL STUDY OF THE TRAMPLED MUD IN FRONT
OF HIM HULLO SAID HE SUDDENLY WHATS THIS IT WAS A WAX VESTA
HALF BURNED WHICH WAS SO COATED WITH MUD THAT IT LOOKED AT FIRST
LIKE A LITTLE CHIP OF WOOD
I CANNOT THINK HOW I CAME TO OVERLOOK IT SAID THE INSPECTOR WITH
AN EXPRESSION OF ANNOYANCE
IT WAS INVISIBLE BURIED IN THE MUD I ONLY SAW IT BECAUSE I WAS
LOOKING FOR IT
WHAT YOU EXPECTED TO FIND IT
I THOUGHT IT NOT UNLIKELY
HE TOOK THE BOOTS FROM THE BAG AND COMPARED THE IMPRESSIONS OF EACH
OF THEM WITH MARKS UPON THE GROUND THEN HE CLAMBERED UP TO THE RIM
OF THE HOLLOW AND CRAWLED ABOUT AMONG THE FERNS AND BUSHES
I AM AFRAID THAT THERE ARE NO MORE TRACKS SAID THE INSPECTOR I
HAVE EXAMINED THE GROUND VERY CAREFULLY FOR A HUNDRED YARDS IN EACH
DIRECTION
INDEED SAID HOLMES RISING I SHOULD NOT HAVE THE IMPERTINENCE TO
DO IT AGAIN AFTER WHAT YOU SAY BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE A LITTLE
WALK OVER THE MOOR BEFORE IT GROWS DARK THAT I MAY KNOW MY GROUND
TOMORROW AND I THINK THAT I SHALL PUT THIS HORSESHOE INTO MY POCKET
FOR LUCK
COLONEL ROSS WHO HAD SHOWN SOME SIGNS OF IMPATIENCE AT MY
COMPANIONS QUIET AND SYSTEMATIC METHOD OF WORK GLANCED AT HIS
WATCH I WISH YOU WOULD COME BACK WITH ME INSPECTOR SAID HE
THERE ARE SEVERAL POINTS ON WHICH I SHOULD LIKE YOUR ADVICE AND
ESPECIALLY AS TO WHETHER WE DO NOT OWE IT TO THE PUBLIC TO REMOVE OUR
HORSES NAME FROM THE ENTRIES FOR THE CUP
CERTAINLY NOT CRIED HOLMES WITH DECISION I SHOULD LET THE NAME
STAND
THE COLONEL BOWED I AM VERY GLAD TO HAVE HAD YOUR OPINION SIR
SAID HE YOU WILL FIND US AT POOR STRAKERS HOUSE WHEN YOU HAVE
FINISHED YOUR WALK AND WE CAN DRIVE TOGETHER INTO TAVISTOCK
HE TURNED BACK WITH THE INSPECTOR WHILE HOLMES AND I WALKED SLOWLY
ACROSS THE MOOR THE SUN WAS BEGINNING TO SINK BEHIND THE STABLES OF
MAPLETON AND THE LONG SLOPING PLAIN IN FRONT OF US WAS TINGED WITH
GOLD DEEPENING INTO RICH RUDDY BROWNS WHERE THE FADED FERNS AND
BRAMBLES CAUGHT THE EVENING LIGHT BUT THE GLORIES OF THE LANDSCAPE
WERE ALL WASTED UPON MY COMPANION WHO WAS SUNK IN THE DEEPEST
THOUGHT
ITS THIS WAY WATSON SAID HE AT LAST WE MAY LEAVE THE QUESTION
OF WHO KILLED JOHN STRAKER FOR THE INSTANT AND CONFINE OURSELVES TO
FINDING OUT WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE HORSE NOW SUPPOSING THAT HE
BROKE AWAY DURING OR AFTER THE TRAGEDY WHERE COULD HE HAVE GONE TO
THE HORSE IS A VERY GREGARIOUS CREATURE IF LEFT TO HIMSELF HIS
INSTINCTS WOULD HAVE BEEN EITHER TO RETURN TO KINGS PYLAND OR GO
OVER TO MAPLETON WHY SHOULD HE RUN WILD UPON THE MOOR HE WOULD
SURELY HAVE BEEN SEEN BY NOW AND WHY SHOULD GYPSIES KIDNAP HIM
THESE PEOPLE ALWAYS CLEAR OUT WHEN THEY HEAR OF TROUBLE FOR THEY DO
NOT WISH TO BE PESTERED BY THE POLICE THEY COULD NOT HOPE TO SELL
SUCH A HORSE THEY WOULD RUN A GREAT RISK AND GAIN NOTHING BY TAKING
HIM SURELY THAT IS CLEAR
WHERE IS HE THEN
I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT HE MUST HAVE GONE TO KINGS PYLAND OR TO
MAPLETON HE IS NOT AT KINGS PYLAND THEREFORE HE IS AT MAPLETON
LET US TAKE THAT AS A WORKING HYPOTHESIS AND SEE WHAT IT LEADS US TO
THIS PART OF THE MOOR AS THE INSPECTOR REMARKED IS VERY HARD AND
DRY BUT IT FALLS AWAY TOWARDS MAPLETON AND YOU CAN SEE FROM HERE
THAT THERE IS A LONG HOLLOW OVER YONDER WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN VERY
WET ON MONDAY NIGHT IF OUR SUPPOSITION IS CORRECT THEN THE HORSE
MUST HAVE CROSSED THAT AND THERE IS THE POINT WHERE WE SHOULD LOOK
FOR HIS TRACKS
WE HAD BEEN WALKING BRISKLY DURING THIS CONVERSATION AND A FEW MORE
MINUTES BROUGHT US TO THE HOLLOW IN QUESTION AT HOLMES REQUEST I
WALKED DOWN THE BANK TO THE RIGHT AND HE TO THE LEFT BUT I HAD NOT
TAKEN FIFTY PACES BEFORE I HEARD HIM GIVE A SHOUT AND SAW HIM WAVING
HIS HAND TO ME THE TRACK OF A HORSE WAS PLAINLY OUTLINED IN THE SOFT
EARTH IN FRONT OF HIM AND THE SHOE WHICH HE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET
EXACTLY FITTED THE IMPRESSION
SEE THE VALUE OF IMAGINATION SAID HOLMES IT IS THE ONE QUALITY
WHICH GREGORY LACKS WE IMAGINED WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED ACTED UPON
THE SUPPOSITION AND FIND OURSELVES JUSTIFIED LET US PROCEED
WE CROSSED THE MARSHY BOTTOM AND PASSED OVER A QUARTER OF A MILE OF
DRY HARD TURF AGAIN THE GROUND SLOPED AND AGAIN WE CAME ON THE
TRACKS THEN WE LOST THEM FOR HALF A MILE BUT ONLY TO PICK THEM UP
ONCE MORE QUITE CLOSE TO MAPLETON IT WAS HOLMES WHO SAW THEM FIRST
AND HE STOOD POINTING WITH A LOOK OF TRIUMPH UPON HIS FACE A MANS
TRACK WAS VISIBLE BESIDE THE HORSES
THE HORSE WAS ALONE BEFORE I CRIED
QUITE SO IT WAS ALONE BEFORE HULLO WHAT IS THIS
THE DOUBLE TRACK TURNED SHARP OFF AND TOOK THE DIRECTION OF KINGS
PYLAND HOLMES WHISTLED AND WE BOTH FOLLOWED ALONG AFTER IT HIS
EYES WERE ON THE TRAIL BUT I HAPPENED TO LOOK A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE
AND SAW TO MY SURPRISE THE SAME TRACKS COMING BACK AGAIN IN THE
OPPOSITE DIRECTION
ONE FOR YOU WATSON SAID HOLMES WHEN I POINTED IT OUT YOU HAVE
SAVED US A LONG WALK WHICH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT US BACK ON OUR OWN
TRACES LET US FOLLOW THE RETURN TRACK
WE HAD NOT TO GO FAR IT ENDED AT THE PAVING OF ASPHALT WHICH LED UP
TO THE GATES OF THE MAPLETON STABLES AS WE APPROACHED A GROOM RAN
OUT FROM THEM
WE DONT WANT ANY LOITERERS ABOUT HERE SAID HE
I ONLY WISHED TO ASK A QUESTION SAID HOLMES WITH HIS FINGER AND
THUMB IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET SHOULD I BE TOO EARLY TO SEE YOUR
MASTER MR SILAS BROWN IF I WERE TO CALL AT FIVE OCLOCK TOMORROW
MORNING
BLESS YOU SIR IF ANY ONE IS ABOUT HE WILL BE FOR HE IS ALWAYS THE
FIRST STIRRING BUT HERE HE IS SIR TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS FOR
HIMSELF NO SIR NO IT IS AS MUCH AS MY PLACE IS WORTH TO LET HIM
SEE ME TOUCH YOUR MONEY AFTERWARDS IF YOU LIKE
AS SHERLOCK HOLMES REPLACED THE HALFCROWN WHICH HE HAD DRAWN FROM
HIS POCKET A FIERCELOOKING ELDERLY MAN STRODE OUT FROM THE GATE
WITH A HUNTINGCROP SWINGING IN HIS HAND
WHATS THIS DAWSON HE CRIED NO GOSSIPING GO ABOUT YOUR
BUSINESS AND YOU WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU WANT HERE
TEN MINUTES TALK WITH YOU MY GOOD SIR SAID HOLMES IN THE
SWEETEST OF VOICES
IVE NO TIME TO TALK TO EVERY GADABOUT WE WANT NO STRANGER HERE BE
OFF OR YOU MAY FIND A DOG AT YOUR HEELS
HOLMES LEANED FORWARD AND WHISPERED SOMETHING IN THE TRAINERS EAR
HE STARTED VIOLENTLY AND FLUSHED TO THE TEMPLES
ITS A LIE HE SHOUTED AN INFERNAL LIE
VERY GOOD SHALL WE ARGUE ABOUT IT HERE IN PUBLIC OR TALK IT OVER IN
YOUR PARLOR
OH COME IN IF YOU WISH TO
HOLMES SMILED I SHALL NOT KEEP YOU MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES
WATSON SAID HE NOW MR BROWN I AM QUITE AT YOUR DISPOSAL
IT WAS TWENTY MINUTES AND THE REDS HAD ALL FADED INTO GRAYS BEFORE
HOLMES AND THE TRAINER REAPPEARED NEVER HAVE I SEEN SUCH A CHANGE AS
HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT IN SILAS BROWN IN THAT SHORT TIME HIS FACE
WAS ASHY PALE BEADS OF PERSPIRATION SHONE UPON HIS BROW AND HIS
HANDS SHOOK UNTIL THE HUNTINGCROP WAGGED LIKE A BRANCH IN THE WIND
HIS BULLYING OVERBEARING MANNER WAS ALL GONE TOO AND HE CRINGED
ALONG AT MY COMPANIONS SIDE LIKE A DOG WITH ITS MASTER
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE DONE IT SHALL ALL BE DONE SAID HE
THERE MUST BE NO MISTAKE SAID HOLMES LOOKING ROUND AT HIM THE
OTHER WINCED AS HE READ THE MENACE IN HIS EYES
OH NO THERE SHALL BE NO MISTAKE IT SHALL BE THERE SHOULD I CHANGE
IT FIRST OR NOT
HOLMES THOUGHT A LITTLE AND THEN BURST OUT LAUGHING NO DONT
SAID HE I SHALL WRITE TO YOU ABOUT IT NO TRICKS NOW OR
OH YOU CAN TRUST ME YOU CAN TRUST ME
YES I THINK I CAN WELL YOU SHALL HEAR FROM ME TOMORROW HE
TURNED UPON HIS HEEL DISREGARDING THE TREMBLING HAND WHICH THE OTHER
HELD OUT TO HIM AND WE SET OFF FOR KINGS PYLAND
A MORE PERFECT COMPOUND OF THE BULLY COWARD AND SNEAK THAN MASTER
SILAS BROWN I HAVE SELDOM MET WITH REMARKED HOLMES AS WE TRUDGED
ALONG TOGETHER
HE HAS THE HORSE THEN
HE TRIED TO BLUSTER OUT OF IT BUT I DESCRIBED TO HIM SO EXACTLY
WHAT HIS ACTIONS HAD BEEN UPON THAT MORNING THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT
I WAS WATCHING HIM OF COURSE YOU OBSERVED THE PECULIARLY SQUARE TOES
IN THE IMPRESSIONS AND THAT HIS OWN BOOTS EXACTLY CORRESPONDED TO
THEM AGAIN OF COURSE NO SUBORDINATE WOULD HAVE DARED TO DO SUCH A
THING I DESCRIBED TO HIM HOW WHEN ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM HE WAS
THE FIRST DOWN HE PERCEIVED A STRANGE HORSE WANDERING OVER THE MOOR
HOW HE WENT OUT TO IT AND HIS ASTONISHMENT AT RECOGNIZING FROM THE
WHITE FOREHEAD WHICH HAS GIVEN THE FAVORITE ITS NAME THAT CHANCE HAD
PUT IN HIS POWER THE ONLY HORSE WHICH COULD BEAT THE ONE UPON WHICH
HE HAD PUT HIS MONEY THEN I DESCRIBED HOW HIS FIRST IMPULSE HAD BEEN
TO LEAD HIM BACK TO KINGS PYLAND AND HOW THE DEVIL HAD SHOWN HIM
HOW HE COULD HIDE THE HORSE UNTIL THE RACE WAS OVER AND HOW HE HAD
LED IT BACK AND CONCEALED IT AT MAPLETON WHEN I TOLD HIM EVERY
DETAIL HE GAVE IT UP AND THOUGHT ONLY OF SAVING HIS OWN SKIN
BUT HIS STABLES HAD BEEN SEARCHED
OH AND OLD HORSEFAKER LIKE HIM HAS MANY A DODGE
BUT ARE YOU NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE THE HORSE IN HIS POWER NOW SINCE HE
HAS EVERY INTEREST IN INJURING IT
MY DEAR FELLOW HE WILL GUARD IT AS THE APPLE OF HIS EYE HE KNOWS
THAT HIS ONLY HOPE OF MERCY IS TO PRODUCE IT SAFE
COLONEL ROSS DID NOT IMPRESS ME AS A MAN WHO WOULD BE LIKELY TO SHOW
MUCH MERCY IN ANY CASE
THE MATTER DOES NOT REST WITH COLONEL ROSS I FOLLOW MY OWN METHODS
AND TELL AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE AS I CHOOSE THAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF
BEING UNOFFICIAL I DONT KNOW WHETHER YOU OBSERVED IT WATSON BUT
THE COLONELS MANNER HAS BEEN JUST A TRIFLE CAVALIER TO ME I AM
INCLINED NOW TO HAVE A LITTLE AMUSEMENT AT HIS EXPENSE SAY NOTHING
TO HIM ABOUT THE HORSE
CERTAINLY NOT WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION
AND OF COURSE THIS IS ALL QUITE A MINOR POINT COMPARED TO THE
QUESTION OF WHO KILLED JOHN STRAKER
AND YOU WILL DEVOTE YOURSELF TO THAT
ON THE CONTRARY WE BOTH GO BACK TO LONDON BY THE NIGHT TRAIN
I WAS THUNDERSTRUCK BY MY FRIENDS WORDS WE HAD ONLY BEEN A FEW
HOURS IN DEVONSHIRE AND THAT HE SHOULD GIVE UP AN INVESTIGATION
WHICH HE HAD BEGUN SO BRILLIANTLY WAS QUITE INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME
NOT A WORD MORE COULD I DRAW FROM HIM UNTIL WE WERE BACK AT THE
TRAINERS HOUSE THE COLONEL AND THE INSPECTOR WERE AWAITING US IN
THE PARLOR
MY FRIEND AND I RETURN TO TOWN BY THE NIGHTEXPRESS SAID HOLMES
WE HAVE HAD A CHARMING LITTLE BREATH OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL DARTMOOR
AIR
THE INSPECTOR OPENED HIS EYES AND THE COLONELS LIP CURLED IN A
SNEER
SO YOU DESPAIR OF ARRESTING THE MURDERER OF POOR STRAKER SAID HE
HOLMES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS THERE ARE CERTAINLY GRAVE
DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY SAID HE I HAVE EVERY HOPE HOWEVER THAT
YOUR HORSE WILL START UPON TUESDAY AND I BEG THAT YOU WILL HAVE YOUR
JOCKEY IN READINESS MIGHT I ASK FOR A PHOTOGRAPH OF MR JOHN
STRAKER
THE INSPECTOR TOOK ONE FROM AN ENVELOPE AND HANDED IT TO HIM
MY DEAR GREGORY YOU ANTICIPATE ALL MY WANTS IF I MIGHT ASK YOU TO
WAIT HERE FOR AN INSTANT I HAVE A QUESTION WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TO
PUT TO THE MAID
I MUST SAY THAT I AM RATHER DISAPPOINTED IN OUR LONDON CONSULTANT
SAID COLONEL ROSS BLUNTLY AS MY FRIEND LEFT THE ROOM I DO NOT SEE
THAT WE ARE ANY FURTHER THAN WHEN HE CAME
AT LEAST YOU HAVE HIS ASSURANCE THAT YOUR HORSE WILL RUN SAID I
YES I HAVE HIS ASSURANCE SAID THE COLONEL WITH A SHRUG OF HIS
SHOULDERS I SHOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE HORSE
I WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME REPLY IN DEFENCE OF MY FRIEND WHEN HE
ENTERED THE ROOM AGAIN
NOW GENTLEMEN SAID HE I AM QUITE READY FOR TAVISTOCK
AS WE STEPPED INTO THE CARRIAGE ONE OF THE STABLELADS HELD THE DOOR
OPEN FOR US A SUDDEN IDEA SEEMED TO OCCUR TO HOLMES FOR HE LEANED
FORWARD AND TOUCHED THE LAD UPON THE SLEEVE
YOU HAVE A FEW SHEEP IN THE PADDOCK HE SAID WHO ATTENDS TO
THEM
I DO SIR
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANYTHING AMISS WITH THEM OF LATE
WELL SIR NOT OF MUCH ACCOUNT BUT THREE OF THEM HAVE GONE LAME
SIR
I COULD SEE THAT HOLMES WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED FOR HE CHUCKLED AND
RUBBED HIS HANDS TOGETHER
A LONG SHOT WATSON A VERY LONG SHOT SAID HE PINCHING MY ARM
GREGORY LET ME RECOMMEND TO YOUR ATTENTION THIS SINGULAR EPIDEMIC
AMONG THE SHEEP DRIVE ON COACHMAN
COLONEL ROSS STILL WORE AN EXPRESSION WHICH SHOWED THE POOR OPINION
WHICH HE HAD FORMED OF MY COMPANIONS ABILITY BUT I SAW BY THE
INSPECTORS FACE THAT HIS ATTENTION HAD BEEN KEENLY AROUSED
YOU CONSIDER THAT TO BE IMPORTANT HE ASKED
EXCEEDINGLY SO
IS THERE ANY POINT TO WHICH YOU WOULD WISH TO DRAW MY ATTENTION
TO THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHTTIME
THE DOG DID NOTHING IN THE NIGHTTIME
THAT WAS THE CURIOUS INCIDENT REMARKED SHERLOCK HOLMES
FOUR DAYS LATER HOLMES AND I WERE AGAIN IN THE TRAIN BOUND FOR
WINCHESTER TO SEE THE RACE FOR THE WESSEX CUP COLONEL ROSS MET US BY
APPOINTMENT OUTSIDE THE STATION AND WE DROVE IN HIS DRAG TO THE
COURSE BEYOND THE TOWN HIS FACE WAS GRAVE AND HIS MANNER WAS COLD
IN THE EXTREME
I HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF MY HORSE SAID HE
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU WOULD KNOW HIM WHEN YOU SAW HIM ASKED HOLMES
THE COLONEL WAS VERY ANGRY I HAVE BEEN ON THE TURF FOR TWENTY
YEARS AND NEVER WAS ASKED SUCH A QUESTION AS THAT BEFORE SAID HE
A CHILD WOULD KNOW SILVER BLAZE WITH HIS WHITE FOREHEAD AND HIS
MOTTLED OFFFORELEG
HOW IS THE BETTING
WELL THAT IS THE CURIOUS PART OF IT YOU COULD HAVE GOT FIFTEEN TO
ONE YESTERDAY BUT THE PRICE HAS BECOME SHORTER AND SHORTER UNTIL
YOU CAN HARDLY GET THREE TO ONE NOW
HUM SAID HOLMES SOMEBODY KNOWS SOMETHING THAT IS CLEAR
AS THE DRAG DREW UP IN THE ENCLOSURE NEAR THE GRAND STAND I GLANCED
AT THE CARD TO SEE THE ENTRIES
WESSEX PLATE IT RAN SOVS EACH H FT WITH SOVS ADDED FOR
FOUR AND FIVE YEAR OLDS SECOND THIRD NEW COURSE ONE
MILE AND FIVE FURLONGS
MR HEATH NEWTONS THE NEGRO RED CAP CINNAMON JACKET
COLONEL WARDLAWS PUGILIST PINK CAP BLUE AND BLACK JACKET
LORD BACKWATERS DESBOROUGH YELLOW CAP AND SLEEVES
COLONEL ROSSS SILVER BLAZE BLACK CAP RED JACKET
DUKE OF BALMORALS IRIS YELLOW AND BLACK STRIPES
LORD SINGLEFORDS RASPER PURPLE CAP BLACK SLEEVES
WE SCRATCHED OUR OTHER ONE AND PUT ALL HOPES ON YOUR WORD SAID
THE COLONEL WHY WHAT IS THAT SILVER BLAZE FAVORITE
FIVE TO FOUR AGAINST SILVER BLAZE ROARED THE RING FIVE TO FOUR
AGAINST SILVER BLAZE FIVE TO FIFTEEN AGAINST DESBOROUGH FIVE TO
FOUR ON THE FIELD
THERE ARE THE NUMBERS UP I CRIED THEY ARE ALL SIX THERE
ALL SIX THERE THEN MY HORSE IS RUNNING CRIED THE COLONEL IN GREAT
AGITATION BUT I DONT SEE HIM MY COLORS HAVE NOT PASSED
ONLY FIVE HAVE PASSED THIS MUST BE HE
AS I SPOKE A POWERFUL BAY HORSE SWEPT OUT FROM THE WEIGHTING
ENCLOSURE AND CANTERED PAST US BEARING ON ITS BACK THE WELLKNOWN
BLACK AND RED OF THE COLONEL
THATS NOT MY HORSE CRIED THE OWNER THAT BEAST HAS NOT A WHITE
HAIR UPON ITS BODY WHAT IS THIS THAT YOU HAVE DONE MR HOLMES
WELL WELL LET US SEE HOW HE GETS ON SAID MY FRIEND
IMPERTURBABLY FOR A FEW MINUTES HE GAZED THROUGH MY FIELDGLASS
CAPITAL AN EXCELLENT START HE CRIED SUDDENLY THERE THEY ARE
COMING ROUND THE CURVE
FROM OUR DRAG WE HAD A SUPERB VIEW AS THEY CAME UP THE STRAIGHT THE
SIX HORSES WERE SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT A CARPET COULD HAVE COVERED
THEM BUT HALF WAY UP THE YELLOW OF THE MAPLETON STABLE SHOWED TO THE
FRONT BEFORE THEY REACHED US HOWEVER DESBOROUGHS BOLT WAS SHOT
AND THE COLONELS HORSE COMING AWAY WITH A RUSH PASSED THE POST A
GOOD SIX LENGTHS BEFORE ITS RIVAL THE DUKE OF BALMORALS IRIS MAKING
A BAD THIRD
ITS MY RACE ANYHOW GASPED THE COLONEL PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS
EYES I CONFESS THAT I CAN MAKE NEITHER HEAD NOR TAIL OF IT DONT
YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE KEPT UP YOUR MYSTERY LONG ENOUGH MR
HOLMES
CERTAINLY COLONEL YOU SHALL KNOW EVERYTHING LET US ALL GO ROUND
AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE HORSE TOGETHER HERE HE IS HE CONTINUED AS
WE MADE OUR WAY INTO THE WEIGHING ENCLOSURE WHERE ONLY OWNERS AND
THEIR FRIENDS FIND ADMITTANCE YOU HAVE ONLY TO WASH HIS FACE AND
HIS LEG IN SPIRITS OF WINE AND YOU WILL FIND THAT HE IS THE SAME OLD
SILVER BLAZE AS EVER
YOU TAKE MY BREATH AWAY
I FOUND HIM IN THE HANDS OF A FAKER AND TOOK THE LIBERTY OF RUNNING
HIM JUST AS HE WAS SENT OVER
MY DEAR SIR YOU HAVE DONE WONDERS THE HORSE LOOKS VERY FIT AND
WELL IT NEVER WENT BETTER IN ITS LIFE I OWE YOU A THOUSAND
APOLOGIES FOR HAVING DOUBTED YOUR ABILITY YOU HAVE DONE ME A GREAT
SERVICE BY RECOVERING MY HORSE YOU WOULD DO ME A GREATER STILL IF
YOU COULD LAY YOUR HANDS ON THE MURDERER OF JOHN STRAKER
I HAVE DONE SO SAID HOLMES QUIETLY
THE COLONEL AND I STARED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT YOU HAVE GOT HIM
WHERE IS HE THEN
HE IS HERE
HERE WHERE
IN MY COMPANY AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
THE COLONEL FLUSHED ANGRILY I QUITE RECOGNIZE THAT I AM UNDER
OBLIGATIONS TO YOU MR HOLMES SAID HE BUT I MUST REGARD WHAT YOU
HAVE JUST SAID AS EITHER A VERY BAD JOKE OR AN INSULT
SHERLOCK HOLMES LAUGHED I ASSURE YOU THAT I HAVE NOT ASSOCIATED YOU
WITH THE CRIME COLONEL SAID HE THE REAL MURDERER IS STANDING
IMMEDIATELY BEHIND YOU HE STEPPED PAST AND LAID HIS HAND UPON THE
GLOSSY NECK OF THE THOROUGHBRED
THE HORSE CRIED BOTH THE COLONEL AND MYSELF
YES THE HORSE AND IT MAY LESSEN HIS GUILT IF I SAY THAT IT WAS
DONE IN SELFDEFENCE AND THAT JOHN STRAKER WAS A MAN WHO WAS
ENTIRELY UNWORTHY OF YOUR CONFIDENCE BUT THERE GOES THE BELL AND AS
I STAND TO WIN A LITTLE ON THIS NEXT RACE I SHALL DEFER A LENGTHY
EXPLANATION UNTIL A MORE FITTING TIME
WE HAD THE CORNER OF A PULLMAN CAR TO OURSELVES THAT EVENING AS WE
WHIRLED BACK TO LONDON AND I FANCY THAT THE JOURNEY WAS A SHORT ONE
TO COLONEL ROSS AS WELL AS TO MYSELF AS WE LISTENED TO OUR
COMPANIONS NARRATIVE OF THE EVENTS WHICH HAD OCCURRED AT THE
DARTMOOR TRAININGSTABLES UPON THE MONDAY NIGHT AND THE MEANS BY
WHICH HE HAD UNRAVELLED THEM
I CONFESS SAID HE THAT ANY THEORIES WHICH I HAD FORMED FROM THE
NEWSPAPER REPORTS WERE ENTIRELY ERRONEOUS AND YET THERE WERE
INDICATIONS THERE HAD THEY NOT BEEN OVERLAID BY OTHER DETAILS WHICH
CONCEALED THEIR TRUE IMPORT I WENT TO DEVONSHIRE WITH THE CONVICTION
THAT FITZROY SIMPSON WAS THE TRUE CULPRIT ALTHOUGH OF COURSE I SAW
THAT THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM WAS BY NO MEANS COMPLETE IT WAS WHILE
I WAS IN THE CARRIAGE JUST AS WE REACHED THE TRAINERS HOUSE THAT
THE IMMENSE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CURRIED MUTTON OCCURRED TO ME YOU
MAY REMEMBER THAT I WAS DISTRAIT AND REMAINED SITTING AFTER YOU HAD
ALL ALIGHTED I WAS MARVELLING IN MY OWN MIND HOW I COULD POSSIBLY
HAVE OVERLOOKED SO OBVIOUS A CLUE
I CONFESS SAID THE COLONEL THAT EVEN NOW I CANNOT SEE HOW IT
HELPS US
IT WAS THE FIRST LINK IN MY CHAIN OF REASONING POWDERED OPIUM IS BY
NO MEANS TASTELESS THE FLAVOR IS NOT DISAGREEABLE BUT IT IS
PERCEPTIBLE WERE IT MIXED WITH ANY ORDINARY DISH THE EATER WOULD
UNDOUBTEDLY DETECT IT AND WOULD PROBABLY EAT NO MORE A CURRY WAS
EXACTLY THE MEDIUM WHICH WOULD DISGUISE THIS TASTE BY NO POSSIBLE
SUPPOSITION COULD THIS STRANGER FITZROY SIMPSON HAVE CAUSED CURRY
TO BE SERVED IN THE TRAINERS FAMILY THAT NIGHT AND IT IS SURELY TOO
MONSTROUS A COINCIDENCE TO SUPPOSE THAT HE HAPPENED TO COME ALONG
WITH POWDERED OPIUM UPON THE VERY NIGHT WHEN A DISH HAPPENED TO BE
SERVED WHICH WOULD DISGUISE THE FLAVOR THAT IS UNTHINKABLE
THEREFORE SIMPSON BECOMES ELIMINATED FROM THE CASE AND OUR ATTENTION
CENTERS UPON STRAKER AND HIS WIFE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE
CHOSEN CURRIED MUTTON FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT THE OPIUM WAS ADDED
AFTER THE DISH WAS SET ASIDE FOR THE STABLEBOY FOR THE OTHERS HAD
THE SAME FOR SUPPER WITH NO ILL EFFECTS WHICH OF THEM THEN HAD
ACCESS TO THAT DISH WITHOUT THE MAID SEEING THEM
BEFORE DECIDING THAT QUESTION I HAD GRASPED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
SILENCE OF THE DOG FOR ONE TRUE INFERENCE INVARIABLY SUGGESTS
OTHERS THE SIMPSON INCIDENT HAD SHOWN ME THAT A DOG WAS KEPT IN THE
STABLES AND YET THOUGH SOME ONE HAD BEEN IN AND HAD FETCHED OUT A
HORSE HE HAD NOT BARKED ENOUGH TO AROUSE THE TWO LADS IN THE LOFT
OBVIOUSLY THE MIDNIGHT VISITOR WAS SOME ONE WHOM THE DOG KNEW WELL
I WAS ALREADY CONVINCED OR ALMOST CONVINCED THAT JOHN STRAKER WENT
DOWN TO THE STABLES IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT AND TOOK OUT SILVER
BLAZE FOR WHAT PURPOSE FOR A DISHONEST ONE OBVIOUSLY OR WHY
SHOULD HE DRUG HIS OWN STABLEBOY AND YET I WAS AT A LOSS TO KNOW
WHY THERE HAVE BEEN CASES BEFORE NOW WHERE TRAINERS HAVE MADE SURE
OF GREAT SUMS OF MONEY BY LAYING AGAINST THEIR OWN HORSES THROUGH
AGENTS AND THEN PREVENTING THEM FROM WINNING BY FRAUD SOMETIMES IT
IS A PULLING JOCKEY SOMETIMES IT IS SOME SURER AND SUBTLER MEANS
WHAT WAS IT HERE I HOPED THAT THE CONTENTS OF HIS POCKETS MIGHT HELP
ME TO FORM A CONCLUSION
AND THEY DID SO YOU CANNOT HAVE FORGOTTEN THE SINGULAR KNIFE WHICH
WAS FOUND IN THE DEAD MANS HAND A KNIFE WHICH CERTAINLY NO SANE MAN
WOULD CHOOSE FOR A WEAPON IT WAS AS DR WATSON TOLD US A FORM OF
KNIFE WHICH IS USED FOR THE MOST DELICATE OPERATIONS KNOWN IN
SURGERY AND IT WAS TO BE USED FOR A DELICATE OPERATION THAT NIGHT
YOU MUST KNOW WITH YOUR WIDE EXPERIENCE OF TURF MATTERS COLONEL
ROSS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE A SLIGHT NICK UPON THE TENDONS OF A
HORSES HAM AND TO DO IT SUBCUTANEOUSLY SO AS TO LEAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO TRACE A HORSE SO TREATED WOULD DEVELOP A SLIGHT LAMENESS WHICH
WOULD BE PUT DOWN TO A STRAIN IN EXERCISE OR A TOUCH OF RHEUMATISM
BUT NEVER TO FOUL PLAY
VILLAIN SCOUNDREL CRIED THE COLONEL
WE HAVE HERE THE EXPLANATION OF WHY JOHN STRAKER WISHED TO TAKE THE
HORSE OUT ON TO THE MOOR SO SPIRITED A CREATURE WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY
ROUSED THE SOUNDEST OF SLEEPERS WHEN IT FELT THE PRICK OF THE KNIFE
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO DO IT IN THE OPEN AIR
I HAVE BEEN BLIND CRIED THE COLONEL OF COURSE THAT WAS WHY HE
NEEDED THE CANDLE AND STRUCK THE MATCH
UNDOUBTEDLY BUT IN EXAMINING HIS BELONGINGS I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO DISCOVER NOT ONLY THE METHOD OF THE CRIME BUT EVEN ITS MOTIVES
AS A MAN OF THE WORLD COLONEL YOU KNOW THAT MEN DO NOT CARRY OTHER
PEOPLES BILLS ABOUT IN THEIR POCKETS WE HAVE MOST OF US QUITE
ENOUGH TO DO TO SETTLE OUR OWN I AT ONCE CONCLUDED THAT STRAKER WAS
LEADING A DOUBLE LIFE AND KEEPING A SECOND ESTABLISHMENT THE NATURE
OF THE BILL SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A LADY IN THE CASE AND ONE WHO HAD
EXPENSIVE TASTES LIBERAL AS YOU ARE WITH YOUR SERVANTS ONE CAN
HARDLY EXPECT THAT THEY CAN BUY TWENTYGUINEA WALKING DRESSES FOR
THEIR LADIES I QUESTIONED MRS STRAKER AS TO THE DRESS WITHOUT HER
KNOWING IT AND HAVING SATISFIED MYSELF THAT IT HAD NEVER REACHED
HER I MADE A NOTE OF THE MILLINERS ADDRESS AND FELT THAT BY
CALLING THERE WITH STRAKERS PHOTOGRAPH I COULD EASILY DISPOSE OF THE
MYTHICAL DERBYSHIRE
FROM THAT TIME ON ALL WAS PLAIN STRAKER HAD LED OUT THE HORSE TO A
HOLLOW WHERE HIS LIGHT WOULD BE INVISIBLE SIMPSON IN HIS FLIGHT HAD
DROPPED HIS CRAVAT AND STRAKER HAD PICKED IT UPWITH SOME IDEA
PERHAPS THAT HE MIGHT USE IT IN SECURING THE HORSES LEG ONCE IN
THE HOLLOW HE HAD GOT BEHIND THE HORSE AND HAD STRUCK A LIGHT BUT
THE CREATURE FRIGHTENED AT THE SUDDEN GLARE AND WITH THE STRANGE
INSTINCT OF ANIMALS FEELING THAT SOME MISCHIEF WAS INTENDED HAD
LASHED OUT AND THE STEEL SHOE HAD STRUCK STRAKER FULL ON THE
FOREHEAD HE HAD ALREADY IN SPITE OF THE RAIN TAKEN OFF HIS
OVERCOAT IN ORDER TO DO HIS DELICATE TASK AND SO AS HE FELL HIS
KNIFE GASHED HIS THIGH DO I MAKE IT CLEAR
WONDERFUL CRIED THE COLONEL WONDERFUL YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN
THERE
MY FINAL SHOT WAS I CONFESS A VERY LONG ONE IT STRUCK ME THAT SO
ASTUTE A MAN AS STRAKER WOULD NOT UNDERTAKE THIS DELICATE
TENDONNICKING WITHOUT A LITTLE PRACTICE WHAT COULD HE PRACTICE ON
MY EYES FELL UPON THE SHEEP AND I ASKED A QUESTION WHICH RATHER TO
MY SURPRISE SHOWED THAT MY SURMISE WAS CORRECT
WHEN I RETURNED TO LONDON I CALLED UPON THE MILLINER WHO HAD
RECOGNIZED STRAKER AS AN EXCELLENT CUSTOMER OF THE NAME OF
DERBYSHIRE WHO HAD A VERY DASHING WIFE WITH A STRONG PARTIALITY FOR
EXPENSIVE DRESSES I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THIS WOMAN HAD PLUNGED HIM
OVER HEAD AND EARS IN DEBT AND SO LED HIM INTO THIS MISERABLE PLOT
YOU HAVE EXPLAINED ALL BUT ONE THING CRIED THE COLONEL WHERE WAS
THE HORSE
AH IT BOLTED AND WAS CARED FOR BY ONE OF YOUR NEIGHBORS WE MUST
HAVE AN AMNESTY IN THAT DIRECTION I THINK THIS IS CLAPHAM JUNCTION
IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN AND WE SHALL BE IN VICTORIA IN LESS THAN TEN
MINUTES IF YOU CARE TO SMOKE A CIGAR IN OUR ROOMS COLONEL I SHALL
BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU ANY OTHER DETAILS WHICH MIGHT INTEREST YOU
THE YELLOW FACE
IN PUBLISHING THESE SHORT SKETCHES BASED UPON THE NUMEROUS CASES IN
WHICH MY COMPANIONS SINGULAR GIFTS HAVE MADE US THE LISTENERS TO
AND EVENTUALLY THE ACTORS IN SOME STRANGE DRAMA IT IS ONLY NATURAL
THAT I SHOULD DWELL RATHER UPON HIS SUCCESSES THAN UPON HIS FAILURES
AND THIS NOT SO MUCH FOR THE SAKE OF HIS REPUTATIONSFOR INDEED IT
WAS WHEN HE WAS AT HIS WITS END THAT HIS ENERGY AND HIS VERSATILITY
WERE MOST ADMIRABLEBUT BECAUSE WHERE HE FAILED IT HAPPENED TOO
OFTEN THAT NO ONE ELSE SUCCEEDED AND THAT THE TALE WAS LEFT FOREVER
WITHOUT A CONCLUSION NOW AND AGAIN HOWEVER IT CHANCED THAT EVEN
WHEN HE ERRED THE TRUTH WAS STILL DISCOVERED I HAVE NOTED OF SOME
HALFDOZEN CASES OF THE KIND OF WHICH THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE
RITUAL AND THAT WHICH I AM ABOUT TO RECOUNT ARE THE TWO WHICH
PRESENT THE STRONGEST FEATURES OF INTEREST
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS A MAN WHO SELDOM TOOK EXERCISE FOR EXERCISES
SAKE FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT AND HE WAS
UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER
SEEN BUT HE LOOKED UPON AIMLESS BODILY EXERTION AS A WASTE OF
ENERGY AND HE SELDOM BESTIRRED HIMSELF SAVE WHEN THERE WAS SOME
PROFESSIONAL OBJECT TO BE SERVED THEN HE WAS ABSOLUTELY UNTIRING AND
INDEFATIGABLE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE KEPT HIMSELF IN TRAINING UNDER
SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IS REMARKABLE BUT HIS DIET WAS USUALLY OF THE
SPAREST AND HIS HABITS WERE SIMPLE TO THE VERGE OF AUSTERITY SAVE
FOR THE OCCASIONAL USE OF COCAINE HE HAD NO VICES AND HE ONLY
TURNED TO THE DRUG AS A PROTEST AGAINST THE MONOTONY OF EXISTENCE
WHEN CASES WERE SCANTY AND THE PAPERS UNINTERESTING
ONE DAY IN EARLY SPRING HE HAD SO FAR RELAXED AS TO GO FOR A WALK
WITH ME IN THE PARK WHERE THE FIRST FAINT SHOOTS OF GREEN WERE
BREAKING OUT UPON THE ELMS AND THE STICKY SPEARHEADS OF THE
CHESTNUTS WERE JUST BEGINNING TO BURST INTO THEIR FIVEFOLD LEAVES
FOR TWO HOURS WE RAMBLED ABOUT TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR THE MOST
PART AS BEFITS TWO MEN WHO KNOW EACH OTHER INTIMATELY IT WAS NEARLY
FIVE BEFORE WE WERE BACK IN BAKER STREET ONCE MORE
BEG PARDON SIR SAID OUR PAGEBOY AS HE OPENED THE DOOR THERES
BEEN A GENTLEMAN HERE ASKING FOR YOU SIR
HOLMES GLANCED REPROACHFULLY AT ME SO MUCH FOR AFTERNOON WALKS
SAID HE HAS THIS GENTLEMAN GONE THEN
YES SIR
DIDNT YOU ASK HIM IN
YES SIR HE CAME IN
HOW LONG DID HE WAIT
HALF AN HOUR SIR HE WAS A VERY RESTLESS GENTLEMAN SIR AWALKIN
AND ASTAMPIN ALL THE TIME HE WAS HERE I WAS WAITIN OUTSIDE THE
DOOR SIR AND I COULD HEAR HIM AT LAST HE OUTS INTO THE PASSAGE
AND HE CRIES IS THAT MAN NEVER GOIN TO COME THOSE WERE HIS VERY
WORDS SIR YOULL ONLY NEED TO WAIT A LITTLE LONGER SAYS I THEN
ILL WAIT IN THE OPEN AIR FOR I FEEL HALF CHOKED SAYS HE ILL BE
BACK BEFORE LONG AND WITH THAT HE UPS AND HE OUTS AND ALL I COULD
SAY WOULDNT HOLD HIM BACK
WELL WELL YOU DID YOUR BEST SAID HOLMES AS WE WALKED INTO OUR
ROOM ITS VERY ANNOYING THOUGH WATSON I WAS BADLY IN NEED OF A
CASE AND THIS LOOKS FROM THE MANS IMPATIENCE AS IF IT WERE OF
IMPORTANCE HULLO THATS NOT YOUR PIPE ON THE TABLE HE MUST HAVE
LEFT HIS BEHIND HIM A NICE OLD BRIER WITH A GOOD LONG STEM OF WHAT
THE TOBACCONISTS CALL AMBER I WONDER HOW MANY REAL AMBER MOUTHPIECES
THERE ARE IN LONDON SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT A FLY IN IT IS A SIGN
WELL HE MUST HAVE BEEN DISTURBED IN HIS MIND TO LEAVE A PIPE BEHIND
HIM WHICH HE EVIDENTLY VALUES HIGHLY
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT HE VALUES IT HIGHLY I ASKED
WELL I SHOULD PUT THE ORIGINAL COST OF THE PIPE AT SEVEN AND
SIXPENCE NOW IT HAS YOU SEE BEEN TWICE MENDED ONCE IN THE WOODEN
STEM AND ONCE IN THE AMBER EACH OF THESE MENDS DONE AS YOU
OBSERVE WITH SILVER BANDS MUST HAVE COST MORE THAN THE PIPE DID
ORIGINALLY THE MAN MUST VALUE THE PIPE HIGHLY WHEN HE PREFERS TO
PATCH IT UP RATHER THAN BUY A NEW ONE WITH THE SAME MONEY
ANYTHING ELSE I ASKED FOR HOLMES WAS TURNING THE PIPE ABOUT IN
HIS HAND AND STARING AT IT IN HIS PECULIAR PENSIVE WAY
HE HELD IT UP AND TAPPED ON IT WITH HIS LONG THIN FOREFINGER AS A
PROFESSOR MIGHT WHO WAS LECTURING ON A BONE
PIPES ARE OCCASIONALLY OF EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST SAID HE NOTHING
HAS MORE INDIVIDUALITY SAVE PERHAPS WATCHES AND BOOTLACES THE
INDICATIONS HERE HOWEVER ARE NEITHER VERY MARKED NOR VERY
IMPORTANT THE OWNER IS OBVIOUSLY A MUSCULAR MAN LEFTHANDED WITH
AN EXCELLENT SET OF TEETH CARELESS IN HIS HABITS AND WITH NO NEED
TO PRACTISE ECONOMY
MY FRIEND THREW OUT THE INFORMATION IN A VERY OFFHAND WAY BUT I SAW
THAT HE COCKED HIS EYE AT ME TO SEE IF I HAD FOLLOWED HIS REASONING
YOU THINK A MAN MUST BE WELLTODO IF HE SMOKES A SEVENSHILLING
PIPE SAID I
THIS IS GROSVENOR MIXTURE AT EIGHTPENCE AN OUNCE HOLMES ANSWERED
KNOCKING A LITTLE OUT ON HIS PALM AS HE MIGHT GET AN EXCELLENT
SMOKE FOR HALF THE PRICE HE HAS NO NEED TO PRACTISE ECONOMY
AND THE OTHER POINTS
HE HAS BEEN IN THE HABIT OF LIGHTING HIS PIPE AT LAMPS AND GASJETS
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS QUITE CHARRED ALL DOWN ONE SIDE OF COURSE A
MATCH COULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT WHY SHOULD A MAN HOLD A MATCH TO THE
SIDE OF HIS PIPE BUT YOU CANNOT LIGHT IT AT A LAMP WITHOUT GETTING
THE BOWL CHARRED AND IT IS ALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PIPE FROM
THAT I GATHER THAT HE IS A LEFTHANDED MAN YOU HOLD YOUR OWN PIPE TO
THE LAMP AND SEE HOW NATURALLY YOU BEING RIGHTHANDED HOLD THE
LEFT SIDE TO THE FLAME YOU MIGHT DO IT ONCE THE OTHER WAY BUT NOT
AS A CONSTANCY THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN HELD SO THEN HE HAS BITTEN
THROUGH HIS AMBER IT TAKES A MUSCULAR ENERGETIC FELLOW AND ONE
WITH A GOOD SET OF TEETH TO DO THAT BUT IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN I HEAR
HIM UPON THE STAIR SO WE SHALL HAVE SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING THAN
HIS PIPE TO STUDY
AN INSTANT LATER OUR DOOR OPENED AND A TALL YOUNG MAN ENTERED THE
ROOM HE WAS WELL BUT QUIETLY DRESSED IN A DARKGRAY SUIT AND
CARRIED A BROWN WIDEAWAKE IN HIS HAND I SHOULD HAVE PUT HIM AT
ABOUT THIRTY THOUGH HE WAS REALLY SOME YEARS OLDER
I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID HE WITH SOME EMBARRASSMENT I SUPPOSE I
SHOULD HAVE KNOCKED YES OF COURSE I SHOULD HAVE KNOCKED THE FACT
IS THAT I AM A LITTLE UPSET AND YOU MUST PUT IT ALL DOWN TO THAT
HE PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MAN WHO IS HALF DAZED
AND THEN FELL RATHER THAN SAT DOWN UPON A CHAIR
I CAN SEE THAT YOU HAVE NOT SLEPT FOR A NIGHT OR TWO SAID HOLMES
IN HIS EASY GENIAL WAY THAT TRIES A MANS NERVES MORE THAN WORK
AND MORE EVEN THAN PLEASURE MAY I ASK HOW I CAN HELP YOU
I WANTED YOUR ADVICE SIR I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO AND MY WHOLE LIFE
SEEMS TO HAVE GONE TO PIECES
YOU WISH TO EMPLOY ME AS A CONSULTING DETECTIVE
NOT THAT ONLY I WANT YOUR OPINION AS A JUDICIOUS MANAS A MAN OF
THE WORLD I WANT TO KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO DO NEXT I HOPE TO GOD
YOULL BE ABLE TO TELL ME
HE SPOKE IN LITTLE SHARP JERKY OUTBURSTS AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT
TO SPEAK AT ALL WAS VERY PAINFUL TO HIM AND THAT HIS WILL ALL
THROUGH WAS OVERRIDING HIS INCLINATIONS
ITS A VERY DELICATE THING SAID HE ONE DOES NOT LIKE TO SPEAK OF
ONES DOMESTIC AFFAIRS TO STRANGERS IT SEEMS DREADFUL TO DISCUSS THE
CONDUCT OF ONES WIFE WITH TWO MEN WHOM I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
ITS HORRIBLE TO HAVE TO DO IT BUT IVE GOT TO THE END OF MY TETHER
AND I MUST HAVE ADVICE
MY DEAR MR GRANT MUNRO BEGAN HOLMES
OUR VISITOR SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR WHAT HE CRIED YOU KNOW MY
NAME
IF YOU WISH TO PRESERVE YOUR INCOGNITO SAID HOLMES SMILING I
WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU CEASE TO WRITE YOUR NAME UPON THE LINING OF
YOUR HAT OR ELSE THAT YOU TURN THE CROWN TOWARDS THE PERSON WHOM YOU
ARE ADDRESSING I WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT MY FRIEND AND I HAVE LISTENED
TO A GOOD MANY STRANGE SECRETS IN THIS ROOM AND THAT WE HAVE HAD THE
GOOD FORTUNE TO BRING PEACE TO MANY TROUBLED SOULS I TRUST THAT WE
MAY DO AS MUCH FOR YOU MIGHT I BEG YOU AS TIME MAY PROVE TO BE OF
IMPORTANCE TO FURNISH ME WITH THE FACTS OF YOUR CASE WITHOUT FURTHER
DELAY
OUR VISITOR AGAIN PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS FOREHEAD AS IF HE FOUND
IT BITTERLY HARD FROM EVERY GESTURE AND EXPRESSION I COULD SEE THAT
HE WAS A RESERVED SELFCONTAINED MAN WITH A DASH OF PRIDE IN HIS
NATURE MORE LIKELY TO HIDE HIS WOUNDS THAN TO EXPOSE THEM THEN
SUDDENLY WITH A FIERCE GESTURE OF HIS CLOSED HAND LIKE ONE WHO
THROWS RESERVE TO THE WINDS HE BEGAN
THE FACTS ARE THESE MR HOLMES SAID HE I AM A MARRIED MAN AND
HAVE BEEN SO FOR THREE YEARS DURING THAT TIME MY WIFE AND I HAVE
LOVED EACH OTHER AS FONDLY AND LIVED AS HAPPILY AS ANY TWO THAT EVER
WERE JOINED WE HAVE NOT HAD A DIFFERENCE NOT ONE IN THOUGHT OR
WORD OR DEED AND NOW SINCE LAST MONDAY THERE HAS SUDDENLY SPRUNG
UP A BARRIER BETWEEN US AND I FIND THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN HER
LIFE AND IN HER THOUGHT OF WHICH I KNOW AS LITTLE AS IF SHE WERE THE
WOMAN WHO BRUSHES BY ME IN THE STREET WE ARE ESTRANGED AND I WANT
TO KNOW WHY
NOW THERE IS ONE THING THAT I WANT TO IMPRESS UPON YOU BEFORE I GO
ANY FURTHER MR HOLMES EFFIE LOVES ME DONT LET THERE BE ANY
MISTAKE ABOUT THAT SHE LOVES ME WITH HER WHOLE HEART AND SOUL AND
NEVER MORE THAN NOW I KNOW IT I FEEL IT I DONT WANT TO ARGUE
ABOUT THAT A MAN CAN TELL EASILY ENOUGH WHEN A WOMAN LOVES HIM BUT
THERES THIS SECRET BETWEEN US AND WE CAN NEVER BE THE SAME UNTIL IT
IS CLEARED
KINDLY LET ME HAVE THE FACTS MR MUNRO SAID HOLMES WITH SOME
IMPATIENCE
ILL TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW ABOUT EFFIES HISTORY SHE WAS A WIDOW
WHEN I MET HER FIRST THOUGH QUITE YOUNGONLY TWENTYFIVE HER NAME
THEN WAS MRS HEBRON SHE WENT OUT TO AMERICA WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG AND
LIVED IN THE TOWN OF ATLANTA WHERE SHE MARRIED THIS HEBRON WHO WAS
A LAWYER WITH A GOOD PRACTICE THEY HAD ONE CHILD BUT THE YELLOW
FEVER BROKE OUT BADLY IN THE PLACE AND BOTH HUSBAND AND CHILD DIED
OF IT I HAVE SEEN HIS DEATH CERTIFICATE THIS SICKENED HER OF
AMERICA AND SHE CAME BACK TO LIVE WITH A MAIDEN AUNT AT PINNER IN
MIDDLESEX I MAY MENTION THAT HER HUSBAND HAD LEFT HER COMFORTABLY
OFF AND THAT SHE HAD A CAPITAL OF ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED
POUNDS WHICH HAD BEEN SO WELL INVESTED BY HIM THAT IT RETURNED AN
AVERAGE OF SEVEN PER CENT SHE HAD ONLY BEEN SIX MONTHS AT PINNER
WHEN I MET HER WE FELL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER AND WE MARRIED A FEW
WEEKS AFTERWARDS
I AM A HOP MERCHANT MYSELF AND AS I HAVE AN INCOME OF SEVEN OR
EIGHT HUNDRED WE FOUND OURSELVES COMFORTABLY OFF AND TOOK A NICE
EIGHTYPOUNDAYEAR VILLA AT NORBURY OUR LITTLE PLACE WAS VERY
COUNTRIFIED CONSIDERING THAT IT IS SO CLOSE TO TOWN WE HAD AN INN
AND TWO HOUSES A LITTLE ABOVE US AND A SINGLE COTTAGE AT THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE FIELD WHICH FACES US AND EXCEPT THOSE THERE WERE NO
HOUSES UNTIL YOU GOT HALF WAY TO THE STATION MY BUSINESS TOOK ME
INTO TOWN AT CERTAIN SEASONS BUT IN SUMMER I HAD LESS TO DO AND
THEN IN OUR COUNTRY HOME MY WIFE AND I WERE JUST AS HAPPY AS COULD BE
WISHED I TELL YOU THAT THERE NEVER WAS A SHADOW BETWEEN US UNTIL
THIS ACCURSED AFFAIR BEGAN
THERES ONE THING I OUGHT TO TELL YOU BEFORE I GO FURTHER WHEN WE
MARRIED MY WIFE MADE OVER ALL HER PROPERTY TO MERATHER AGAINST MY
WILL FOR I SAW HOW AWKWARD IT WOULD BE IF MY BUSINESS AFFAIRS WENT
WRONG HOWEVER SHE WOULD HAVE IT SO AND IT WAS DONE WELL ABOUT
SIX WEEKS AGO SHE CAME TO ME
JACK SAID SHE WHEN YOU TOOK MY MONEY YOU SAID THAT IF EVER I
WANTED ANY I WAS TO ASK YOU FOR IT
CERTAINLY SAID I ITS ALL YOUR OWN
WELL SAID SHE I WANT A HUNDRED POUNDS
I WAS A BIT STAGGERED AT THIS FOR I HAD IMAGINED IT WAS SIMPLY A
NEW DRESS OR SOMETHING OF THE KIND THAT SHE WAS AFTER
WHAT ON EARTH FOR I ASKED
OH SAID SHE IN HER PLAYFUL WAY YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE ONLY MY
BANKER AND BANKERS NEVER ASK QUESTIONS YOU KNOW
IF YOU REALLY MEAN IT OF COURSE YOU SHALL HAVE THE MONEY SAID I
OH YES I REALLY MEAN IT
AND YOU WONT TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT IT FOR
SOME DAY PERHAPS BUT NOT JUST AT PRESENT JACK
SO I HAD TO BE CONTENT WITH THAT THOUGH IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT
THERE HAD EVER BEEN ANY SECRET BETWEEN US I GAVE HER A CHECK AND I
NEVER THOUGHT ANY MORE OF THE MATTER IT MAY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
WHAT CAME AFTERWARDS BUT I THOUGHT IT ONLY RIGHT TO MENTION IT
WELL I TOLD YOU JUST NOW THAT THERE IS A COTTAGE NOT FAR FROM OUR
HOUSE THERE IS JUST A FIELD BETWEEN US BUT TO REACH IT YOU HAVE TO
GO ALONG THE ROAD AND THEN TURN DOWN A LANE JUST BEYOND IT IS A NICE
LITTLE GROVE OF SCOTCH FIRS AND I USED TO BE VERY FOND OF STROLLING
DOWN THERE FOR TREES ARE ALWAYS A NEIGHBORLY KIND OF THINGS THE
COTTAGE HAD BEEN STANDING EMPTY THIS EIGHT MONTHS AND IT WAS A PITY
FOR IT WAS A PRETTY TWO STORIED PLACE WITH AN OLDFASHIONED PORCH
AND HONEYSUCKLE ABOUT IT I HAVE STOOD MANY A TIME AND THOUGHT WHAT A
NEAT LITTLE HOMESTEAD IT WOULD MAKE
WELL LAST MONDAY EVENING I WAS TAKING A STROLL DOWN THAT WAY WHEN
I MET AN EMPTY VAN COMING UP THE LANE AND SAW A PILE OF CARPETS AND
THINGS LYING ABOUT ON THE GRASSPLOT BESIDE THE PORCH IT WAS CLEAR
THAT THE COTTAGE HAD AT LAST BEEN LET I WALKED PAST IT AND WONDERED
WHAT SORT OF FOLK THEY WERE WHO HAD COME TO LIVE SO NEAR US AND AS I
LOOKED I SUDDENLY BECAME AWARE THAT A FACE WAS WATCHING ME OUT OF ONE
OF THE UPPER WINDOWS
I DONT KNOW WHAT THERE WAS ABOUT THAT FACE MR HOLMES BUT IT
SEEMED TO SEND A CHILL RIGHT DOWN MY BACK I WAS SOME LITTLE WAY OFF
SO THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE FEATURES BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING
UNNATURAL AND INHUMAN ABOUT THE FACE THAT WAS THE IMPRESSION THAT I
HAD AND I MOVED QUICKLY FORWARDS TO GET A NEARER VIEW OF THE PERSON
WHO WAS WATCHING ME BUT AS I DID SO THE FACE SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
SO SUDDENLY THAT IT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN PLUCKED AWAY INTO THE
DARKNESS OF THE ROOM I STOOD FOR FIVE MINUTES THINKING THE BUSINESS
OVER AND TRYING TO ANALYZE MY IMPRESSIONS I COULD NOT TELL IF THE
FACE WERE THAT OF A MAN OR A WOMAN IT HAD BEEN TOO FAR FROM ME FOR
THAT BUT ITS COLOR WAS WHAT HAD IMPRESSED ME MOST IT WAS OF A LIVID
CHALKY WHITE AND WITH SOMETHING SET AND RIGID ABOUT IT WHICH WAS
SHOCKINGLY UNNATURAL SO DISTURBED WAS I THAT I DETERMINED TO SEE A
LITTLE MORE OF THE NEW INMATES OF THE COTTAGE I APPROACHED AND
KNOCKED AT THE DOOR WHICH WAS INSTANTLY OPENED BY A TALL GAUNT
WOMAN WITH A HARSH FORBIDDING FACE
WHAT MAY YOU BE WANTIN SHE ASKED IN A NORTHERN ACCENT
I AM YOUR NEIGHBOR OVER YONDER SAID I NODDING TOWARDS MY HOUSE
I SEE THAT YOU HAVE ONLY JUST MOVED IN SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD
BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU IN ANY
AY WELL JUST ASK YE WHEN WE WANT YE SAID SHE AND SHUT THE DOOR
IN MY FACE ANNOYED AT THE CHURLISH REBUFF I TURNED MY BACK AND
WALKED HOME ALL EVENING THOUGH I TRIED TO THINK OF OTHER THINGS MY
MIND WOULD STILL TURN TO THE APPARITION AT THE WINDOW AND THE
RUDENESS OF THE WOMAN I DETERMINED TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE FORMER
TO MY WIFE FOR SHE IS A NERVOUS HIGHLY STRUNG WOMAN AND I HAD NO
WISH THAT SHE WOULD SHARE THE UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION WHICH HAD BEEN
PRODUCED UPON MYSELF I REMARKED TO HER HOWEVER BEFORE I FELL
ASLEEP THAT THE COTTAGE WAS NOW OCCUPIED TO WHICH SHE RETURNED NO
REPLY
I AM USUALLY AN EXTREMELY SOUND SLEEPER IT HAS BEEN A STANDING JEST
IN THE FAMILY THAT NOTHING COULD EVER WAKE ME DURING THE NIGHT AND
YET SOMEHOW ON THAT PARTICULAR NIGHT WHETHER IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE
SLIGHT EXCITEMENT PRODUCED BY MY LITTLE ADVENTURE OR NOT I KNOW NOT
BUT I SLEPT MUCH MORE LIGHTLY THAN USUAL HALF IN MY DREAMS I WAS
DIMLY CONSCIOUS THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON IN THE ROOM AND
GRADUALLY BECAME AWARE THAT MY WIFE HAD DRESSED HERSELF AND WAS
SLIPPING ON HER MANTLE AND HER BONNET MY LIPS WERE PARTED TO MURMUR
OUT SOME SLEEPY WORDS OF SURPRISE OR REMONSTRANCE AT THIS UNTIMELY
PREPARATION WHEN SUDDENLY MY HALFOPENED EYES FELL UPON HER FACE
ILLUMINATED BY THE CANDLELIGHT AND ASTONISHMENT HELD ME DUMB SHE
WORE AN EXPRESSION SUCH AS I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORESUCH AS I SHOULD
HAVE THOUGHT HER INCAPABLE OF ASSUMING SHE WAS DEADLY PALE AND
BREATHING FAST GLANCING FURTIVELY TOWARDS THE BED AS SHE FASTENED
HER MANTLE TO SEE IF SHE HAD DISTURBED ME THEN THINKING THAT I WAS
STILL ASLEEP SHE SLIPPED NOISELESSLY FROM THE ROOM AND AN INSTANT
LATER I HEARD A SHARP CREAKING WHICH COULD ONLY COME FROM THE HINGES
OF THE FRONT DOOR I SAT UP IN BED AND RAPPED MY KNUCKLES AGAINST THE
RAIL TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT I WAS TRULY AWAKE THEN I TOOK MY WATCH
FROM UNDER THE PILLOW IT WAS THREE IN THE MORNING WHAT ON THIS
EARTH COULD MY WIFE BE DOING OUT ON THE COUNTRY ROAD AT THREE IN THE
MORNING
I HAD SAT FOR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES TURNING THE THING OVER IN MY MIND
AND TRYING TO FIND SOME POSSIBLE EXPLANATION THE MORE I THOUGHT THE
MORE EXTRAORDINARY AND INEXPLICABLE DID IT APPEAR I WAS STILL
PUZZLING OVER IT WHEN I HEARD THE DOOR GENTLY CLOSE AGAIN AND HER
FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE STAIRS
WHERE IN THE WORLD HAVE YOU BEEN EFFIE I ASKED AS SHE ENTERED
SHE GAVE A VIOLENT START AND A KIND OF GASPING CRY WHEN I SPOKE AND
THAT CRY AND START TROUBLED ME MORE THAN ALL THE REST FOR THERE WAS
SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY GUILTY ABOUT THEM MY WIFE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A
WOMAN OF A FRANK OPEN NATURE AND IT GAVE ME A CHILL TO SEE HER
SLINKING INTO HER OWN ROOM AND CRYING OUT AND WINCING WHEN HER OWN
HUSBAND SPOKE TO HER
YOU AWAKE JACK SHE CRIED WITH A NERVOUS LAUGH WHY I THOUGHT
THAT NOTHING COULD AWAKE YOU
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN I ASKED MORE STERNLY
I DONT WONDER THAT YOU ARE SURPRISED SAID SHE AND I COULD SEE
THAT HER FINGERS WERE TREMBLING AS SHE UNDID THE FASTENINGS OF HER
MANTLE WHY I NEVER REMEMBER HAVING DONE SUCH A THING IN MY LIFE
BEFORE THE FACT IS THAT I FELT AS THOUGH I WERE CHOKING AND HAD A
PERFECT LONGING FOR A BREATH OF FRESH AIR I REALLY THINK THAT I
SHOULD HAVE FAINTED IF I HAD NOT GONE OUT I STOOD AT THE DOOR FOR A
FEW MINUTES AND NOW I AM QUITE MYSELF AGAIN
ALL THE TIME THAT SHE WAS TELLING ME THIS STORY SHE NEVER ONCE
LOOKED IN MY DIRECTION AND HER VOICE WAS QUITE UNLIKE HER USUAL
TONES IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT SHE WAS SAYING WHAT WAS FALSE I
SAID NOTHING IN REPLY BUT TURNED MY FACE TO THE WALL SICK AT HEART
WITH MY MIND FILLED WITH A THOUSAND VENOMOUS DOUBTS AND SUSPICIONS
WHAT WAS IT THAT MY WIFE WAS CONCEALING FROM ME WHERE HAD SHE BEEN
DURING THAT STRANGE EXPEDITION I FELT THAT I SHOULD HAVE NO PEACE
UNTIL I KNEW AND YET I SHRANK FROM ASKING HER AGAIN AFTER ONCE SHE
HAD TOLD ME WHAT WAS FALSE ALL THE REST OF THE NIGHT I TOSSED AND
TUMBLED FRAMING THEORY AFTER THEORY EACH MORE UNLIKELY THAN THE
LAST
I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THE CITY THAT DAY BUT I WAS TOO DISTURBED IN
MY MIND TO BE ABLE TO PAY ATTENTION TO BUSINESS MATTERS MY WIFE
SEEMED TO BE AS UPSET AS MYSELF AND I COULD SEE FROM THE LITTLE
QUESTIONING GLANCES WHICH SHE KEPT SHOOTING AT ME THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD
THAT I DISBELIEVED HER STATEMENT AND THAT SHE WAS AT HER WITS END
WHAT TO DO WE HARDLY EXCHANGED A WORD DURING BREAKFAST AND
IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS I WENT OUT FOR A WALK THAT I MIGHT THINK THE
MATTER OUT IN THE FRESH MORNING AIR
I WENT AS FAR AS THE CRYSTAL PALACE SPENT AN HOUR IN THE GROUNDS
AND WAS BACK IN NORBURY BY ONE OCLOCK IT HAPPENED THAT MY WAY TOOK
ME PAST THE COTTAGE AND I STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT TO LOOK AT THE
WINDOWS AND TO SEE IF I COULD CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE STRANGE FACE
WHICH HAD LOOKED OUT AT ME ON THE DAY BEFORE AS I STOOD THERE
IMAGINE MY SURPRISE MR HOLMES WHEN THE DOOR SUDDENLY OPENED AND MY
WIFE WALKED OUT
I WAS STRUCK DUMB WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THE SIGHT OF HER BUT MY
EMOTIONS WERE NOTHING TO THOSE WHICH SHOWED THEMSELVES UPON HER FACE
WHEN OUR EYES MET SHE SEEMED FOR AN INSTANT TO WISH TO SHRINK BACK
INSIDE THE HOUSE AGAIN AND THEN SEEING HOW USELESS ALL CONCEALMENT
MUST BE SHE CAME FORWARD WITH A VERY WHITE FACE AND FRIGHTENED EYES
WHICH BELIED THE SMILE UPON HER LIPS
AH JACK SHE SAID I HAVE JUST BEEN IN TO SEE IF I CAN BE OF ANY
ASSISTANCE TO OUR NEW NEIGHBORS WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT
JACK YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME
SO SAID I THIS IS WHERE YOU WENT DURING THE NIGHT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE CRIED
YOU CAME HERE I AM SURE OF IT WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE THAT YOU
SHOULD VISIT THEM AT SUCH AN HOUR
I HAVE NOT BEEN HERE BEFORE
HOW CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW IS FALSE I CRIED YOUR VERY
VOICE CHANGES AS YOU SPEAK WHEN HAVE I EVER HAD A SECRET FROM YOU I
SHALL ENTER THAT COTTAGE AND I SHALL PROBE THE MATTER TO THE
BOTTOM
NO NO JACK FOR GODS SAKE SHE GASPED IN UNCONTROLLABLE
EMOTION THEN AS I APPROACHED THE DOOR SHE SEIZED MY SLEEVE AND
PULLED ME BACK WITH CONVULSIVE STRENGTH
I IMPLORE YOU NOT TO DO THIS JACK SHE CRIED I SWEAR THAT I
WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING SOME DAY BUT NOTHING BUT MISERY CAN COME OF
IT IF YOU ENTER THAT COTTAGE THEN AS I TRIED TO SHAKE HER OFF SHE
CLUNG TO ME IN A FRENZY OF ENTREATY
TRUST ME JACK SHE CRIED TRUST ME ONLY THIS ONCE YOU WILL
NEVER HAVE CAUSE TO REGRET IT YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE A
SECRET FROM YOU IF IT WERE NOT FOR YOUR OWN SAKE OUR WHOLE LIVES ARE
AT STAKE IN THIS IF YOU COME HOME WITH ME ALL WILL BE WELL IF YOU
FORCE YOUR WAY INTO THAT COTTAGE ALL IS OVER BETWEEN US
THERE WAS SUCH EARNESTNESS SUCH DESPAIR IN HER MANNER THAT HER
WORDS ARRESTED ME AND I STOOD IRRESOLUTE BEFORE THE DOOR
I WILL TRUST YOU ON ONE CONDITION AND ON ONE CONDITION ONLY SAID
I AT LAST IT IS THAT THIS MYSTERY COMES TO AN END FROM NOW YOU ARE
AT LIBERTY TO PRESERVE YOUR SECRET BUT YOU MUST PROMISE ME THAT
THERE SHALL BE NO MORE NIGHTLY VISITS NO MORE DOINGS WHICH ARE KEPT
FROM MY KNOWLEDGE I AM WILLING TO FORGET THOSE WHICH ARE PASSED IF
YOU WILL PROMISE THAT THERE SHALL BE NO MORE IN THE FUTURE
I WAS SURE THAT YOU WOULD TRUST ME SHE CRIED WITH A GREAT SIGH
OF RELIEF IT SHALL BE JUST AS YOU WISH COME AWAYOH COME AWAY UP
TO THE HOUSE
STILL PULLING AT MY SLEEVE SHE LED ME AWAY FROM THE COTTAGE AS WE
WENT I GLANCED BACK AND THERE WAS THAT YELLOW LIVID FACE WATCHING US
OUT OF THE UPPER WINDOW WHAT LINK COULD THERE BE BETWEEN THAT
CREATURE AND MY WIFE OR HOW COULD THE COARSE ROUGH WOMAN WHOM I HAD
SEEN THE DAY BEFORE BE CONNECTED WITH HER IT WAS A STRANGE PUZZLE
AND YET I KNEW THAT MY MIND COULD NEVER KNOW EASE AGAIN UNTIL I HAD
SOLVED IT
FOR TWO DAYS AFTER THIS I STAYED AT HOME AND MY WIFE APPEARED TO
ABIDE LOYALLY BY OUR ENGAGEMENT FOR AS FAR AS I KNOW SHE NEVER
STIRRED OUT OF THE HOUSE ON THE THIRD DAY HOWEVER I HAD AMPLE
EVIDENCE THAT HER SOLEMN PROMISE WAS NOT ENOUGH TO HOLD HER BACK FROM
THIS SECRET INFLUENCE WHICH DREW HER AWAY FROM HER HUSBAND AND HER
DUTY
I HAD GONE INTO TOWN ON THAT DAY BUT I RETURNED BY THE INSTEAD
OF THE WHICH IS MY USUAL TRAIN AS I ENTERED THE HOUSE THE MAID
RAN INTO THE HALL WITH A STARTLED FACE
WHERE IS YOUR MISTRESS I ASKED
I THINK THAT SHE HAS GONE OUT FOR A WALK SHE ANSWERED
MY MIND WAS INSTANTLY FILLED WITH SUSPICION I RUSHED UPSTAIRS TO
MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS NOT IN THE HOUSE AS I DID SO I HAPPENED TO
GLANCE OUT OF ONE OF THE UPPER WINDOWS AND SAW THE MAID WITH WHOM I
HAD JUST BEEN SPEAKING RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD IN THE DIRECTION OF
THE COTTAGE THEN OF COURSE I SAW EXACTLY WHAT IT ALL MEANT MY WIFE
HAD GONE OVER THERE AND HAD ASKED THE SERVANT TO CALL HER IF I
SHOULD RETURN TINGLING WITH ANGER I RUSHED DOWN AND HURRIED ACROSS
DETERMINED TO END THE MATTER ONCE AND FOREVER I SAW MY WIFE AND THE
MAID HURRYING BACK ALONG THE LANE BUT I DID NOT STOP TO SPEAK WITH
THEM IN THE COTTAGE LAY THE SECRET WHICH WAS CASTING A SHADOW OVER
MY LIFE I VOWED THAT COME WHAT MIGHT IT SHOULD BE A SECRET NO
LONGER I DID NOT EVEN KNOCK WHEN I REACHED IT BUT TURNED THE HANDLE
AND RUSHED INTO THE PASSAGE
IT WAS ALL STILL AND QUIET UPON THE GROUND FLOOR IN THE KITCHEN A
KETTLE WAS SINGING ON THE FIRE AND A LARGE BLACK CAT LAY COILED UP
IN THE BASKET BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE WOMAN WHOM I HAD SEEN
BEFORE I RAN INTO THE OTHER ROOM BUT IT WAS EQUALLY DESERTED THEN
I RUSHED UP THE STAIRS ONLY TO FIND TWO OTHER ROOMS EMPTY AND
DESERTED AT THE TOP THERE WAS NO ONE AT ALL IN THE WHOLE HOUSE THE
FURNITURE AND PICTURES WERE OF THE MOST COMMON AND VULGAR
DESCRIPTION SAVE IN THE ONE CHAMBER AT THE WINDOW OF WHICH I HAD
SEEN THE STRANGE FACE THAT WAS COMFORTABLE AND ELEGANT AND ALL MY
SUSPICIONS ROSE INTO A FIERCE BITTER FLAME WHEN I SAW THAT ON THE
MANTELPIECE STOOD A COPY OF A FULLLENGTH PHOTOGRAPH OF MY WIFE
WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN AT MY REQUEST ONLY THREE MONTHS AGO
I STAYED LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE HOUSE WAS ABSOLUTELY
EMPTY THEN I LEFT IT FEELING A WEIGHT AT MY HEART SUCH AS I HAD
NEVER HAD BEFORE MY WIFE CAME OUT INTO THE HALL AS I ENTERED MY
HOUSE BUT I WAS TOO HURT AND ANGRY TO SPEAK WITH HER AND PUSHING
PAST HER I MADE MY WAY INTO MY STUDY SHE FOLLOWED ME HOWEVER
BEFORE I COULD CLOSE THE DOOR
I AM SORRY THAT I BROKE MY PROMISE JACK SAID SHE BUT IF YOU
KNEW ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES I AM SURE THAT YOU WOULD FORGIVE ME
TELL ME EVERYTHING THEN SAID I
I CANNOT JACK I CANNOT SHE CRIED
UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHO IT IS THAT HAS BEEN LIVING IN THAT COTTAGE
AND WHO IT IS TO WHOM YOU HAVE GIVEN THAT PHOTOGRAPH THERE CAN NEVER
BE ANY CONFIDENCE BETWEEN US SAID I AND BREAKING AWAY FROM HER I
LEFT THE HOUSE THAT WAS YESTERDAY MR HOLMES AND I HAVE NOT SEEN
HER SINCE NOR DO I KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THIS STRANGE BUSINESS
IT IS THE FIRST SHADOW THAT HAS COME BETWEEN US AND IT HAS SO SHAKEN
ME THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO FOR THE BEST SUDDENLY THIS
MORNING IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT YOU WERE THE MAN TO ADVISE ME SO I
HAVE HURRIED TO YOU NOW AND I PLACE MYSELF UNRESERVEDLY IN YOUR
HANDS IF THERE IS ANY POINT WHICH I HAVE NOT MADE CLEAR PRAY
QUESTION ME ABOUT IT BUT ABOVE ALL TELL ME QUICKLY WHAT I AM TO
DO FOR THIS MISERY IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR
HOLMES AND I HAD LISTENED WITH THE UTMOST INTEREST TO THIS
EXTRAORDINARY STATEMENT WHICH HAD BEEN DELIVERED IN THE JERKY
BROKEN FASHION OF A MAN WHO IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXTREME
EMOTIONS MY COMPANION SAT SILENT FOR SOME TIME WITH HIS CHIN UPON
HIS HAND LOST IN THOUGHT
TELL ME SAID HE AT LAST COULD YOU SWEAR THAT THIS WAS A MANS
FACE WHICH YOU SAW AT THE WINDOW
EACH TIME THAT I SAW IT I WAS SOME DISTANCE AWAY FROM IT SO THAT IT
IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY
YOU APPEAR HOWEVER TO HAVE BEEN DISAGREEABLY IMPRESSED BY IT
IT SEEMED TO BE OF AN UNNATURAL COLOR AND TO HAVE A STRANGE
RIGIDITY ABOUT THE FEATURES WHEN I APPROACHED IT VANISHED WITH A
JERK
HOW LONG IS IT SINCE YOUR WIFE ASKED YOU FOR A HUNDRED POUNDS
NEARLY TWO MONTHS
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A PHOTOGRAPH OF HER FIRST HUSBAND
NO THERE WAS A GREAT FIRE AT ATLANTA VERY SHORTLY AFTER HIS DEATH
AND ALL HER PAPERS WERE DESTROYED
AND YET SHE HAD A CERTIFICATE OF DEATH YOU SAY THAT YOU SAW IT
YES SHE GOT A DUPLICATE AFTER THE FIRE
DID YOU EVER MEET ANY ONE WHO KNEW HER IN AMERICA
NO
DID SHE EVER TALK OF REVISITING THE PLACE
NO
OR GET LETTERS FROM IT
NO
THANK YOU I SHOULD LIKE TO THINK OVER THE MATTER A LITTLE NOW IF
THE COTTAGE IS NOW PERMANENTLY DESERTED WE MAY HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY
IF ON THE OTHER HAND AS I FANCY IS MORE LIKELY THE INMATES WERE
WARNED OF YOUR COMING AND LEFT BEFORE YOU ENTERED YESTERDAY THEN
THEY MAY BE BACK NOW AND WE SHOULD CLEAR IT ALL UP EASILY LET ME
ADVISE YOU THEN TO RETURN TO NORBURY AND TO EXAMINE THE WINDOWS OF
THE COTTAGE AGAIN IF YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IS INHABITED
DO NOT FORCE YOUR WAY IN BUT SEND A WIRE TO MY FRIEND AND ME WE
SHALL BE WITH YOU WITHIN AN HOUR OF RECEIVING IT AND WE SHALL THEN
VERY SOON GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BUSINESS
AND IF IT IS STILL EMPTY
IN THAT CASE I SHALL COME OUT TOMORROW AND TALK IT OVER WITH YOU
GOODBYE AND ABOVE ALL DO NOT FRET UNTIL YOU KNOW THAT YOU REALLY
HAVE A CAUSE FOR IT
I AM AFRAID THAT THIS IS A BAD BUSINESS WATSON SAID MY COMPANION
AS HE RETURNED AFTER ACCOMPANYING MR GRANT MUNRO TO THE DOOR WHAT
DO YOU MAKE OF IT
IT HAD AN UGLY SOUND I ANSWERED
YES THERES BLACKMAIL IN IT OR I AM MUCH MISTAKEN
AND WHO IS THE BLACKMAILER
WELL IT MUST BE THE CREATURE WHO LIVES IN THE ONLY COMFORTABLE ROOM
IN THE PLACE AND HAS HER PHOTOGRAPH ABOVE HIS FIREPLACE UPON MY
WORD WATSON THERE IS SOMETHING VERY ATTRACTIVE ABOUT THAT LIVID
FACE AT THE WINDOW AND I WOULD NOT HAVE MISSED THE CASE FOR WORLDS
YOU HAVE A THEORY
YES A PROVISIONAL ONE BUT I SHALL BE SURPRISED IF IT DOES NOT TURN
OUT TO BE CORRECT THIS WOMANS FIRST HUSBAND IS IN THAT COTTAGE
WHY DO YOU THINK SO
HOW ELSE CAN WE EXPLAIN HER FRENZIED ANXIETY THAT HER SECOND ONE
SHOULD NOT ENTER IT THE FACTS AS I READ THEM ARE SOMETHING LIKE
THIS THIS WOMAN WAS MARRIED IN AMERICA HER HUSBAND DEVELOPED SOME
HATEFUL QUALITIES OR SHALL WE SAY THAT HE CONTRACTED SOME LOATHSOME
DISEASE AND BECAME A LEPER OR AN IMBECILE SHE FLIES FROM HIM AT
LAST RETURNS TO ENGLAND CHANGES HER NAME AND STARTS HER LIFE AS
SHE THINKS AFRESH SHE HAS BEEN MARRIED THREE YEARS AND BELIEVES
THAT HER POSITION IS QUITE SECURE HAVING SHOWN HER HUSBAND THE DEATH
CERTIFICATE OF SOME MAN WHOSE NAME SHE HAS ASSUMED WHEN SUDDENLY HER
WHEREABOUTS IS DISCOVERED BY HER FIRST HUSBAND OR WE MAY SUPPOSE
BY SOME UNSCRUPULOUS WOMAN WHO HAS ATTACHED HERSELF TO THE INVALID
THEY WRITE TO THE WIFE AND THREATEN TO COME AND EXPOSE HER SHE ASKS
FOR A HUNDRED POUNDS AND ENDEAVORS TO BUY THEM OFF THEY COME IN
SPITE OF IT AND WHEN THE HUSBAND MENTIONS CASUALLY TO THE WIFE THAT
THERE ARE NEWCOMERS IN THE COTTAGE SHE KNOWS IN SOME WAY THAT THEY
ARE HER PURSUERS SHE WAITS UNTIL HER HUSBAND IS ASLEEP AND THEN SHE
RUSHES DOWN TO ENDEAVOR TO PERSUADE THEM TO LEAVE HER IN PEACE
HAVING NO SUCCESS SHE GOES AGAIN NEXT MORNING AND HER HUSBAND MEETS
HER AS HE HAS TOLD US AS SHE COMES OUT SHE PROMISES HIM THEN NOT
TO GO THERE AGAIN BUT TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS THE HOPE OF GETTING RID OF
THOSE DREADFUL NEIGHBORS WAS TOO STRONG FOR HER AND SHE MADE ANOTHER
ATTEMPT TAKING DOWN WITH HER THE PHOTOGRAPH WHICH HAD PROBABLY BEEN
DEMANDED FROM HER IN THE MIDST OF THIS INTERVIEW THE MAID RUSHED IN
TO SAY THAT THE MASTER HAD COME HOME ON WHICH THE WIFE KNOWING THAT
HE WOULD COME STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE COTTAGE HURRIED THE INMATES OUT
AT THE BACK DOOR INTO THE GROVE OF FIRTREES PROBABLY WHICH WAS
MENTIONED AS STANDING NEAR IN THIS WAY HE FOUND THE PLACE DESERTED
I SHALL BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED HOWEVER IF IT STILL SO WHEN HE
RECONNOITRES IT THIS EVENING WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY THEORY
IT IS ALL SURMISE
BUT AT LEAST IT COVERS ALL THE FACTS WHEN NEW FACTS COME TO OUR
KNOWLEDGE WHICH CANNOT BE COVERED BY IT IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO
RECONSIDER IT WE CAN DO NOTHING MORE UNTIL WE HAVE A MESSAGE FROM
OUR FRIEND AT NORBURY
BUT WE HAD NOT A VERY LONG TIME TO WAIT FOR THAT IT CAME JUST AS WE
HAD FINISHED OUR TEA
THE COTTAGE IS STILL TENANTED IT SAID HAVE SEEN THE FACE AGAIN
AT THE WINDOW WILL MEET THE SEVEN OCLOCK TRAIN AND WILL TAKE NO
STEPS UNTIL YOU ARRIVE
HE WAS WAITING ON THE PLATFORM WHEN WE STEPPED OUT AND WE COULD SEE
IN THE LIGHT OF THE STATION LAMPS THAT HE WAS VERY PALE AND
QUIVERING WITH AGITATION
THEY ARE STILL THERE MR HOLMES SAID HE LAYING HIS HAND HARD
UPON MY FRIENDS SLEEVE I SAW LIGHTS IN THE COTTAGE AS I CAME DOWN
WE SHALL SETTLE IT NOW ONCE AND FOR ALL
WHAT IS YOUR PLAN THEN ASKED HOLMES AS HE WALKED DOWN THE DARK
TREELINED ROAD
I AM GOING TO FORCE MY WAY IN AND SEE FOR MYSELF WHO IS IN THE
HOUSE I WISH YOU BOTH TO BE THERE AS WITNESSES
YOU ARE QUITE DETERMINED TO DO THIS IN SPITE OF YOUR WIFES WARNING
THAT IT IS BETTER THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SOLVE THE MYSTERY
YES I AM DETERMINED
WELL I THINK THAT YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT ANY TRUTH IS BETTER THAN
INDEFINITE DOUBT WE HAD BETTER GO UP AT ONCE OF COURSE LEGALLY WE
ARE PUTTING OURSELVES HOPELESSLY IN THE WRONG BUT I THINK THAT IT IS
WORTH IT
IT WAS A VERY DARK NIGHT AND A THIN RAIN BEGAN TO FALL AS WE TURNED
FROM THE HIGH ROAD INTO A NARROW LANE DEEPLY RUTTED WITH HEDGES ON
EITHER SIDE MR GRANT MUNRO PUSHED IMPATIENTLY FORWARD HOWEVER AND
WE STUMBLED AFTER HIM AS BEST WE COULD
THERE ARE THE LIGHTS OF MY HOUSE HE MURMURED POINTING TO A
GLIMMER AMONG THE TREES AND HERE IS THE COTTAGE WHICH I AM GOING TO
ENTER
WE TURNED A CORNER IN THE LANE AS HE SPOKE AND THERE WAS THE
BUILDING CLOSE BESIDE US A YELLOW BAR FALLING ACROSS THE BLACK
FOREGROUND SHOWED THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT QUITE CLOSED AND ONE WINDOW
IN THE UPPER STORY WAS BRIGHTLY ILLUMINATED AS WE LOOKED WE SAW A
DARK BLUR MOVING ACROSS THE BLIND
THERE IS THAT CREATURE CRIED GRANT MUNRO YOU CAN SEE FOR
YOURSELVES THAT SOME ONE IS THERE NOW FOLLOW ME AND WE SHALL SOON
KNOW ALL
WE APPROACHED THE DOOR BUT SUDDENLY A WOMAN APPEARED OUT OF THE
SHADOW AND STOOD IN THE GOLDEN TRACK OF THE LAMPLIGHT I COULD NOT
SEE HER FACE IN THE DARKNESS BUT HER ARMS WERE THROWN OUT IN AN
ATTITUDE OF ENTREATY
FOR GODS SAKE DONT JACK SHE CRIED I HAD A PRESENTIMENT THAT
YOU WOULD COME THIS EVENING THINK BETTER OF IT DEAR TRUST ME
AGAIN AND YOU WILL NEVER HAVE CAUSE TO REGRET IT
I HAVE TRUSTED YOU TOO LONG EFFIE HE CRIED STERNLY LEAVE GO OF
ME I MUST PASS YOU MY FRIENDS AND I ARE GOING TO SETTLE THIS MATTER
ONCE AND FOREVER HE PUSHED HER TO ONE SIDE AND WE FOLLOWED CLOSELY
AFTER HIM AS HE THREW THE DOOR OPEN AN OLD WOMAN RAN OUT IN FRONT OF
HIM AND TRIED TO BAR HIS PASSAGE BUT HE THRUST HER BACK AND AN
INSTANT AFTERWARDS WE WERE ALL UPON THE STAIRS GRANT MUNRO RUSHED
INTO THE LIGHTED ROOM AT THE TOP AND WE ENTERED AT HIS HEELS
IT WAS A COSY WELLFURNISHED APARTMENT WITH TWO CANDLES BURNING
UPON THE TABLE AND TWO UPON THE MANTELPIECE IN THE CORNER STOOPING
OVER A DESK THERE SAT WHAT APPEARED TO BE A LITTLE GIRL HER FACE
WAS TURNED AWAY AS WE ENTERED BUT WE COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS DRESSED
IN A RED FROCK AND THAT SHE HAD LONG WHITE GLOVES ON AS SHE WHISKED
ROUND TO US I GAVE A CRY OF SURPRISE AND HORROR THE FACE WHICH SHE
TURNED TOWARDS US WAS OF THE STRANGEST LIVID TINT AND THE FEATURES
WERE ABSOLUTELY DEVOID OF ANY EXPRESSION AN INSTANT LATER THE
MYSTERY WAS EXPLAINED HOLMES WITH A LAUGH PASSED HIS HAND BEHIND
THE CHILDS EAR A MASK PEELED OFF FROM HER COUNTENANCE AN THERE WAS
A LITTLE COAL BLACK NEGRESS WITH ALL HER WHITE TEETH FLASHING IN
AMUSEMENT AT OUR AMAZED FACES I BURST OUT LAUGHING OUT OF SYMPATHY
WITH HER MERRIMENT BUT GRANT MUNRO STOOD STARING WITH HIS HAND
CLUTCHING HIS THROAT
MY GOD HE CRIED WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING OF THIS
I WILL TELL YOU THE MEANING OF IT CRIED THE LADY SWEEPING INTO
THE ROOM WITH A PROUD SET FACE YOU HAVE FORCED ME AGAINST MY OWN
JUDGMENT TO TELL YOU AND NOW WE MUST BOTH MAKE THE BEST OF IT MY
HUSBAND DIED AT ATLANTA MY CHILD SURVIVED
YOUR CHILD
SHE DREW A LARGE SILVER LOCKET FROM HER BOSOM YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
THIS OPEN
I UNDERSTOOD THAT IT DID NOT OPEN
SHE TOUCHED A SPRING AND THE FRONT HINGED BACK THERE WAS A PORTRAIT
WITHIN OF A MAN STRIKINGLY HANDSOME AND INTELLIGENTLOOKING BUT
BEARING UNMISTAKABLE SIGNS UPON HIS FEATURES OF HIS AFRICAN DESCENT
THAT IS JOHN HEBRON OF ATLANTA SAID THE LADY AND A NOBLER MAN
NEVER WALKED THE EARTH I CUT MYSELF OFF FROM MY RACE IN ORDER TO WED
HIM BUT NEVER ONCE WHILE HE LIVED DID I FOR AN INSTANT REGRET IT IT
WAS OUR MISFORTUNE THAT OUR ONLY CHILD TOOK AFTER HIS PEOPLE RATHER
THAN MINE IT IS OFTEN SO IN SUCH MATCHES AND LITTLE LUCY IS DARKER
FAR THAN EVER HER FATHER WAS BUT DARK OR FAIR SHE IS MY OWN DEAR
LITTLE GIRLIE AND HER MOTHERS PET THE LITTLE CREATURE RAN ACROSS
AT THE WORDS AND NESTLED UP AGAINST THE LADYS DRESS WHEN I LEFT
HER IN AMERICA SHE CONTINUED IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE HER HEALTH WAS
WEAK AND THE CHANGE MIGHT HAVE DONE HER HARM SHE WAS GIVEN TO THE
CARE OF A FAITHFUL SCOTCH WOMAN WHO HAD ONCE BEEN OUR SERVANT NEVER
FOR AN INSTANT DID I DREAM OF DISOWNING HER AS MY CHILD BUT WHEN
CHANCE THREW YOU IN MY WAY JACK AND I LEARNED TO LOVE YOU I FEARED
TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY CHILD GOD FORGIVE ME I FEARED THAT I SHOULD
LOSE YOU AND I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO TELL YOU I HAD TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN YOU AND IN MY WEAKNESS I TURNED AWAY FROM MY OWN LITTLE
GIRL FOR THREE YEARS I HAVE KEPT HER EXISTENCE A SECRET FROM YOU
BUT I HEARD FROM THE NURSE AND I KNEW THAT ALL WAS WELL WITH HER AT
LAST HOWEVER THERE CAME AN OVERWHELMING DESIRE TO SEE THE CHILD
ONCE MORE I STRUGGLED AGAINST IT BUT IN VAIN THOUGH I KNEW THE
DANGER I DETERMINED TO HAVE THE CHILD OVER IF IT WERE BUT FOR A FEW
WEEKS I SENT A HUNDRED POUNDS TO THE NURSE AND I GAVE HER
INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT THIS COTTAGE SO THAT SHE MIGHT COME AS A
NEIGHBOR WITHOUT MY APPEARING TO BE IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH HER I
PUSHED MY PRECAUTIONS SO FAR AS TO ORDER HER TO KEEP THE CHILD IN THE
HOUSE DURING THE DAYTIME AND TO COVER UP HER LITTLE FACE AND HANDS
SO THAT EVEN THOSE WHO MIGHT SEE HER AT THE WINDOW SHOULD NOT GOSSIP
ABOUT THERE BEING A BLACK CHILD IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IF I HAD BEEN
LESS CAUTIOUS I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE WISE BUT I WAS HALF CRAZY WITH
FEAR THAT YOU SHOULD LEARN THE TRUTH
IT WAS YOU WHO TOLD ME FIRST THAT THE COTTAGE WAS OCCUPIED I SHOULD
HAVE WAITED FOR THE MORNING BUT I COULD NOT SLEEP FOR EXCITEMENT
AND SO AT LAST I SLIPPED OUT KNOWING HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO AWAKE
YOU BUT YOU SAW ME GO AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF MY TROUBLES
NEXT DAY YOU HAD MY SECRET AT YOUR MERCY BUT YOU NOBLY REFRAINED
FROM PURSUING YOUR ADVANTAGE THREE DAYS LATER HOWEVER THE NURSE
AND CHILD ONLY JUST ESCAPED FROM THE BACK DOOR AS YOU RUSHED IN AT
THE FRONT ONE AND NOW TONIGHT YOU AT LAST KNOW ALL AND I ASK YOU
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US MY CHILD AND ME SHE CLASPED HER HANDS AND
WAITED FOR AN ANSWER
IT WAS A LONG TEN MINUTES BEFORE GRANT MUNRO BROKE THE SILENCE AND
WHEN HIS ANSWER CAME IT WAS ONE OF WHICH I LOVE TO THINK HE LIFTED
THE LITTLE CHILD KISSED HER AND THEN STILL CARRYING HER HE HELD
HIS OTHER HAND OUT TO HIS WIFE AND TURNED TOWARDS THE DOOR
WE CAN TALK IT OVER MORE COMFORTABLY AT HOME SAID HE I AM NOT A
VERY GOOD MAN EFFIE BUT I THINK THAT I AM A BETTER ONE THAN YOU
HAVE GIVEN ME CREDIT FOR BEING
HOLMES AND I FOLLOWED THEM DOWN THE LANE AND MY FRIEND PLUCKED AT MY
SLEEVE AS WE CAME OUT
I THINK SAID HE THAT WE SHALL BE OF MORE USE IN LONDON THAN IN
NORBURY
NOT ANOTHER WORD DID HE SAY OF THE CASE UNTIL LATE THAT NIGHT WHEN
HE WAS TURNING AWAY WITH HIS LIGHTED CANDLE FOR HIS BEDROOM
WATSON SAID HE IF IT SHOULD EVER STRIKE YOU THAT I AM GETTING A
LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT IN MY POWERS OR GIVING LESS PAINS TO A CASE
THAN IT DESERVES KINDLY WHISPER NORBURY IN MY EAR AND I SHALL BE
INFINITELY OBLIGED TO YOU THE STOCKBROKERS CLERK
SHORTLY AFTER MY MARRIAGE I HAD BOUGHT A CONNECTION IN THE PADDINGTON
DISTRICT OLD MR FARQUHAR FROM WHOM I PURCHASED IT HAD AT ONE TIME
AN EXCELLENT GENERAL PRACTICE BUT HIS AGE AND AN AFFLICTION OF THE
NATURE OF ST VITUSS DANCE FROM WHICH HE SUFFERED HAD VERY MUCH
THINNED IT THE PUBLIC NOT UNNATURALLY GOES ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT HE
WHO WOULD HEAL OTHERS MUST HIMSELF BE WHOLE AND LOOKS ASKANCE AT THE
CURATIVE POWERS OF THE MAN WHOSE OWN CASE IS BEYOND THE REACH OF HIS
DRUGS THUS AS MY PREDECESSOR WEAKENED HIS PRACTICE DECLINED UNTIL
WHEN I PURCHASED IT FROM HIM IT HAD SUNK FROM TWELVE HUNDRED TO
LITTLE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED A YEAR I HAD CONFIDENCE HOWEVER IN
MY OWN YOUTH AND ENERGY AND WAS CONVINCED THAT IN A VERY FEW YEARS
THE CONCERN WOULD BE AS FLOURISHING AS EVER
FOR THREE MONTHS AFTER TAKING OVER THE PRACTICE I WAS KEPT VERY
CLOSELY AT WORK AND SAW LITTLE OF MY FRIEND SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR I
WAS TOO BUSY TO VISIT BAKER STREET AND HE SELDOM WENT ANYWHERE
HIMSELF SAVE UPON PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS I WAS SURPRISED THEREFORE
WHEN ONE MORNING IN JUNE AS I SAT READING THE BRITISH MEDICAL
JOURNAL AFTER BREAKFAST I HEARD A RING AT THE BELL FOLLOWED BY THE
HIGH SOMEWHAT STRIDENT TONES OF MY OLD COMPANIONS VOICE
AH MY DEAR WATSON SAID HE STRIDING INTO THE ROOM I AM VERY
DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU I TRUST THAT MRS WATSON HAS ENTIRELY RECOVERED
FROM ALL THE LITTLE EXCITEMENTS CONNECTED WITH OUR ADVENTURE OF THE
SIGN OF FOUR
THANK YOU WE ARE BOTH VERY WELL SAID I SHAKING HIM WARMLY BY THE
HAND
AND I HOPE ALSO HE CONTINUED SITTING DOWN IN THE ROCKINGCHAIR
THAT THE CARES OF MEDICAL PRACTICE HAVE NOT ENTIRELY OBLITERATED THE
INTEREST WHICH YOU USED TO TAKE IN OUR LITTLE DEDUCTIVE PROBLEMS
ON THE CONTRARY I ANSWERED IT WAS ONLY LAST NIGHT THAT I WAS
LOOKING OVER MY OLD NOTES AND CLASSIFYING SOME OF OUR PAST RESULTS
I TRUST THAT YOU DONT CONSIDER YOUR COLLECTION CLOSED
NOT AT ALL I SHOULD WISH NOTHING BETTER THAN TO HAVE SOME MORE OF
SUCH EXPERIENCES
TODAY FOR EXAMPLE
YES TODAY IF YOU LIKE
AND AS FAR OFF AS BIRMINGHAM
CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH IT
AND THE PRACTICE
I DO MY NEIGHBORS WHEN HE GOES HE IS ALWAYS READY TO WORK OFF THE
DEBT
HA NOTHING COULD BE BETTER SAID HOLMES LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR
AND LOOKING KEENLY AT ME FROM UNDER HIS HALF CLOSED LIDS I PERCEIVE
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN UNWELL LATELY SUMMER COLDS ARE ALWAYS A LITTLE
TRYING
I WAS CONFINED TO THE HOUSE BY A SEVERE CHILL FOR THREE DAYS LAST
WEEK I THOUGHT HOWEVER THAT I HAD CAST OFF EVERY TRACE OF IT
SO YOU HAVE YOU LOOK REMARKABLY ROBUST
HOW THEN DID YOU KNOW OF IT
MY DEAR FELLOW YOU KNOW MY METHODS
YOU DEDUCED IT THEN
CERTAINLY
AND FROM WHAT
FROM YOUR SLIPPERS
I GLANCED DOWN AT THE NEW PATENT LEATHERS WHICH I WAS WEARING HOW
ON EARTH I BEGAN BUT HOLMES ANSWERED MY QUESTION BEFORE IT WAS
ASKED
YOUR SLIPPERS ARE NEW HE SAID YOU COULD NOT HAVE HAD THEM MORE
THAN A FEW WEEKS THE SOLES WHICH YOU ARE AT THIS MOMENT PRESENTING
TO ME ARE SLIGHTLY SCORCHED FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT HAVE
GOT WET AND BEEN BURNED IN THE DRYING BUT NEAR THE INSTEP THERE IS A
SMALL CIRCULAR WAFER OF PAPER WITH THE SHOPMANS HIEROGLYPHICS UPON
IT DAMP WOULD OF COURSE HAVE REMOVED THIS YOU HAD THEN BEEN
SITTING WITH OUR FEET OUTSTRETCHED TO THE FIRE WHICH A MAN WOULD
HARDLY DO EVEN IN SO WET A JUNE AS THIS IF HE WERE IN HIS FULL
HEALTH
LIKE ALL HOLMESS REASONING THE THING SEEMED SIMPLICITY ITSELF WHEN
IT WAS ONCE EXPLAINED HE READ THE THOUGHT UPON MY FEATURES AND HIS
SMILE HAD A TINGE OF BITTERNESS
I AM AFRAID THAT I RATHER GIVE MYSELF AWAY WHEN I EXPLAIN SAID HE
RESULTS WITHOUT CAUSES ARE MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE YOU ARE READY TO
COME TO BIRMINGHAM THEN
CERTAINLY WHAT IS THE CASE
YOU SHALL HEAR IT ALL IN THE TRAIN MY CLIENT IS OUTSIDE IN A
FOURWHEELER CAN YOU COME AT ONCE
IN AN INSTANT I SCRIBBLED A NOTE TO MY NEIGHBOR RUSHED UPSTAIRS
TO EXPLAIN THE MATTER TO MY WIFE AND JOINED HOLMES UPON THE
DOORSTEP
YOUR NEIGHBOR IS A DOCTOR SAID HE NODDING AT THE BRASS PLATE
YES HE BOUGHT A PRACTICE AS I DID
AN OLDESTABLISHED ONE
JUST THE SAME AS MINE BOTH HAVE BEEN EVER SINCE THE HOUSES WERE
BUILT
AH THEN YOU GOT HOLD OF THE BEST OF THE TWO
I THINK I DID BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW
BY THE STEPS MY BOY YOURS ARE WORN THREE INCHES DEEPER THAN HIS
BUT THIS GENTLEMAN IN THE CAB IS MY CLIENT MR HALL PYCROFT ALLOW
ME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO HIM WHIP YOUR HORSE UP CABBY FOR WE HAVE
ONLY JUST TIME TO CATCH OUR TRAIN
THE MAN WHOM I FOUND MYSELF FACING WAS A WELL BUILT
FRESHCOMPLEXIONED YOUNG FELLOW WITH A FRANK HONEST FACE AND A
SLIGHT CRISP YELLOW MUSTACHE HE WORE A VERY SHINY TOP HAT AND A
NEAT SUIT OF SOBER BLACK WHICH MADE HIM LOOK WHAT HE WASA SMART
YOUNG CITY MAN OF THE CLASS WHO HAVE BEEN LABELED COCKNEYS BUT WHO
GIVE US OUR CRACK VOLUNTEER REGIMENTS AND WHO TURN OUT MORE FINE
ATHLETES AND SPORTSMEN THAN ANY BODY OF MEN IN THESE ISLANDS HIS
ROUND RUDDY FACE WAS NATURALLY FULL OF CHEERINESS BUT THE CORNERS
OF HIS MOUTH SEEMED TO ME TO BE PULLED DOWN IN A HALFCOMICAL
DISTRESS IT WAS NOT HOWEVER UNTIL WE WERE ALL IN A FIRSTCLASS
CARRIAGE AND WELL STARTED UPON OUR JOURNEY TO BIRMINGHAM THAT I WAS
ABLE TO LEARN WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS WHICH HAD DRIVEN HIM TO SHERLOCK
HOLMES
WE HAVE A CLEAR RUN HERE OF SEVENTY MINUTES HOLMES REMARKED I
WANT YOU MR HALL PYCROFT TO TELL MY FRIEND YOUR VERY INTERESTING
EXPERIENCE EXACTLY AS YOU HAVE TOLD IT TO ME OR WITH MORE DETAIL IF
POSSIBLE IT WILL BE OF USE TO ME TO HEAR THE SUCCESSION OF EVENTS
AGAIN IT IS A CASE WATSON WHICH MAY PROVE TO HAVE SOMETHING IN IT
OR MAY PROVE TO HAVE NOTHING BUT WHICH AT LEAST PRESENTS THOSE
UNUSUAL AND OUTR FEATURES WHICH ARE AS DEAR TO YOU AS THEY ARE TO
ME NOW MR PYCROFT I SHALL NOT INTERRUPT YOU AGAIN
OUR YOUNG COMPANION LOOKED AT ME WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE
THE WORST OF THE STORY IS SAID HE THAT I SHOW MYSELF UP AS SUCH
A CONFOUNDED FOOL OF COURSE IT MAY WORK OUT ALL RIGHT AND I DONT
SEE THAT I COULD HAVE DONE OTHERWISE BUT IF I HAVE LOST MY CRIB AND
GET NOTHING IN EXCHANGE I SHALL FEEL WHAT A SOFT JOHNNIE I HAVE BEEN
IM NOT VERY GOOD AT TELLING A STORY DR WATSON BUT IT IS LIKE THIS
WITH ME
I USED TO HAVE A BILLET AT COXON WOODHOUSES OF DRAPERS GARDENS
BUT THEY WERE LET IN EARLY IN THE SPRING THROUGH THE VENEZUELAN LOAN
AS NO DOUBT YOU REMEMBER AND CAME A NASTY CROPPER I HAD BEEN WITH
THEM FIVE YEARS AND OLD COXON GAVE ME A RIPPING GOOD TESTIMONIAL
WHEN THE SMASH CAME BUT OF COURSE WE CLERKS WERE ALL TURNED ADRIFT
THE TWENTYSEVEN OF US I TRIED HERE AND TRIED THERE BUT THERE WERE
LOTS OF OTHER CHAPS ON THE SAME LAY AS MYSELF AND IT WAS A PERFECT
FROST FOR A LONG TIME I HAD BEEN TAKING THREE POUNDS A WEEK AT
COXONS AND I HAD SAVED ABOUT SEVENTY OF THEM BUT I SOON WORKED MY
WAY THROUGH THAT AND OUT AT THE OTHER END I WAS FAIRLY AT THE END OF
MY TETHER AT LAST AND COULD HARDLY FIND THE STAMPS TO ANSWER THE
ADVERTISEMENTS OR THE ENVELOPES TO STICK THEM TO I HAD WORN OUT MY
BOOTS PADDLING UP OFFICE STAIRS AND I SEEMED JUST AS FAR FROM
GETTING A BILLET AS EVER
AT LAST I SAW A VACANCY AT MAWSON WILLIAMSS THE GREAT
STOCKBROKING FIRM IN LOMBARD STREET I DARE SAY E C IS NOT MUCH IN
YOUR LINE BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS ABOUT THE RICHEST HOUSE IN
LONDON THE ADVERTISEMENT WAS TO BE ANSWERED BY LETTER ONLY I SENT
IN MY TESTIMONIAL AND APPLICATION BUT WITHOUT THE LEAST HOPE OF
GETTING IT BACK CAME AN ANSWER BY RETURN SAYING THAT IF I WOULD
APPEAR NEXT MONDAY I MIGHT TAKE OVER MY NEW DUTIES AT ONCE PROVIDED
THAT MY APPEARANCE WAS SATISFACTORY NO ONE KNOWS HOW THESE THINGS
ARE WORKED SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THE MANAGER JUST PLUNGES HIS HAND
INTO THE HEAP AND TAKES THE FIRST THAT COMES ANYHOW IT WAS MY
INNINGS THAT TIME AND I DONT EVER WISH TO FEEL BETTER PLEASED THE
SCREW WAS A POUND A WEEK RISE AND THE DUTIES JUST ABOUT THE SAME AS
AT COXONS
AND NOW I COME TO THE QUEER PART OF THE BUSINESS I WAS IN DIGGINGS
OUT HAMPSTEAD WAY POTTERS TERRACE WELL I WAS SITTING DOING A
SMOKE THAT VERY EVENING AFTER I HAD BEEN PROMISED THE APPOINTMENT
WHEN UP CAME MY LANDLADY WITH A CARD WHICH HAD ARTHUR PINNER
FINANCIAL AGENT PRINTED UPON IT I HAD NEVER HEARD THE NAME BEFORE
AND COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT HE WANTED WITH ME BUT OF COURSE I ASKED
HER TO SHOW HIM UP IN HE WALKED A MIDDLESIZED DARKHAIRED
DARKEYED BLACKBEARDED MAN WITH A TOUCH OF THE SHEENY ABOUT HIS
NOSE HE HAD A BRISK KIND OF WAY WITH HIM AND SPOKE SHARPLY LIKE A
MAN WHO KNEW THE VALUE OF TIME
MR HALL PYCROFT I BELIEVE SAID HE
YES SIR I ANSWERED PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
LATELY ENGAGED AT COXON WOODHOUSES
YES SIR
AND NOW ON THE STAFF OF MAWSONS
QUITE SO
WELL SAID HE THE FACT IS THAT I HAVE HEARD SOME REALLY
EXTRAORDINARY STORIES ABOUT YOUR FINANCIAL ABILITY YOU REMEMBER

IN THE OFFICE BUT I HAD NEVER DREAMED THAT I WAS TALKED ABOUT IN THE
CITY IN THIS FASHION

FORTUNE THAT YOU DESERVE
THATS JUST ABOUT ALL THAT PASSED BETWEEN US AS NEAR AS I CAN
REMEMBER YOU CAN IMAGINE DR WATSON HOW PLEASED I WAS AT SUCH AN
EXTRAORDINARY BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE I SAT UP HALF THE NIGHT HUGGING
MYSELF OVER IT AND NEXT DAY I WAS OFF TO BIRMINGHAM IN A TRAIN THAT
WOULD TAKE ME IN PLENTY TIME FOR MY APPOINTMENT I TOOK MY THINGS TO
A HOTEL IN NEW STREET AND THEN I MADE MY WAY TO THE ADDRESS WHICH
HAD BEEN GIVEN ME
IT WAS A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE MY TIME BUT I THOUGHT THAT WOULD
MAKE NO DIFFERENCE B WAS A PASSAGE BETWEEN TWO LARGE SHOPS WHICH
LED TO A WINDING STONE STAIR FROM WHICH THERE WERE MANY FLATS LET
AS OFFICES TO COMPANIES OR PROFESSIONAL MEN THE NAMES OF THE
OCCUPANTS WERE PAINTED AT THE BOTTOM ON THE WALL BUT THERE WAS NO
SUCH NAME AS THE FRANCOMIDLAND HARDWARE COMPANY LIMITED I STOOD
FOR A FEW MINUTES WITH MY HEART IN MY BOOTS WONDERING WHETHER THE
WHOLE THING WAS AN ELABORATE HOAX OR NOT WHEN UP CAME A MAN AND
ADDRESSED ME HE WAS VERY LIKE THE CHAP I HAD SEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
THE SAME FIGURE AND VOICE BUT HE WAS CLEAN SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR WAS
LIGHTER
ARE YOU MR HALL PYCROFT HE ASKED
YES SAID I
OH I WAS EXPECTING YOU BUT YOU ARE A TRIFLE BEFORE YOUR TIME I
HAD A NOTE FROM MY BROTHER THIS MORNING IN WHICH HE SANG YOUR PRAISES
VERY LOUDLY
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR THE OFFICES WHEN YOU CAME
WE HAVE NOT GOT OUR NAME UP YET FOR WE ONLY SECURED THESE
TEMPORARY PREMISES LAST WEEK COME UP WITH ME AND WE WILL TALK THE
MATTER OVER
I FOLLOWED HIM TO THE TOP OF A VERY LOFTY STAIR AND THERE RIGHT
UNDER THE SLATES WERE A COUPLE OF EMPTY DUSTY LITTLE ROOMS
UNCARPETED AND UNCURTAINED INTO WHICH HE LED ME I HAD THOUGHT OF A
GREAT OFFICE WITH SHINING TABLES AND ROWS OF CLERKS SUCH AS I WAS
USED TO AND I DARE SAY I STARED RATHER STRAIGHT AT THE TWO DEAL
CHAIRS AND ONE LITTLE TABLE WHICH WITH A LEDGER AND A WASTE PAPER

HOW
FOR ANSWER HE TOOK A BIG RED BOOK OUT OF A DRAWER
THIS IS A DIRECTORY OF PARIS SAID HE WITH THE TRADES AFTER THE
NAMES OF THE PEOPLE I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT HOME WITH YOU AND TO MARK
OFF ALL THE HARDWARE SELLERS WITH THEIR ADDRESSES IT WOULD BE OF
THE GREATEST USE TO ME TO HAVE THEM

NOT RELIABLE ONES THEIR SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT FROM OURS STICK AT
IT AND LET ME HAVE THE LISTS BY MONDAY AT TWELVE GOODDAY MR
PYCROFT IF YOU CONTINUE TO SHOW ZEAL AND INTELLIGENCE YOU WILL FIND
THE COMPANY A GOOD MASTER
I WENT BACK TO THE HOTEL WITH THE BIG BOOK UNDER MY ARM AND WITH
VERY CONFLICTING FEELINGS IN MY BREAST ON THE ONE HAND I WAS
DEFINITELY ENGAGED AND HAD A HUNDRED POUNDS IN MY POCKET ON THE
OTHER THE LOOK OF THE OFFICES THE ABSENCE OF NAME ON THE WALL AND
OTHER OF THE POINTS WHICH WOULD STRIKE A BUSINESS MAN HAD LEFT A BAD
IMPRESSION AS TO THE POSITION OF MY EMPLOYERS HOWEVER COME WHAT
MIGHT I HAD MY MONEY SO I SETTLED DOWN TO MY TASK ALL SUNDAY I WAS
KEPT HARD AT WORK AND YET BY MONDAY I HAD ONLY GOT AS FAR AS H I
WENT ROUND TO MY EMPLOYER FOUND HIM IN THE SAME DISMANTLED KIND OF
ROOM AND WAS TOLD TO KEEP AT IT UNTIL WEDNESDAY AND THEN COME
AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY IT WAS STILL UNFINISHED SO I HAMMERED AWAY UNTIL
FRIDAYTHAT IS YESTERDAY THEN I BROUGHT IT ROUND TO MR HARRY
PINNER
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAID HE I FEAR THAT I UNDERRATED THE
DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK THIS LIST WILL BE OF VERY MATERIAL ASSISTANCE
TO ME
IT TOOK SOME TIME SAID I
AND NOW SAID HE I WANT YOU TO MAKE A LIST OF THE FURNITURE
SHOPS FOR THEY ALL SELL CROCKERY
VERY GOOD
AND YOU CAN COME UP TOMORROW EVENING AT SEVEN AND LET ME KNOW
HOW YOU ARE GETTING ON DONT OVERWORK YOURSELF A COUPLE OF HOURS AT
DAYS MUSIC HALL IN THE EVENING WOULD DO YOU NO HARM AFTER YOUR
LABORS HE LAUGHED AS HE SPOKE AND I SAW WITH A THRILL THAT HIS
SECOND TOOTH UPON THE LEFTHAND SIDE HAD BEEN VERY BADLY STUFFED WITH
GOLD
SHERLOCK HOLMES RUBBED HIS HANDS WITH DELIGHT AND I STARED WITH
ASTONISHMENT AT OUR CLIENT
YOU MAY WELL LOOK SURPRISED DR WATSON BUT IT IS THIS WAY SAID
HE WHEN I WAS SPEAKING TO THE OTHER CHAP IN LONDON AT THE TIME
THAT HE LAUGHED AT MY NOT GOING TO MAWSONS I HAPPENED TO NOTICE
THAT HIS TOOTH WAS STUFFED IN THIS VERY IDENTICAL FASHION THE GLINT
OF THE GOLD IN EACH CASE CAUGHT MY EYE YOU SEE WHEN I PUT THAT WITH
THE VOICE AND FIGURE BEING THE SAME AND ONLY THOSE THINGS ALTERED
WHICH MIGHT BE CHANGED BY A RAZOR OR A WIG I COULD NOT DOUBT THAT IT
WAS THE SAME MAN OF COURSE YOU EXPECT TWO BROTHERS TO BE ALIKE BUT
NOT THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME TOOTH STUFFED IN THE SAME WAY HE
BOWED ME OUT AND I FOUND MYSELF IN THE STREET HARDLY KNOWING
WHETHER I WAS ON MY HEAD OR MY HEELS BACK I WENT TO MY HOTEL PUT MY
HEAD IN A BASIN OF COLD WATER AND TRIED TO THINK IT OUT WHY HAD HE
SENT ME FROM LONDON TO BIRMINGHAM WHY HAD HE GOT THERE BEFORE ME
AND WHY HAD HE WRITTEN A LETTER FROM HIMSELF TO HIMSELF IT WAS
ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH FOR ME AND I COULD MAKE NO SENSE OF IT AND THEN
SUDDENLY IT STRUCK ME THAT WHAT WAS DARK TO ME MIGHT BE VERY LIGHT TO
MR SHERLOCK HOLMES I HAD JUST TIME TO GET UP TO TOWN BY THE NIGHT
TRAIN TO SEE HIM THIS MORNING AND TO BRING YOU BOTH BACK WITH ME TO
BIRMINGHAM
THERE WAS A PAUSE AFTER THE STOCKBROKERS CLERK HAD CONCLUDED HIS
SURPRISING EXPERIENCE THEN SHERLOCK HOLMES COCKED HIS EYE AT ME
LEANING BACK ON THE CUSHIONS WITH A PLEASED AND YET CRITICAL FACE
LIKE A CONNOISSEUR WHO HAS JUST TAKEN HIS FIRST SIP OF A COMET
VINTAGE
RATHER FINE WATSON IS IT NOT SAID HE THERE ARE POINTS IN IT
WHICH PLEASE ME I THINK THAT YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT AN
INTERVIEW WITH MR ARTHUR HARRY PINNER IN THE TEMPORARY OFFICES OF
THE FRANCOMIDLAND HARDWARE COMPANY LIMITED WOULD BE A RATHER
INTERESTING EXPERIENCE FOR BOTH OF US
BUT HOW CAN WE DO IT I ASKED
OH EASILY ENOUGH SAID HALL PYCROFT CHEERILY YOU ARE TWO
FRIENDS OF MINE WHO ARE IN WANT OF A BILLET AND WHAT COULD BE MORE
NATURAL THAN THAT I SHOULD BRING YOU BOTH ROUND TO THE MANAGING
DIRECTOR
QUITE SO OF COURSE SAID HOLMES I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LOOK AT
THE GENTLEMAN AND SEE IF I CAN MAKE ANYTHING OF HIS LITTLE GAME
WHAT QUALITIES HAVE YOU MY FRIEND WHICH WOULD MAKE YOUR SERVICES SO
VALUABLE OR IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE BEGAN BITING HIS NAILS AND
STARING BLANKLY OUT OF THE WINDOW AND WE HARDLY DREW ANOTHER WORD
FROM HIM UNTIL WE WERE IN NEW STREET
AT SEVEN OCLOCK THAT EVENING WE WERE WALKING THE THREE OF US DOWN
CORPORATION STREET TO THE COMPANYS OFFICES
IT IS NO USE OUR BEING AT ALL BEFORE OUR TIME SAID OUR CLIENT HE
ONLY COMES THERE TO SEE ME APPARENTLY FOR THE PLACE IS DESERTED UP
TO THE VERY HOUR HE NAMES
THAT IS SUGGESTIVE REMARKED HOLMES
BY JOVE I TOLD YOU SO CRIED THE CLERK THATS HE WALKING AHEAD
OF US THERE
HE POINTED TO A SMALLISH DARK WELLDRESSED MAN WHO WAS BUSTLING
ALONG THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD AS WE WATCHED HIM HE LOOKED ACROSS
AT A BOY WHO WAS BAWLING OUT THE LATEST EDITION OF THE EVENING PAPER
AND RUNNING OVER AMONG THE CABS AND BUSSES HE BOUGHT ONE FROM HIM
THEN CLUTCHING IT IN HIS HAND HE VANISHED THROUGH A DOORWAY
THERE HE GOES CRIED HALL PYCROFT THESE ARE THE COMPANYS OFFICES
INTO WHICH HE HAS GONE COME WITH ME AND ILL FIX IT UP AS EASILY AS
POSSIBLE
FOLLOWING HIS LEAD WE ASCENDED FIVE STORIES UNTIL WE FOUND
OURSELVES OUTSIDE A HALFOPENED DOOR AT WHICH OUR CLIENT TAPPED A
VOICE WITHIN BADE US ENTER AND WE ENTERED A BARE UNFURNISHED ROOM
SUCH AS HALL PYCROFT HAD DESCRIBED AT THE SINGLE TABLE SAT THE MAN
WHOM WE HAD SEEN IN THE STREET WITH HIS EVENING PAPER SPREAD OUT IN
FRONT OF HIM AND AS HE LOOKED UP AT US IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD
NEVER LOOKED UPON A FACE WHICH BORE SUCH MARKS OF GRIEF AND OF
SOMETHING BEYOND GRIEFOF A HORROR SUCH AS COMES TO FEW MEN IN A
LIFETIME HIS BROW GLISTENED WITH PERSPIRATION HIS CHEEKS WERE OF
THE DULL DEAD WHITE OF A FISHS BELLY AND HIS EYES WERE WILD AND
STARING HE LOOKED AT HIS CLERK AS THOUGH HE FAILED TO RECOGNIZE HIM
AND I COULD SEE BY THE ASTONISHMENT DEPICTED UPON OUR CONDUCTORS
FACE THAT THIS WAS BY NO MEANS THE USUAL APPEARANCE OF HIS EMPLOYER
YOU LOOK ILL MR PINNER HE EXCLAIMED
YES I AM NOT VERY WELL ANSWERED THE OTHER MAKING OBVIOUS EFFORTS
TO PULL HIMSELF TOGETHER AND LICKING HIS DRY LIPS BEFORE HE SPOKE
WHO ARE THESE GENTLEMEN WHOM YOU HAVE BROUGHT WITH YOU
ONE IS MR HARRIS OF BERMONDSEY AND THE OTHER IS MR PRICE OF
THIS TOWN SAID OUR CLERK GLIBLY THEY ARE FRIENDS OF MINE AND
GENTLEMEN OF EXPERIENCE BUT THEY HAVE BEEN OUT OF A PLACE FOR SOME
LITTLE TIME AND THEY HOPED THAT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT FIND AN OPENING
FOR THEM IN THE COMPANYS EMPLOYMENT
VERY POSSIBLY VERY POSSIBLY CRIED MR PINNER WITH A GHASTLY
SMILE YES I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING
FOR YOU WHAT IS YOUR PARTICULAR LINE MR HARRIS
I AM AN ACCOUNTANT SAID HOLMES
AH YES WE SHALL WANT SOMETHING OF THE SORT AND YOU MR PRICE
A CLERK SAID I
I HAVE EVERY HOPE THAT THE COMPANY MAY ACCOMMODATE YOU I WILL LET
YOU KNOW ABOUT IT AS SOON AS WE COME TO ANY CONCLUSION AND NOW I BEG
THAT YOU WILL GO FOR GODS SAKE LEAVE ME TO MYSELF
THESE LAST WORDS WERE SHOT OUT OF HIM AS THOUGH THE CONSTRAINT WHICH
HE WAS EVIDENTLY SETTING UPON HIMSELF HAD SUDDENLY AND UTTERLY BURST
ASUNDER HOLMES AND I GLANCED AT EACH OTHER AND HALL PYCROFT TOOK A
STEP TOWARDS THE TABLE
YOU FORGET MR PINNER THAT I AM HERE BY APPOINTMENT TO RECEIVE
SOME DIRECTIONS FROM YOU SAID HE
CERTAINLY MR PYCROFT CERTAINLY THE OTHER RESUMED IN A CALMER
TONE YOU MAY WAIT HERE A MOMENT AND THERE IS NO REASON WHY YOUR
FRIENDS SHOULD NOT WAIT WITH YOU I WILL BE ENTIRELY AT YOUR SERVICE
IN THREE MINUTES IF I MIGHT TRESPASS UPON YOUR PATIENCE SO FAR HE
ROSE WITH A VERY COURTEOUS AIR AND BOWING TO US HE PASSED OUT
THROUGH A DOOR AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM WHICH HE CLOSED BEHIND
HIM
WHAT NOW WHISPERED HOLMES IS HE GIVING US THE SLIP
IMPOSSIBLE ANSWERED PYCROFT
WHY SO
THAT DOOR LEADS INTO AN INNER ROOM
THERE IS NO EXIT
NONE
IS IT FURNISHED
IT WAS EMPTY YESTERDAY
THEN WHAT ON EARTH CAN HE BE DOING THERE IS SOMETHING WHICH I DONT
UNDERSTAND IN HIS MANNER IF EVER A MAN WAS THREE PARTS MAD WITH
TERROR THAT MANS NAME IS PINNER WHAT CAN HAVE PUT THE SHIVERS ON
HIM
HE SUSPECTS THAT WE ARE DETECTIVES I SUGGESTED
THATS IT CRIED PYCROFT
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD HE DID NOT TURN PALE HE WAS PALE WHEN WE
ENTERED THE ROOM SAID HE IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT
HIS WORDS WERE INTERRUPTED BY A SHARP RATTAT FROM THE DIRECTION OF
THE INNER DOOR
WHAT THE DEUCE IS HE KNOCKING AT HIS OWN DOOR FOR CRIED THE CLERK
AGAIN AND MUCH LOUDER CAM THE RATTATTAT WE ALL GAZED EXPECTANTLY
AT THE CLOSED DOOR GLANCING AT HOLMES I SAW HIS FACE TURN RIGID
AND HE LEANED FORWARD IN INTENSE EXCITEMENT THEN SUDDENLY CAME A LOW
GUGGLING GARGLING SOUND AND A BRISK DRUMMING UPON WOODWORK HOLMES
SPRANG FRANTICALLY ACROSS THE ROOM AND PUSHED AT THE DOOR IT WAS
FASTENED ON THE INNER SIDE FOLLOWING HIS EXAMPLE WE THREW OURSELVES
UPON IT WITH ALL OUR WEIGHT ONE HINGE SNAPPED THEN THE OTHER AND
DOWN CAME THE DOOR WITH A CRASH RUSHING OVER IT WE FOUND OURSELVES
IN THE INNER ROOM IT WAS EMPTY
BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT THAT WE WERE AT FAULT AT ONE CORNER
THE CORNER NEAREST THE ROOM WHICH WE HAD LEFT THERE WAS A SECOND
DOOR HOLMES SPRANG TO IT AND PULLED IT OPEN A COAT AND WAISTCOAT
WERE LYING ON THE FLOOR AND FROM A HOOK BEHIND THE DOOR WITH HIS
OWN BRACES ROUND HIS NECK WAS HANGING THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE
FRANCOMIDLAND HARDWARE COMPANY HIS KNEES WERE DRAWN UP HIS HEAD
HUNG AT A DREADFUL ANGLE TO HIS BODY AND THE CLATTER OF HIS HEELS
AGAINST THE DOOR MADE THE NOISE WHICH HAD BROKEN IN UPON OUR
CONVERSATION IN AN INSTANT I HAD CAUGHT HIM ROUND THE WAIST AND
HELD HIM UP WHILE HOLMES AND PYCROFT UNTIED THE ELASTIC BANDS WHICH
HAD DISAPPEARED BETWEEN THE LIVID CREASES OF SKIN THEN WE CARRIED
HIM INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE HE LAY WITH A CLAYCOLORED FACE
PUFFING HIS PURPLE LIPS IN AND OUT WITH EVERY BREATHA DREADFUL
WRECK OF ALL THAT HE HAD BEEN BUT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM WATSON ASKED HOLMES
I STOOPED OVER HIM AND EXAMINED HIM HIS PULSE WAS FEEBLE AND
INTERMITTENT BUT HIS BREATHING GREW LONGER AND THERE WAS A LITTLE
SHIVERING OF HIS EYELIDS WHICH SHOWED A THIN WHITE SLIT OF BALL
BENEATH
IT HAS BEEN TOUCH AND GO WITH HIM SAID I BUT HELL LIVE NOW
JUST OPEN THAT WINDOW AND HAND ME THE WATER CARAFE I UNDID HIS
COLLAR POURED THE COLD WATER OVER HIS FACE AND RAISED AND SANK HIS
ARMS UNTIL HE DREW A LONG NATURAL BREATH ITS ONLY A QUESTION OF
TIME NOW SAID I AS I TURNED AWAY FROM HIM
HOLMES STOOD BY THE TABLE WITH HIS HANDS DEEP IN HIS TROUSERS
POCKETS AND HIS CHIN UPON HIS BREAST
I SUPPOSE WE OUGHT TO CALL THE POLICE IN NOW SAID HE AND YET I
CONFESS THAT ID LIKE TO GIVE THEM A COMPLETE CASE WHEN THEY COME
ITS A BLESSED MYSTERY TO ME CRIED PYCROFT SCRATCHING HIS HEAD
WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO BRING ME ALL THE WAY UP HERE FOR AND
THEN
POOH ALL THAT IS CLEAR ENOUGH SAID HOLMES IMPATIENTLY IT IS
THIS LAST SUDDEN MOVE
YOU UNDERSTAND THE REST THEN
I THINK THAT IT IS FAIRLY OBVIOUS WHAT DO YOU SAY WATSON
I SHRUGGED MY SHOULDERS I MUST CONFESS THAT I AM OUT OF MY DEPTHS
SAID I
OH SURELY IF YOU CONSIDER THE EVENTS AT FIRST THEY CAN ONLY POINT TO
ONE CONCLUSION
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THEM
WELL THE WHOLE THING HINGES UPON TWO POINTS THE FIRST IS THE
MAKING OF PYCROFT WRITE A DECLARATION BY WHICH HE ENTERED THE SERVICE
OF THIS PREPOSTEROUS COMPANY DO YOU NOT SEE HOW VERY SUGGESTIVE THAT
IS
I AM AFRAID I MISS THE POINT
WELL WHY DID THEY WANT HIM TO DO IT NOT AS A BUSINESS MATTER FOR
THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE USUALLY VERBAL AND THERE WAS NO EARTHLY
BUSINESS REASON WHY THIS SHOULD BE AN EXCEPTION DONT YOU SEE MY
YOUNG FRIEND THAT THEY WERE VERY ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN A SPECIMEN OF
YOUR HANDWRITING AND HAD NO OTHER WAY OF DOING IT
AND WHY
QUITE SO WHY WHEN WE ANSWER THAT WE HAVE MADE SOME PROGRESS WITH
OUR LITTLE PROBLEM WHY THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE ADEQUATE REASON
SOMEONE WANTED TO LEARN TO IMITATE YOUR WRITING AND HAD TO PROCURE A
SPECIMEN OF IT FIRST AND NOW IF WE PASS ON TO THE SECOND POINT WE
FIND THAT EACH THROWS LIGHT UPON THE OTHER THAT POINT IS THE REQUEST
MADE BY PINNER THAT YOU SHOULD NOT RESIGN YOUR PLACE BUT SHOULD
LEAVE THE MANAGER OF THIS IMPORTANT BUSINESS IN THE FULL EXPECTATION
THAT A MR HALL PYCROFT WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN WAS ABOUT TO ENTER
THE OFFICE UPON THE MONDAY MORNING
MY GOD CRIED OUR CLIENT WHAT A BLIND BEETLE I HAVE BEEN
NOW YOU SEE THE POINT ABOUT THE HANDWRITING SUPPOSE THAT SOME ONE
TURNED UP IN YOUR PLACE WHO WROTE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HAND FROM
THAT IN WHICH YOU HAD APPLIED FOR THE VACANCY OF COURSE THE GAME
WOULD HAVE BEEN UP BUT IN THE INTERVAL THE ROGUE HAD LEARNED TO
IMITATE YOU AND HIS POSITION WAS THEREFORE SECURE AS I PRESUME THAT
NOBODY IN THE OFFICE HAD EVER SET EYES UPON YOU
NOT A SOUL GROANED HALL PYCROFT
VERY GOOD OF COURSE IT WAS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO PREVENT YOU
FROM THINKING BETTER OF IT AND ALSO TO KEEP YOU FROM COMING INTO
CONTACT WITH ANY ONE WHO MIGHT TELL YOU THAT YOUR DOUBLE WAS AT WORK
IN MAWSONS OFFICE THEREFORE THEY GAVE YOU A HANDSOME ADVANCE ON
YOUR SALARY AND RAN YOU OFF TO THE MIDLANDS WHERE THEY GAVE YOU
ENOUGH WORK TO DO TO PREVENT YOUR GOING TO LONDON WHERE YOU MIGHT
HAVE BURST THEIR LITTLE GAME UP THAT IS ALL PLAIN ENOUGH
BUT WHY SHOULD THIS MAN PRETEND TO BE HIS OWN BROTHER
WELL THAT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO THERE ARE EVIDENTLY ONLY TWO OF
THEM IN IT THE OTHER IS IMPERSONATING YOU AT THE OFFICE THIS ONE
ACTED AS YOUR ENGAGER AND THEN FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT FIND YOU AN
EMPLOYER WITHOUT ADMITTING A THIRD PERSON INTO HIS PLOT THAT HE WAS
MOST UNWILLING TO DO HE CHANGED HIS APPEARANCE AS FAR AS HE COULD
AND TRUSTED THAT THE LIKENESS WHICH YOU COULD NOT FAIL TO OBSERVE
WOULD BE PUT DOWN TO A FAMILY RESEMBLANCE BUT FOR THE HAPPY CHANCE
OF THE GOLD STUFFING YOUR SUSPICIONS WOULD PROBABLY NEVER HAVE BEEN
AROUSED
HALL PYCROFT SHOOK HIS CLINCHED HANDS IN THE AIR GOOD LORD HE
CRIED WHILE I HAVE BEEN FOOLED IN THIS WAY WHAT HAS THIS OTHER
HALL PYCROFT BEEN DOING AT MAWSONS WHAT SHOULD WE DO MR HOLMES
TELL ME WHAT TO DO
WE MUST WIRE TO MAWSONS
THEY SHUT AT TWELVE ON SATURDAYS
NEVER MIND THERE MAY BE SOME DOORKEEPER OR ATTENDANT
AH YES THEY KEEP A PERMANENT GUARD THERE ON ACCOUNT OF THE VALUE OF
THE SECURITIES THAT THEY HOLD I REMEMBER HEARING IT TALKED OF IN THE
CITY
VERY GOOD WE SHALL WIRE TO HIM AND SEE IF ALL IS WELL AND IF A
CLERK OF YOUR NAME IS WORKING THERE THAT IS CLEAR ENOUGH BUT WHAT
IS NOT SO CLEAR IS WHY AT SIGHT OF US ONE OF THE ROGUES SHOULD
INSTANTLY WALK OUT OF THE ROOM AND HANG HIMSELF
THE PAPER CROAKED A VOICE BEHIND US THE MAN WAS SITTING UP
BLANCHED AND GHASTLY WITH RETURNING REASON IN HIS EYES AND HANDS
WHICH RUBBED NERVOUSLY AT THE BROAD RED BAND WHICH STILL ENCIRCLED
HIS THROAT
THE PAPER OF COURSE YELLED HOLMES IN A PAROXYSM OF EXCITEMENT
IDIOT THAT I WAS I THOUGHT SO MUST OF OUR VISIT THAT THE PAPER
NEVER ENTERED MY HEAD FOR AN INSTANT TO BE SURE THE SECRET MUST BE
THERE HE FLATTENED IT OUT UPON THE TABLE AND A CRY OF TRIUMPH
BURST FROM HIS LIPS LOOK AT THIS WATSON HE CRIED IT IS A
LONDON PAPER AN EARLY EDITION OF THE EVENING STANDARD HERE IS WHAT
WE WANT LOOK AT THE HEADLINES CRIME IN THE CITY MURDER AT MAWSON
WILLIAMSS GIGANTIC ATTEMPTED ROBBERY CAPTURE OF THE CRIMINAL
HERE WATSON WE ARE ALL EQUALLY ANXIOUS TO HEAR IT SO KINDLY READ
IT ALOUD TO US
IT APPEARED FROM ITS POSITION IN THE PAPER TO HAVE BEEN THE ONE EVENT
OF IMPORTANCE IN TOWN AND THE ACCOUNT OF IT RAN IN THIS WAY
A DESPERATE ATTEMPT AT ROBBERY CULMINATING IN THE DEATH OF ONE MAN
AND THE CAPTURE OF THE CRIMINAL OCCURRED THIS AFTERNOON IN THE CITY
FOR SOME TIME BACK MAWSON WILLIAMS THE FAMOUS FINANCIAL HOUSE
HAVE BEEN THE GUARDIANS OF SECURITIES WHICH AMOUNT IN THE AGGREGATE
TO A SUM OF CONSIDERABLY OVER A MILLION STERLING SO CONSCIOUS WAS
THE MANAGER OF THE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH DEVOLVED UPON HIM IN
CONSEQUENCE OF THE GREAT INTERESTS AT STAKE THAT SAFES OF THE VERY
LATEST CONSTRUCTION HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED AND AN ARMED WATCHMAN HAS
BEEN LEFT DAY AND NIGHT IN THE BUILDING IT APPEARS THAT LAST WEEK A
NEW CLERK NAMED HALL PYCROFT WAS ENGAGED BY THE FIRM THIS PERSON
APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN NONE OTHER THAT BEDDINGTON THE FAMOUS FORGER
AND CRACKSMAN WHO WITH HIS BROTHER HAD ONLY RECENTLY EMERGED FROM
A FIVE YEARS SPELL OF PENAL SERVITUDE BY SOME MEANS WHICH ARE NOT
YET CLEAR HE SUCCEEDED IN WINNING UNDER A FALSE NAME THIS OFFICIAL
POSITION IN THE OFFICE WHICH HE UTILIZED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MOULDING
OF VARIOUS LOCKS AND A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THE POSITION OF THE
STRONG ROOM AND THE SAFES
IT IS CUSTOMARY AT MAWSONS FOR THE CLERKS TO LEAVE AT MIDDAY ON
SATURDAY SERGEANT TUSON OF THE CITY POLICE WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISED
THEREFORE TO SEE A GENTLEMAN WITH A CARPET BAG COME DOWN THE STEPS AT
TWENTY MINUTES PAST ONE HIS SUSPICIONS BEING AROUSED THE SERGEANT
FOLLOWED THE MAN AND WITH THE AID OF CONSTABLE POLLACK SUCCEEDED
AFTER A MOST DESPERATE RESISTANCE IN ARRESTING HIM IT WAS AT ONCE
CLEAR THAT A DARING AND GIGANTIC ROBBERY HAD BEEN COMMITTED NEARLY A
HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS WORTH OF AMERICAN RAILWAY BONDS WITH A
LARGE AMOUNT OF SCRIP IN MINES AND OTHER COMPANIES WAS DISCOVERED IN
THE BAG ON EXAMINING THE PREMISES THE BODY OF THE UNFORTUNATE
WATCHMAN WAS FOUND DOUBLED UP AND THRUST INTO THE LARGEST OF THE
SAFES WHERE IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED UNTIL MONDAY MORNING
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE PROMPT ACTION OF SERGEANT TUSON THE MANS
SKULL HAD BEEN SHATTERED BY A BLOW FROM A POKER DELIVERED FROM
BEHIND THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT BEDDINGTON HAD OBTAINED ENTRANCE
BY PRETENDING THAT HE HAD LEFT SOMETHING BEHIND HIM AND HAVING
MURDERED THE WATCHMAN RAPIDLY RIFLED THE LARGE SAFE AND THEN MADE
OFF WITH HIS BOOTY HIS BROTHER WHO USUALLY WORKS WITH HIM HAS NOT
APPEARED IN THIS JOB AS FAR AS CAN AT PRESENT BE ASCERTAINED
ALTHOUGH THE POLICE ARE MAKING ENERGETIC INQUIRIES AS TO HIS
WHEREABOUTS
WELL WE MAY SAVE THE POLICE SOME LITTLE TROUBLE IN THAT DIRECTION
SAID HOLMES GLANCING AT THE HAGGARD FIGURE HUDDLED UP BY THE WINDOW
HUMAN NATURE IS A STRANGE MIXTURE WATSON YOU SEE THAT EVEN A
VILLAIN AND MURDERER CAN INSPIRE SUCH AFFECTION THAT HIS BROTHER
TURNS TO SUICIDE WHEN HE LEARNS THAT HIS NECK IS FORFEITED HOWEVER
WE HAVE NO CHOICE AS TO OUR ACTION THE DOCTOR AND I WILL REMAIN ON
GUARD MR PYCROFT IF YOU WILL HAVE THE KINDNESS TO STEP OUT FOR THE
POLICE
THE GLORIA SCOTT
I HAVE SOME PAPERS HERE SAID MY FRIEND SHERLOCK HOLMES AS WE SAT
ONE WINTERS NIGHT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FIRE WHICH I REALLY THINK
WATSON THAT IT WOULD BE WORTH YOUR WHILE TO GLANCE OVER THESE ARE
THE DOCUMENTS IN THE EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT AND THIS
IS THE MESSAGE WHICH STRUCK JUSTICE OF THE PEACE TREVOR DEAD WITH
HORROR WHEN HE READ IT
HE HAD PICKED FROM A DRAWER A LITTLE TARNISHED CYLINDER AND UNDOING
THE TAPE HE HANDED ME A SHORT NOTE SCRAWLED UPON A HALFSHEET OF
SLATE GRAYPAPER
THE SUPPLY OF GAME FOR LONDON IS GOING STEADILY UP IT RAN
HEADKEEPER HUDSON WE BELIEVE HAS BEEN NOW TOLD TO RECEIVE ALL
ORDERS FOR FLYPAPER AND FOR PRESERVATION OF YOUR HENPHEASANTS
LIFE
AS I GLANCED UP FROM READING THIS ENIGMATICAL MESSAGE I SAW HOLMES
CHUCKLING AT THE EXPRESSION UPON MY FACE
YOU LOOK A LITTLE BEWILDERED SAID HE
I CANNOT SEE HOW SUCH A MESSAGE AS THIS COULD INSPIRE HORROR IT
SEEMS TO ME TO BE RATHER GROTESQUE THAN OTHERWISE
VERY LIKELY YET THE FACT REMAINS THAT THE READER WHO WAS A FINE
ROBUST OLD MAN WAS KNOCKED CLEAN DOWN BY IT AS IF IT HAD BEEN THE
BUTT END OF A PISTOL
YOU AROUSE MY CURIOSITY SAID I BUT WHY DID YOU SAY JUST NOW THAT
THERE WERE VERY PARTICULAR REASONS WHY I SHOULD STUDY THIS CASE
BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST IN WHICH I WAS EVER ENGAGED
I HAD OFTEN ENDEAVORED TO ELICIT FROM MY COMPANION WHAT HAD FIRST
TURNED HIS MIND IN THE DIRECTION OF CRIMINAL RESEARCH BUT HAD NEVER
CAUGHT HIM BEFORE IN A COMMUNICATIVE HUMOR NOW HE SAT FORWARD IN HIS
ARMCHAIR AND SPREAD OUT THE DOCUMENTS UPON HIS KNEES THEN HE LIT
HIS PIPE AND SAT FOR SOME TIME SMOKING AND TURNING THEM OVER
YOU NEVER HEARD ME TALK OF VICTOR TREVOR HE ASKED HE WAS THE
ONLY FRIEND I MADE DURING THE TWO YEARS I WAS AT COLLEGE I WAS NEVER
A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW WATSON ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY
ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT SO THAT I
NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR BAR FENCING AND BOXING I
HAD FEW ATHLETIC TASTES AND THEN MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT
FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT
AT ALL TREVOR WAS THE ONLY MAN I KNEW AND THAT ONLY THROUGH THE
ACCIDENT OF HIS BULL TERRIER FREEZING ON TO MY ANKLE ONE MORNING AS I
WENT DOWN TO CHAPEL
IT WAS A PROSAIC WAY OF FORMING A FRIENDSHIP BUT IT WAS EFFECTIVE
I WAS LAID BY THE HEELS FOR TEN DAYS BUT TREVOR USED TO COME IN TO
INQUIRE AFTER ME AT FIRST IT WAS ONLY A MINUTES CHAT BUT SOON HIS
VISITS LENGTHENED AND BEFORE THE END OF THE TERM WE WERE CLOSE
FRIENDS HE WAS A HEARTY FULLBLOODED FELLOW FULL OF SPIRITS AND
ENERGY THE VERY OPPOSITE TO ME IN MOST RESPECTS BUT WE HAD SOME
SUBJECTS IN COMMON AND IT WAS A BOND OF UNION WHEN I FOUND THAT HE
WAS AS FRIENDLESS AS I FINALLY HE INVITED ME DOWN TO HIS FATHERS
PLACE AT DONNITHORPE IN NORFOLK AND I ACCEPTED HIS HOSPITALITY FOR
A MONTH OF THE LONG VACATION
OLD TREVOR WAS EVIDENTLY A MAN OF SOME WEALTH AND CONSIDERATION A
JP AND A LANDED PROPRIETOR DONNITHORPE IS A LITTLE HAMLET JUST TO
THE NORTH OF LANGMERE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE BROADS THE HOUSE WAS AN
OLDFASHIONED WIDESPREAD OAKBEAMED BRICK BUILDING WITH A FINE
LIMELINED AVENUE LEADING UP TO IT THERE WAS EXCELLENT WILDDUCK
SHOOTING IN THE FENS REMARKABLY GOOD FISHING A SMALL BUT SELECT
LIBRARY TAKEN OVER AS I UNDERSTOOD FROM A FORMER OCCUPANT AND A
TOLERABLE COOK SO THAT HE WOULD BE A FASTIDIOUS MAN WHO COULD NOT
PUT IN A PLEASANT MONTH THERE
TREVOR SENIOR WAS A WIDOWER AND MY FRIEND HIS ONLY SON
THERE HAD BEEN A DAUGHTER I HEARD BUT SHE HAD DIED OF DIPHTHERIA
WHILE ON A VISIT TO BIRMINGHAM THE FATHER INTERESTED ME EXTREMELY
HE WAS A MAN OF LITTLE CULTURE BUT WITH A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF
RUDE STRENGTH BOTH PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY HE KNEW HARDLY ANY
BOOKS BUT HE HAD TRAVELED FAR HAD SEEN MUCH OF THE WORLD AND HAD
REMEMBERED ALL THAT HE HAD LEARNED IN PERSON HE WAS A THICKSET
BURLY MAN WITH A SHOCK OF GRIZZLED HAIR A BROWN WEATHERBEATEN
FACE AND BLUE EYES WHICH WERE KEEN TO THE VERGE OF FIERCENESS YET
HE HAD A REPUTATION FOR KINDNESS AND CHARITY ON THE COUNTRYSIDE AND
WAS NOTED FOR THE LENIENCY OF HIS SENTENCES FROM THE BENCH
ONE EVENING SHORTLY AFTER MY ARRIVAL WE WERE SITTING OVER A GLASS
OF PORT AFTER DINNER WHEN YOUNG TREVOR BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT THOSE
HABITS OF OBSERVATION AND INFERENCE WHICH I HAD ALREADY FORMED INTO A
SYSTEM ALTHOUGH I HAD NOT YET APPRECIATED THE PART WHICH THEY WERE
TO PLAY IN MY LIFE THE OLD MAN EVIDENTLY THOUGHT THAT HIS SON WAS
EXAGGERATING IN HIS DESCRIPTION OF ONE OR TWO TRIVIAL FEATS WHICH I
HAD PERFORMED
COME NOW MR HOLMES SAID HE LAUGHING GOODHUMOREDLY IM AN
EXCELLENT SUBJECT IF YOU CAN DEDUCE ANYTHING FROM ME
I FEAR THERE IS NOT VERY MUCH I ANSWERED I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT
YOU HAVE GONE ABOUT IN FEAR OF SOME PERSONAL ATTACK WITHIN THE LAST
TWELVE MONTHS
THE LAUGH FADED FROM HIS LIPS AND HE STARED AT ME IN GREAT
SURPRISE
WELL THATS TRUE ENOUGH SAID HE YOU KNOW VICTOR TURNING TO
HIS SON WHEN WE BROKE UP THAT POACHING GANG THEY SWORE TO KNIFE US
AND SIR EDWARD HOLLY HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ATTACKED IVE ALWAYS BEEN ON
MY GUARD SINCE THEN THOUGH I HAVE NO IDEA HOW YOU KNOW IT
YOU HAVE A VERY HANDSOME STICK I ANSWERED BY THE INSCRIPTION I
OBSERVED THAT YOU HAD NOT HAD IT MORE THAN A YEAR BUT YOU HAVE TAKEN
SOME PAINS TO BORE THE HEAD OF IT AND POUR MELTED LEAD INTO THE HOLE
SO AS TO MAKE IT A FORMIDABLE WEAPON I ARGUED THAT YOU WOULD NOT
TAKE SUCH PRECAUTIONS UNLESS YOU HAD SOME DANGER TO FEAR
ANYTHING ELSE HE ASKED SMILING
YOU HAVE BOXED A GOOD DEAL IN YOUR YOUTH
RIGHT AGAIN HOW DID YOU KNOW IT IS MY NOSE KNOCKED A LITTLE OUT
OF THE STRAIGHT
NO SAID I IT IS YOUR EARS THEY HAVE THE PECULIAR FLATTENING
AND THICKENING WHICH MARKS THE BOXING MAN
ANYTHING ELSE
YOU HAVE DONE A GOOD DEAL OF DIGGING BY YOUR CALLOSITIES
MADE ALL MY MONEY AT THE GOLD FIELDS
YOU HAVE BEEN IN NEW ZEALAND
RIGHT AGAIN
YOU HAVE VISITED JAPAN
QUITE TRUE
AND YOU HAVE BEEN MOST INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH SOME ONE WHOSE
INITIALS WERE J A AND WHOM YOU AFTERWARDS WERE EAGER TO ENTIRELY
FORGET
MR TREVOR STOOD SLOWLY UP FIXED HIS LARGE BLUE EYES UPON ME WITH A
STRANGE WILD STARE AND THEN PITCHED FORWARD WITH HIS FACE AMONG THE
NUTSHELLS WHICH STREWED THE CLOTH IN A DEAD FAINT
YOU CAN IMAGINE WATSON HOW SHOCKED BOTH HIS SON AND I WERE HIS
ATTACK DID NOT LAST LONG HOWEVER FOR WHEN WE UNDID HIS COLLAR AND
SPRINKLED THE WATER FROM ONE OF THE FINGERGLASSES OVER HIS FACE HE
GAVE A GASP OR TWO AND SAT UP
AH BOYS SAID HE FORCING A SMILE I HOPE I HAVENT FRIGHTENED
YOU STRONG AS I LOOK THERE IS A WEAK PLACE IN MY HEART AND IT DOES
NOT TAKE MUCH TO KNOCK ME OVER I DONT KNOW HOW YOU MANAGE THIS MR
HOLMES BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALL THE DETECTIVES OF FACT AND OF
FANCY WOULD BE CHILDREN IN YOUR HANDS THATS YOUR LINE OF LIFE SIR
AND YOU MAY TAKE THE WORD OF A MAN WHO HAS SEEN SOMETHING OF THE
WORLD
AND THAT RECOMMENDATION WITH THE EXAGGERATED ESTIMATE OF MY ABILITY
WITH WHICH HE PREFACED IT WAS IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME WATSON THE
VERY FIRST THING WHICH EVER MADE ME FEEL THAT A PROFESSION MIGHT BE
MADE OUT OF WHAT HAD UP TO THAT TIME BEEN THE MEREST HOBBY AT THE
MOMENT HOWEVER I WAS TOO MUCH CONCERNED AT THE SUDDEN ILLNESS OF MY
HOST TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE
I HOPE THAT I HAVE SAID NOTHING TO PAIN YOU SAID I
WELL YOU CERTAINLY TOUCHED UPON RATHER A TENDER POINT MIGHT I ASK
HOW YOU KNOW AND HOW MUCH YOU KNOW HE SPOKE NOW IN A HALFJESTING
FASHION BUT A LOOK OF TERROR STILL LURKED AT THE BACK OF HIS EYES
IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF SAID I WHEN YOU BARED YOUR ARM TO DRAW
THAT FISH INTO THE BOAT I SAW THAT J A HAD BEEN TATTOOED IN THE
BEND OF THE ELBOW THE LETTERS WERE STILL LEGIBLE BUT IT WAS
PERFECTLY CLEAR FROM THEIR BLURRED APPEARANCE AND FROM THE STAINING
OF THE SKIN ROUND THEM THAT EFFORTS HAD BEEN MADE TO OBLITERATE
THEM IT WAS OBVIOUS THEN THAT THOSE INITIALS HAD ONCE BEEN VERY
FAMILIAR TO YOU AND THAT YOU HAD AFTERWARDS WISHED TO FORGET THEM
WHAT AN EYE YOU HAVE HE CRIED WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF IT IS JUST
AS YOU SAY BUT WE WONT TALK OF IT OF ALL GHOSTS THE GHOSTS OF OUR
OLD LOVERS ARE THE WORST COME INTO THE BILLIARDROOM AND HAVE A
QUIET CIGAR
FROM THAT DAY AMID ALL HIS CORDIALITY THERE WAS ALWAYS A TOUCH OF
SUSPICION IN MR TREVORS MANNER TOWARDS ME EVEN HIS SON REMARKED
IT YOUVE GIVEN THE GOVERNOR SUCH A TURN SAID HE THAT HELL
NEVER BE SURE AGAIN OF WHAT YOU KNOW AND WHAT YOU DONT KNOW HE DID
NOT MEAN TO SHOW IT I AM SURE BUT IT WAS SO STRONGLY IN HIS MIND
THAT IT PEEPED OUT AT EVERY ACTION AT LAST I BECAME SO CONVINCED
THAT I WAS CAUSING HIM UNEASINESS THAT I DREW MY VISIT TO A CLOSE ON
THE VERY DAY HOWEVER BEFORE I LEFT AN INCIDENT OCCURRED WHICH
PROVED IN THE SEQUEL TO BE OF IMPORTANCE
WE WERE SITTING OUT UPON THE LAWN ON GARDEN CHAIRS THE THREE OF US
BASKING IN THE SUN AND ADMIRING THE VIEW ACROSS THE BROADS WHEN A
MAID CAME OUT TO SAY THAT THERE WAS A MAN AT THE DOOR WHO WANTED TO
SEE MR TREVOR
WHAT IS HIS NAME ASKED MY HOST
HE WOULD NOT GIVE ANY
WHAT DOES HE WANT THEN
HE SAYS THAT YOU KNOW HIM AND THAT HE ONLY WANTS A MOMENTS
CONVERSATION
SHOW HIM ROUND HERE AN INSTANT AFTERWARDS THERE APPEARED A LITTLE
WIZENED FELLOW WITH A CRINGING MANNER AND A SHAMBLING STYLE OF
WALKING HE WORE AN OPEN JACKET WITH A SPLOTCH OF TAR ON THE SLEEVE
A REDANDBLACK CHECK SHIRT DUNGAREE TROUSERS AND HEAVY BOOTS BADLY
WORN HIS FACE WAS THIN AND BROWN AND CRAFTY WITH A PERPETUAL SMILE
UPON IT WHICH SHOWED AN IRREGULAR LINE OF YELLOW TEETH AND HIS
CRINKLED HANDS WERE HALF CLOSED IN A WAY THAT IS DISTINCTIVE OF
SAILORS AS HE CAME SLOUCHING ACROSS THE LAWN I HEARD MR TREVOR MAKE
A SORT OF HICCOUGHING NOISE IN HIS THROAT AND JUMPING OUT OF HIS
CHAIR HE RAN INTO THE HOUSE HE WAS BACK IN A MOMENT AND I SMELT A
STRONG REEK OF BRANDY AS HE PASSED ME
WELL MY MAN SAID HE WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU
THE SAILOR STOOD LOOKING AT HIM WITH PUCKERED EYES AND WITH THE
SAME LOOSELIPPED SMILE UPON HIS FACE
YOU DONT KNOW ME HE ASKED

SURPRISE

SITUATION
THANK YOU SIR SAID THE SEAMAN TOUCHING HIS FORELOCK IM JUST

AH CRIED TREVOR YOU KNOW WHERE MR BEDDOES IS
BLESS YOU SIR I KNOW WHERE ALL MY OLD FRIENDS ARE SAID THE
FELLOW WITH A SINISTER SMILE AND HE SLOUCHED OFF AFTER THE MAID TO
THE KITCHEN MR TREVOR MUMBLED SOMETHING TO US ABOUT HAVING BEEN
SHIPMATE WITH THE MAN WHEN HE WAS GOING BACK TO THE DIGGINGS AND
THEN LEAVING US ON THE LAWN HE WENT INDOORS AN HOUR LATER WHEN WE
ENTERED THE HOUSE WE FOUND HIM STRETCHED DEAD DRUNK UPON THE
DININGROOM SOFA THE WHOLE INCIDENT LEFT A MOST UGLY IMPRESSION UPON
MY MIND AND I WAS NOT SORRY NEXT DAY TO LEAVE DONNITHORPE BEHIND ME
FOR I FELT THAT MY PRESENCE MUST BE A SOURCE OF EMBARRASSMENT TO MY
FRIEND
ALL THIS OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST MONTH OF THE LONG VACATION I
WENT UP TO MY LONDON ROOMS WHERE I SPENT SEVEN WEEKS WORKING OUT A
FEW EXPERIMENTS IN ORGANIC CHEMISTRY ONE DAY HOWEVER WHEN THE
AUTUMN WAS FAR ADVANCED AND THE VACATION DRAWING TO A CLOSE I
RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM MY FRIEND IMPLORING ME TO RETURN TO
DONNITHORPE AND SAYING THAT HE WAS IN GREAT NEED OF MY ADVICE AND
ASSISTANCE OF COURSE I DROPPED EVERYTHING AND SET OUT FOR THE NORTH
ONCE MORE
HE MET ME WITH THE DOGCART AT THE STATION AND I SAW AT A GLANCE
THAT THE LAST TWO MONTHS HAD BEEN VERY TRYING ONES FOR HIM HE HAD
GROWN THIN AND CAREWORN AND HAD LOST THE LOUD CHEERY MANNER FOR
WHICH HE HAD BEEN REMARKABLE
THE GOVERNOR IS DYING WERE THE FIRST WORDS HE SAID
IMPOSSIBLE I CRIED WHAT IS THE MATTER
APOPLEXY NERVOUS SHOCK HES BEEN ON THE VERGE ALL DAY I DOUBT IF
WE SHALL FIND HIM ALIVE
I WAS AS YOU MAY THINK WATSON HORRIFIED AT THIS UNEXPECTED NEWS
WHAT HAS CAUSED IT I ASKED
AH THAT IS THE POINT JUMP IN AND WE CAN TALK IT OVER WHILE WE
DRIVE YOU REMEMBER THAT FELLOW WHO CAME UPON THE EVENING BEFORE YOU
LEFT US
PERFECTLY
DO YOU KNOW WHO IT WAS THAT WE LET INTO THE HOUSE THAT DAY
I HAVE NO IDEA
IT WAS THE DEVIL HOLMES HE CRIED
I STARED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
YES IT WAS THE DEVIL HIMSELF WE HAVE NOT HAD A PEACEFUL HOUR
SINCENOT ONE THE GOVERNOR HAS NEVER HELD UP HIS HEAD FROM THAT
EVENING AND NOW THE LIFE HAS BEEN CRUSHED OUT OF HIM AND HIS HEART
BROKEN ALL THROUGH THIS ACCURSED HUDSON
WHAT POWER HAD HE THEN
AH THAT IS WHAT I WOULD GIVE SO MUCH TO KNOW THE KINDLY
CHARITABLE GOOD OLD GOVERNORHOW COULD HE HAVE FALLEN INTO THE
CLUTCHES OF SUCH A RUFFIAN BUT I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU HAVE COME
HOLMES I TRUST VERY MUCH TO YOUR JUDGMENT AND DISCRETION AND I KNOW
THAT YOU WILL ADVISE ME FOR THE BEST
WE WERE DASHING ALONG THE SMOOTH WHITE COUNTRY ROAD WITH THE LONG
STRETCH OF THE BROADS IN FRONT OF US GLIMMERING IN THE RED LIGHT OF
THE SETTING SUN FROM A GROVE UPON OUR LEFT I COULD ALREADY SEE THE
HIGH CHIMNEYS AND THE FLAGSTAFF WHICH MARKED THE SQUIRES DWELLING
MY FATHER MADE THE FELLOW GARDENER SAID MY COMPANION AND THEN
AS THAT DID NOT SATISFY HIM HE WAS PROMOTED TO BE BUTLER THE HOUSE
SEEMED TO BE AT HIS MERCY AND HE WANDERED ABOUT AND DID WHAT HE
CHOSE IN IT THE MAIDS COMPLAINED OF HIS DRUNKEN HABITS AND HIS VILE
LANGUAGE THE DAD RAISED THEIR WAGES ALL ROUND TO RECOMPENSE THEM FOR
THE ANNOYANCE THE FELLOW WOULD TAKE THE BOAT AND MY FATHERS BEST
GUN AND TREAT HIMSELF TO LITTLE SHOOTING TRIPS AND ALL THIS WITH
SUCH A SNEERING LEERING INSOLENT FACE THAT I WOULD HAVE KNOCKED HIM
DOWN TWENTY TIMES OVER IF HE HAD BEEN A MAN OF MY OWN AGE I TELL
YOU HOLMES I HAVE HAD TO KEEP A TIGHT HOLD UPON MYSELF ALL THIS
TIME AND NOW I AM ASKING MYSELF WHETHER IF I HAD LET MYSELF GO A
LITTLE MORE I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A WISER MAN
WELL MATTERS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE WITH US AND THIS ANIMAL
HUDSON BECAME MORE AND MORE INTRUSIVE UNTIL AT LAST ON MAKING SOME
INSOLENT REPLY TO MY FATHER IN MY PRESENCE ONE DAY I TOOK HIM BY THE
SHOULDERS AND TURNED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM HE SLUNK AWAY WITH A LIVID
FACE AND TWO VENOMOUS EYES WHICH UTTERED MORE THREATS THAN HIS TONGUE
COULD DO I DONT KNOW WHAT PASSED BETWEEN THE POOR DAD AND HIM AFTER
THAT BUT THE DAD CAME TO ME NEXT DAY AND ASKED ME WHETHER I WOULD
MIND APOLOGIZING TO HUDSON I REFUSED AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND ASKED
MY FATHER HOW HE COULD ALLOW SUCH A WRETCH TO TAKE SUCH LIBERTIES
WITH HIMSELF AND HIS HOUSEHOLD
AH MY BOY SAID HE IT IS ALL VERY WELL TO TALK BUT YOU DONT
KNOW HOW I AM PLACED BUT YOU SHALL KNOW VICTOR ILL SEE THAT YOU
SHALL KNOW COME WHAT MAY YOU WOULDNT BELIEVE HARM OF YOUR POOR OLD
FATHER WOULD YOU LAD HE WAS VERY MUCH MOVED AND SHUT HIMSELF UP
IN THE STUDY ALL DAY WHERE I COULD SEE THROUGH THE WINDOW THAT HE
WAS WRITING BUSILY
THAT EVENING THERE CAME WHAT SEEMED TO ME TO BE A GRAND RELEASE
FOR HUDSON TOLD US THAT HE WAS GOING TO LEAVE US HE WALKED INTO THE
DININGROOM AS WE SAT AFTER DINNER AND ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION IN
THE THICK VOICE OF A HALFDRUNKEN MAN
IVE HAD ENOUGH OF NORFOLK SAID HE ILL RUN DOWN TO MR
BEDDOES IN HAMPSHIRE HELL BE AS GLAD TO SEE ME AS YOU WERE I DARE
SAY
YOURE NOT GOING AWAY IN ANY KIND OF SPIRIT HUDSON I HOPE SAID
MY FATHER WITH A TAMENESS WHICH MAD MY BLOOD BOIL
IVE NOT HAD MY POLOGY SAID HE SULKILY GLANCING IN MY
DIRECTION
VICTOR YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE USED THIS WORTHY FELLOW
RATHER ROUGHLY SAID THE DAD TURNING TO ME
ON THE CONTRARY I THINK THAT WE HAVE BOTH SHOWN EXTRAORDINARY
PATIENCE TOWARDS HIM I ANSWERED
OH YOU DO DO YOU HE SNARLS VERY GOOD MATE WELL SEE ABOUT
THAT
HE SLOUCHED OUT OF THE ROOM AND HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LEFT THE
HOUSE LEAVING MY FATHER IN A STATE OF PITIABLE NERVOUSNESS NIGHT
AFTER NIGHT I HEARD HIM PACING HIS ROOM AND IT WAS JUST AS HE WAS
RECOVERING HIS CONFIDENCE THAT THE BLOW DID AT LAST FALL
AND HOW I ASKED EAGERLY
IN A MOST EXTRAORDINARY FASHION A LETTER ARRIVED FOR MY FATHER
YESTERDAY EVENING BEARING THE FORDINGBRIDGE POSTMARK MY FATHER
READ IT CLAPPED BOTH HIS HANDS TO HIS HEAD AND BEGAN RUNNING ROUND
THE ROOM IN LITTLE CIRCLES LIKE A MAN WHO HAS BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF HIS
SENSES WHEN I AT LAST DREW HIM DOWN ON TO THE SOFA HIS MOUTH AND
EYELIDS WERE ALL PUCKERED ON ONE SIDE AND I SAW THAT HE HAD A
STROKE DR FORDHAM CAME OVER AT ONCE WE PUT HIM TO BED BUT THE
PARALYSIS HAS SPREAD HE HAS SHOWN NO SIGN OF RETURNING
CONSCIOUSNESS AND I THINK THAT WE SHALL HARDLY FIND HIM ALIVE
YOU HORRIFY ME TREVOR I CRIED WHAT THEN COULD HAVE BEEN IN
THIS LETTER TO CAUSE SO DREADFUL A RESULT
NOTHING THERE LIES THE INEXPLICABLE PART OF IT THE MESSAGE WAS
ABSURD AND TRIVIAL AH MY GOD IT IS AS I FEARED
AS HE SPOKE WE CAME ROUND THE CURVE OF THE AVENUE AND SAW IN THE
FADING LIGHT THAT EVERY BLIND IN THE HOUSE HAD BEEN DRAWN DOWN AS WE
DASHED UP TO THE DOOR MY FRIENDS FACE CONVULSED WITH GRIEF A
GENTLEMAN IN BLACK EMERGED FROM IT
WHEN DID IT HAPPEN DOCTOR ASKED TREVOR
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU LEFT
DID HE RECOVER CONSCIOUSNESS
FOR AN INSTANT BEFORE THE END
ANY MESSAGE FOR ME
ONLY THAT THE PAPERS WERE IN THE BACK DRAWER OF THE JAPANESE
CABINET
MY FRIEND ASCENDED WITH THE DOCTOR TO THE CHAMBER OF DEATH WHILE I
REMAINED IN THE STUDY TURNING THE WHOLE MATTER OVER AND OVER IN MY
HEAD AND FEELING AS SOMBRE AS EVER I HAD DONE IN MY LIFE WHAT WAS
THE PAST OF THIS TREVOR PUGILIST TRAVELER AND GOLDDIGGER AND HOW
HAD HE PLACED HIMSELF IN THE POWER OF THIS ACIDFACED SEAMAN WHY
TOO SHOULD HE FAINT AT AN ALLUSION TO THE HALFEFFACED INITIALS UPON
HIS ARM AND DIE OF FRIGHT WHEN HE HAD A LETTER FROM FORDINGHAM THEN I
REMEMBERED THAT FORDINGHAM WAS IN HAMPSHIRE AND THAT THIS MR
BEDDOES WHOM THE SEAMAN HAD GONE TO VISIT AND PRESUMABLY TO
BLACKMAIL HAD ALSO BEEN MENTIONED AS LIVING IN HAMPSHIRE THE
LETTER THEN MIGHT EITHER COME FROM HUDSON THE SEAMAN SAYING THAT
HE HAD BETRAYED THE GUILTY SECRET WHICH APPEARED TO EXIST OR IT
MIGHT COME FROM BEDDOES WARNING AN OLD CONFEDERATE THAT SUCH A
BETRAYAL WAS IMMINENT SO FAR IT SEEMED CLEAR ENOUGH BUT THEN HOW
COULD THIS LETTER BE TRIVIAL AND GROTESQUE AS DESCRIBED BY THE SON HE
MUST HAVE MISREAD IT IF SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THOSE
INGENIOUS SECRET CODES WHICH MEAN ONE THING WHILE THEY SEEM TO MEAN
ANOTHER I MUST SEE THIS LETTER IF THERE WERE A HIDDEN MEANING IN
IT I WAS CONFIDENT THAT I COULD PLUCK IT FORTH FOR AN HOUR I SAT
PONDERING OVER IT IN THE GLOOM UNTIL AT LAST A WEEPING MAID BROUGHT
IN A LAMP AND CLOSE AT HER HEELS CAME MY FRIEND TREVOR PALE BUT
COMPOSED WITH THESE VERY PAPERS WHICH LIE UPON MY KNEE HELD IN HIS
GRASP HE SAT DOWN OPPOSITE TO ME DREW THE LAMP TO THE EDGE OF THE
TABLE AND HANDED ME A SHORT NOTE SCRIBBLED AS YOU SEE UPON A
SINGLE SHEET OF GRAY PAPER THE SUPPLY OF GAME FOR LONDON IS GOING
STEADILY UP IT RAN HEADKEEPER HUDSON WE BELIEVE HAS BEEN NOW
TOLD TO RECEIVE ALL ORDERS FOR FLYPAPER AND FOR PRESERVATION OF YOUR
HENPHEASANTS LIFE
I DARE SAY MY FACE LOOKED AS BEWILDERED AS YOURS DID JUST NOW WHEN
FIRST I READ THIS MESSAGE THEN I REREAD IT VERY CAREFULLY IT WAS
EVIDENTLY AS I HAD THOUGHT AND SOME SECRET MEANING MUST LIE BURIED
IN THIS STRANGE COMBINATION OF WORDS OR COULD IT BE THAT THERE WAS A
PREARRANGED SIGNIFICANCE TO SUCH PHRASES AS FLYPAPER AND
HENPHEASANT SUCH A MEANING WOULD BE ARBITRARY AND COULD NOT BE
DEDUCED IN ANY WAY AND YET I WAS LOATH TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS THE
CASE AND THE PRESENCE OF THE WORD HUDSON SEEMED TO SHOW THAT THE
SUBJECT OF THE MESSAGE WAS AS I HAD GUESSED AND THAT IT WAS FROM
BEDDOES RATHER THAN THE SAILOR I TRIED IT BACKWARDS BUT THE
COMBINATION LIFE PHEASANTS HEN WAS NOT ENCOURAGING THEN I TRIED
ALTERNATE WORDS BUT NEITHER THE OF FOR NOR SUPPLY GAME LONDON
PROMISED TO THROW ANY LIGHT UPON IT
AND THEN IN AN INSTANT THE KEY OF THE RIDDLE WAS IN MY HANDS AND I
SAW THAT EVERY THIRD WORD BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST WOULD GIVE A
MESSAGE WHICH MIGHT WELL DRIVE OLD TREVOR TO DESPAIR
IT WAS SHORT AND TERSE THE WARNING AS I NOW READ IT TO MY
COMPANION
THE GAME IS UP HUDSON HAS TOLD ALL FLY FOR YOUR LIFE
VICTOR TREVOR SANK HIS FACE INTO HIS SHAKING HANDS IT MUST BE
THAT I SUPPOSE SAID HE THIS IS WORSE THAN DEATH FOR IT MEANS
DISGRACE AS WELL BUT WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THESE HEADKEEPERS AND
HENPHEASANTS
IT MEANS NOTHING TO THE MESSAGE BUT IT MIGHT MEAN A GOOD DEAL TO
US IF WE HAD NO OTHER MEANS OF DISCOVERING THE SENDER YOU SEE THAT
HE HAS BEGUN BY WRITING THE GAME IS AND SO ON AFTERWARDS
HE HAD TO FULFILL THE PREARRANGED CIPHER TO FILL IN ANY TWO WORDS
IN EACH SPACE HE WOULD NATURALLY USE THE FIRST WORDS WHICH CAME TO
HIS MIND AND IF THERE WERE SO MANY WHICH REFERRED TO SPORT AMONG
THEM YOU MAY BE TOLERABLY SURE THAT HE IS EITHER AN ARDENT SHOT OR
INTERESTED IN BREEDING DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF THIS BEDDOES
WHY NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT SAID HE I REMEMBER THAT MY POOR
FATHER USED TO HAVE AN INVITATION FROM HIM TO SHOOT OVER HIS
PRESERVES EVERY AUTUMN
THEN IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY FROM HIM THAT THE NOTE COMES SAID I IT
ONLY REMAINS FOR US TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS SECRET WAS WHICH THE SAILOR
HUDSON SEEMS TO HAVE HELD OVER THE HEADS OF THESE TWO WEALTHY AND
RESPECTED MEN
ALAS HOLMES I FEAR THAT IT IS ONE OF SIN AND SHAME CRIED MY
FRIEND BUT FROM YOU I SHALL HAVE NO SECRETS HERE IS THE STATEMENT
WHICH WAS DRAWN UP BY MY FATHER WHEN HE KNEW THAT THE DANGER FROM
HUDSON HAD BECOME IMMINENT I FOUND IT IN THE JAPANESE CABINET AS HE
TOLD THE DOCTOR TAKE IT AND READ IT TO ME FOR I HAVE NEITHER THE
STRENGTH NOR THE COURAGE TO DO IT MYSELF
THESE ARE THE VERY PAPERS WATSON WHICH HE HANDED TO ME AND I WILL
READ THEM TO YOU AS I READ THEM IN THE OLD STUDY THAT NIGHT TO HIM
THEY ARE ENDORSED OUTSIDE AS YOU SEE SOME PARTICULARS OF THE
VOYAGE OF THE BARK GLORIA SCOTT FROM HER LEAVING FALMOUTH ON THE TH
OCTOBER TO HER DESTRUCTION IN N LAT W LONG ON NOV TH IT IS IN THE FORM
OF A LETTER AND RUNS IN THIS
WAY
MY DEAR DEAR SON NOW THAT APPROACHING DISGRACE BEGINS TO DARKEN
THE CLOSING YEARS OF MY LIFE I CAN WRITE WITH ALL TRUTH AND HONESTY
THAT IT IS NOT THE TERROR OF THE LAW IT IS NOT THE LOSS OF MY
POSITION IN THE COUNTY NOR IS IT MY FALL IN THE EYES OF ALL WHO HAVE
KNOWN ME WHICH CUTS ME TO THE HEART BUT IT IS THE THOUGHT THAT YOU
SHOULD COME TO BLUSH FOR MEYOU WHO LOVE ME AND WHO HAVE SELDOM I
HOPE HAD REASON TO DO OTHER THAN RESPECT ME BUT IF THE BLOW FALLS
WHICH IS FOREVER HANGING OVER ME THEN I SHOULD WISH YOU TO READ
THIS THAT YOU MAY KNOW STRAIGHT FROM ME HOW FAR I HAVE BEEN TO
BLAME ON THE OTHER HAND IF ALL SHOULD GO WELL WHICH MAY KIND GOD
ALMIGHTY GRANT THEN IF BY ANY CHANCE THIS PAPER SHOULD BE STILL
UNDESTROYED AND SHOULD FALL INTO YOUR HANDS I CONJURE YOU BY ALL
YOU HOLD SACRED BY THE MEMORY OF YOUR DEAR MOTHER AND BY THE LOVE
WHICH HAD BEEN BETWEEN US TO HURL IT INTO THE FIRE AND TO NEVER GIVE
ONE THOUGHT TO IT AGAIN
IF THEN YOUR EYE GOES ONTO READ THIS LINE I KNOW THAT I SHALL
ALREADY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND DRAGGED FROM MY HOME OR AS IS MORE
LIKELY FOR YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IS WEAK BY LYING WITH MY TONGUE
SEALED FOREVER IN DEATH IN EITHER CASE THE TIME FOR SUPPRESSION IS
PAST AND EVERY WORD WHICH I TELL YOU IS THE NAKED TRUTH AND THIS I
SWEAR AS I HOPE FOR MERCY
MY NAME DEAR LAD IS NOT TREVOR I WAS JAMES ARMITAGE IN MY
YOUNGER DAYS AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND NOW THE SHOCK THAT IT WAS TO ME
A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN YOUR COLLEGE FRIEND ADDRESSED ME IN WORDS WHICH
SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT HE HAD SURPRISED MY SECRET AS ARMITAGE IT WAS
THAT I ENTERED A LONDON BANKINGHOUSE AND AS ARMITAGE I WAS
CONVICTED OF BREAKING MY COUNTRYS LAWS AND WAS SENTENCED TO
TRANSPORTATION DO NOT THINK VERY HARSHLY OF ME LADDIE IT WAS A
DEBT OF HONOR SO CALLED WHICH I HAD TO PAY AND I USED MONEY WHICH
WAS NOT MY OWN TO DO IT IN THE CERTAINTY THAT I COULD REPLACE IT
BEFORE THERE COULD BE ANY POSSIBILITY OF ITS BEING MISSED BUT THE
MOST DREADFUL ILLLUCK PURSUED ME THE MONEY WHICH I HAD RECKONED
UPON NEVER CAME TO HAND AND A PREMATURE EXAMINATION OF ACCOUNTS
EXPOSED MY DEFICIT THE CASE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEALT LENIENTLY WITH
BUT THE LAWS WERE MORE HARSHLY ADMINISTERED THIRTY YEARS AGO THAN
NOW AND ON MY TWENTYTHIRD BIRTHDAY I FOUND MYSELF CHAINED AS A
FELON WITH THIRTYSEVEN OTHER CONVICTS IN TWEENDECKS OF THE BARK
GLORIA SCOTT BOUND FOR AUSTRALIA
IT WAS THE YEAR WHEN THE CRIMEAN WAR WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AND THE
OLD CONVICT SHIPS HAD BEEN LARGELY USED AS TRANSPORTS IN THE BLACK
SEA THE GOVERNMENT WAS COMPELLED THEREFORE TO USE SMALLER AND LESS
SUITABLE VESSELS FOR SENDING OUT THEIR PRISONERS THE GLORIA SCOTT
HAD BEEN IN THE CHINESE TEATRADE BUT SHE WAS AN OLDFASHIONED
HEAVYBOWED BROADBEAMED CRAFT AND THE NEW CLIPPERS HAD CUT HER
OUT SHE WAS A FIVEHUNDREDTON BOAT AND BESIDES HER THIRTYEIGHT
JAILBIRDS SHE CARRIED TWENTYSIX OF A CREW EIGHTEEN SOLDIERS A
CAPTAIN THREE MATES A DOCTOR A CHAPLAIN AND FOUR WARDERS NEARLY
A HUNDRED SOULS WERE IN HER ALL TOLD WHEN WE SET SAIL FROM
FALMOUTH
THE PARTITIONS BETWEEN THE CELLS OF THE CONVICTS INSTEAD OF BEING
OF THICK OAK AS IS USUAL IN CONVICTSHIPS WERE QUITE THIN AND
FRAIL THE MAN NEXT TO ME UPON THE AFT SIDE WAS ONE WHOM I HAD
PARTICULARLY NOTICED WHEN WE WERE LED DOWN THE QUAY HE WAS A YOUNG
MAN WITH A CLEAR HAIRLESS FACE A LONG THIN NOSE AND RATHER
NUTCRACKER JAWS HE CARRIED HIS HEAD VERY JAUNTILY IN THE AIR HAD A
SWAGGERING STYLE OF WALKING AND WAS ABOVE ALL ELSE REMARKABLE FOR
HIS EXTRAORDINARY HEIGHT I DONT THINK ANY OF OUR HEADS WOULD HAVE
COME UP TO HIS SHOULDER AND I AM SURE THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE
MEASURED LESS THAN SIX AND A HALF FEET IT WAS STRANGE AMONG SO MANY
SAD AND WEARY FACES TO SEE ONE WHICH WAS FULL OF ENERGY AND
RESOLUTION THE SIGHT OF IT WAS TO ME LIKE A FIRE IN A SNOWSTORM I
WAS GLAD THEN TO FIND THAT HE WAS MY NEIGHBOR AND GLADDER STILL
WHEN IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT I HEARD A WHISPER CLOSE TO MY EAR
AND FOUND THAT HE HAD MANAGED TO CUT AN OPENING IN THE BOARD WHICH
SEPARATED US
HULLO CHUMMY SAID HE WHATS YOUR NAME AND WHAT ARE YOU HERE
FOR
I ANSWERED HIM AND ASKED IN TURN WHO I WAS TALKING WITH
IM JACK PRENDERGAST SAID HE AND BY GOD YOULL LEARN TO BLESS
MY NAME BEFORE YOUVE DONE WITH ME
I REMEMBERED HEARING OF HIS CASE FOR IT WAS ONE WHICH HAD MADE AN
IMMENSE SENSATION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SOME TIME BEFORE MY OWN
ARREST HE WAS A MAN OF GOOD FAMILY AND OF GREAT ABILITY BUT OF
INCURABLY VICIOUS HABITS WHO HAD BY AN INGENIOUS SYSTEM OF FRAUD
OBTAINED HUGE SUMS OF MONEY FROM THE LEADING LONDON MERCHANTS
HA HA YOU REMEMBER MY CASE SAID HE PROUDLY
VERY WELL INDEED
THEN MAYBE YOU REMEMBER SOMETHING QUEER ABOUT IT
WHAT WAS THAT THEN
ID HAD NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILLION HADNT I
SO IT WAS SAID
BUT NONE WAS RECOVERED EH
NO
WELL WHERE DYE SUPPOSE THE BALANCE IS HE ASKED
I HAVE NO IDEA SAID I
RIGHT BETWEEN MY FINGER AND THUMB HE CRIED BY GOD IVE GOT
MORE POUNDS TO MY NAME THAN YOUVE HAIRS ON YOUR HEAD AND IF YOUVE
MONEY MY SON AND KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT AND SPREAD IT YOU CAN DO
ANYTHING NOW YOU DONT THINK IT LIKELY THAT A MAN WHO COULD DO
ANYTHING IS GOING TO WEAR HIS BREECHES OUT SITTING IN THE STINKING
HOLD OF A RATGUTTED BEETLERIDDEN MOULDY OLD COFFIN OF A CHIN
CHINA COASTER NO SIR SUCH A MAN WILL LOOK AFTER HIMSELF AND WILL
LOOK AFTER HIS CHUMS YOU MAY LAY TO THAT YOU HOLD ON TO HIM AND
YOU MAY KISS THE BOOK THAT HELL HAUL YOU THROUGH
THAT WAS HIS STYLE OF TALK AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT MEANT
NOTHING BUT AFTER A WHILE WHEN HE HAD TESTED ME AND SWORN ME IN
WITH ALL POSSIBLE SOLEMNITY HE LET ME UNDERSTAND THAT THERE REALLY
WAS A PLOT TO GAIN COMMAND OF THE VESSEL A DOZEN OF THE PRISONERS
HAD HATCHED IT BEFORE THEY CAME ABOARD PRENDERGAST WAS THE LEADER
AND HIS MONEY WAS THE MOTIVE POWER
ID A PARTNER SAID HE A RARE GOOD MAN AS TRUE AS A STOCK TO A
BARREL HES GOT THE DIBBS HE HAS AND WHERE DO YOU THINK HE IS AT
THIS MOMENT WHY HES THE CHAPLAIN OF THIS SHIPTHE CHAPLAIN NO
LESS HE CAME ABOARD WITH A BLACK COAT AND HIS PAPERS RIGHT AND
MONEY ENOUGH IN HIS BOX TO BUY THE THING RIGHT UP FROM KEEL TO
MAINTRUCK THE CREW ARE HIS BODY AND SOUL HE COULD BUY EM AT SO
MUCH A GROSS WITH A CASH DISCOUNT AND HE DID IT BEFORE EVER THEY
SIGNED ON HES GOT TWO OF THE WARDERS AND MERCER THE SECOND MATE
AND HED GET THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF IF HE THOUGHT HIM WORTH IT
WHAT ARE WE TO DO THEN I ASKED
WHAT DO YOU THINK SAID HE WELL MAKE THE COATS OF SOME OF
THESE SOLDIERS REDDER THAN EVER THE TAILOR DID
BUT THEY ARE ARMED SAID I
AND SO SHALL WE BE MY BOY THERES A BRACE OF PISTOLS FOR EVERY
MOTHERS SON OF US AND IF WE CANT CARRY THIS SHIP WITH THE CREW AT
OUR BACK ITS TIME WE WERE ALL SENT TO A YOUNG MISSES
BOARDINGSCHOOL YOU SPEAK TO YOUR MATE UPON THE LEFT TONIGHT AND
SEE IF HE IS TO BE TRUSTED
I DID SO AND FOUND MY OTHER NEIGHBOR TO BE A YOUNG FELLOW IN MUCH
THE SAME POSITION AS MYSELF WHOSE CRIME HAD BEEN FORGERY HIS NAME
WAS EVANS BUT HE AFTERWARDS CHANGED IT LIKE MYSELF AND HE IS NOW A
RICH AND PROSPEROUS MAN IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND HE WAS READY ENOUGH
TO JOIN THE CONSPIRACY AS THE ONLY MEANS OF SAVING OURSELVES AND
BEFORE WE HAD CROSSED THE BAY THERE WERE ONLY TWO OF THE PRISONERS
WHO WERE NOT IN THE SECRET ONE OF THESE WAS OF WEAK MIND AND WE DID
NOT DARE TO TRUST HIM AND THE OTHER WAS SUFFERING FROM JAUNDICE AND
COULD NOT BE OF ANY USE TO US
FROM THE BEGINNING THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING TO PREVENT US FROM
TAKING POSSESSION OF THE SHIP THE CREW WERE A SET OF RUFFIANS
SPECIALLY PICKED FOR THE JOB THE SHAM CHAPLAIN CAME INTO OUR CELLS
TO EXHORT US CARRYING A BLACK BAG SUPPOSED TO BE FULL OF TRACTS
AND SO OFTEN DID HE COME THAT BY THE THIRD DAY WE HAD EACH STOWED
AWAY AT THE FOOT OF OUR BEDS A FILE A BRACE OF PISTOLS A POUND OF
POWDER AND TWENTY SLUGS TWO OF THE WARDERS WERE AGENTS OF
PRENDERGAST AND THE SECOND MATE WAS HIS RIGHTHAND MAN THE CAPTAIN
THE TWO MATES TWO WARDERS LIEUTENANT MARTIN HIS EIGHTEEN SOLDIERS
AND THE DOCTOR WERE ALL THAT WE HAD AGAINST US YET SAFE AS IT WAS
WE DETERMINED TO NEGLECT NO PRECAUTION AND TO MAKE OUR ATTACK
SUDDENLY BY NIGHT IT CAME HOWEVER MORE QUICKLY THAN WE EXPECTED
AND IN THIS WAY
ONE EVENING ABOUT THE THIRD WEEK AFTER OUR START THE DOCTOR HAD
COME DOWN TO SEE ONE OF THE PRISONERS WHO WAS ILL AND PUTTING HIS
HAND DOWN ON THE BOTTOM OF HIS BUNK HE FELT THE OUTLINE OF THE
PISTOLS IF HE HAD BEEN SILENT HE MIGHT HAVE BLOWN THE WHOLE THING
BUT HE WAS A NERVOUS LITTLE CHAP SO HE GAVE A CRY OF SURPRISE AND
TURNED SO PALE THAT THE MAN KNEW WHAT WAS UP IN AN INSTANT AND SEIZED
HIM HE WAS GAGGED BEFORE HE COULD GIVE THE ALARM AND TIED DOWN UPON
THE BED HE HAD UNLOCKED THE DOOR THAT LED TO THE DECK AND WE WERE
THROUGH IT IN A RUSH THE TWO SENTRIES WERE SHOT DOWN AND SO WAS A
CORPORAL WHO CAME RUNNING TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER THERE WERE TWO
MORE SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR OF THE STATEROOM AND THEIR MUSKETS SEEMED
NOT TO BE LOADED FOR THEY NEVER FIRED UPON US AND THEY WERE SHOT
WHILE TRYING TO FIX THEIR BAYONETS THEN WE RUSHED ON INTO THE
CAPTAINS CABIN BUT AS WE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR THERE WAS AN
EXPLOSION FROM WITHIN AND THERE HE LAY WITH HIS BRAINS SMEARED OVER
THE CHART OF THE ATLANTIC WHICH WAS PINNED UPON THE TABLE WHILE THE
CHAPLAIN STOOD WITH A SMOKING PISTOL IN HIS HAND AT HIS ELBOW THE
TWO MATES HAD BOTH BEEN SEIZED BY THE CREW AND THE WHOLE BUSINESS
SEEMED TO BE SETTLED
THE STATEROOM WAS NEXT THE CABIN AND WE FLOCKED IN THERE AND
FLOPPED DOWN ON THE SETTEES ALL SPEAKING TOGETHER FOR WE WERE JUST
MAD WITH THE FEELING THAT WE WERE FREE ONCE MORE THERE WERE LOCKERS
ALL ROUND AND WILSON THE SHAM CHAPLAIN KNOCKED ONE OF THEM IN AND
PULLED OUT A DOZEN OF BROWN SHERRY WE CRACKED OFF THE NECKS OF THE
BOTTLES POURED THE STUFF OUT INTO TUMBLERS AND WERE JUST TOSSING
THEM OFF WHEN IN AN INSTANT WITHOUT WARNING THERE CAME THE ROAR OF
MUSKETS IN OUR EARS AND THE SALOON WAS SO FULL OF SMOKE THAT WE
COULD NOT SEE ACROSS THE TABLE WHEN IT CLEARED AGAIN THE PLACE WAS A
SHAMBLES WILSON AND EIGHT OTHERS WERE WRIGGLING ON THE TOP OF EACH
OTHER ON THE FLOOR AND THE BLOOD AND THE BROWN SHERRY ON THAT TABLE
TURN ME SICK NOW WHEN I THINK OF IT WE WERE SO COWED BY THE SIGHT
THAT I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THE JOB UP IF HAD NOT BEEN FOR
PRENDERGAST HE BELLOWED LIKE A BULL AND RUSHED FOR THE DOOR WITH ALL
THAT WERE LEFT ALIVE AT HIS HEELS OUT WE RAN AND THERE ON THE POOP
WERE THE LIEUTENENT AND TEN OF HIS MEN THE SWING SKYLIGHTS ABOVE THE
SALOON TABLE HAD BEEN A BIT OPEN AND THEY HAD FIRED ON US THROUGH
THE SLIT WE GOT ON THEM BEFORE THEY COULD LOAD AND THEY STOOD TO
IT LIKE MEN BUT WE HAD THE UPPER HAND OF THEM AND IN FIVE MINUTES
IT WAS ALL OVER MY GOD WAS THERE EVER A SLAUGHTERHOUSE LIKE THAT
SHIP PREDERGAST WAS LIKE A RAGING DEVIL AND HE PICKED THE SOLDIERS
UP AS IF THEY HAD BEEN CHILDREN AND THREW THEM OVERBOARD ALIVE OR
DEAD THERE WAS ONE SERGEANT THAT WAS HORRIBLY WOUNDED AND YET KEPT
ON SWIMMING FOR A SURPRISING TIME UNTIL SOME ONE IN MERCY BLEW OUT
HIS BRAINS WHEN THE FIGHTING WAS OVER THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT OF OUR
ENEMIES EXCEPT JUST THE WARDERS THE MATES AND THE DOCTOR
IT WAS OVER THEM THAT THE GREAT QUARREL AROSE THERE WERE MANY OF
US WHO WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO WIN BACK OUR FREEDOM AND YET WHO HAD NO
WISH TO HAVE MURDER ON OUR SOULS IT WAS ONE THING TO KNOCK THE
SOLDIERS OVER WITH THEIR MUSKETS IN THEIR HANDS AND IT WAS ANOTHER
TO STAND BY WHILE MEN WERE BEING KILLED IN COLD BLOOD EIGHT OF US
FIVE CONVICTS AND THREE SAILORS SAID THAT WE WOULD NOT SEE IT DONE
BUT THERE WAS NO MOVING PREDERGAST AND THOSE WHO WERE WITH HIM OUR
ONLY CHANCE OF SAFETY LAY IN MAKING A CLEAN JOB OF IT SAID HE AND
HE WOULD NOT LEAVE A TONGUE WITH POWER TO WAG IN A WITNESSBOX IT
NEARLY CAME TO OUR SHARING THE FATE OF THE PRISONERS BUT AT LAST HE
SAID THAT IF WE WISHED WE MIGHT TAKE A BOAT AND GO WE JUMPED AT THE
OFFER FOR WE WERE ALREADY SICK OF THESE BLOOKTHIRSTY DOINGS AND WE
SAW THAT THERE WOULD BE WORSE BEFORE IT WAS DONE WE WERE GIVEN A
SUIT OF SAILOR TOGS EACH A BARREL OF WATER TWO CASKS ONE OF JUNK
AND ONE OF BISCUITS AND A COMPASS PRENDERGAST THREW US OVER A
CHART TOLD US THAT WE WERE SHIPWRECKED MARINERS WHOSE SHIP HAD
FOUNDERED IN LAT AND LONG WEST AND THEN CUT THE PAINTER
AND LET US GO
AND NOW I COME TO THE MOST SURPRISING PART OF MY STORY MY DEAR
SON THE SEAMEN HAD HAULED THE FOREYARD ABACK DURING THE RISING BUT
NOW AS WE LEFT THEM THEY BROUGHT IT SQUARE AGAIN AND AS THERE WAS A
LIGHT WIND FROM THE NORTH AND EAST THE BARK BEGAN TO DRAW SLOWLY AWAY
FROM US OUR BOAT LAY RISING AND FALLING UPON THE LONG SMOOTH
ROLLERS AND EVANS AND I WHO WERE THE MOST EDUCATED OF THE PARTY
WERE SITTING IN THE SHEETS WORKING OUT OUR POSITION AND PLANNING WHAT
COAST WE SHOULD MAKE FOR IT WAS A NICE QUESTION FOR THE CAPE DE
VERDS WERE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILES TO THE NORTH OF US AND THE
AFRICAN COAST ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED TO THE EAST ON THE WHOLE AS THE
WIND WAS COMING ROUND TO THE NORTH WE THOUGHT THAT SIERRA LEONE
MIGHT BE BEST AND TURNED OUR HEAD IN THAT DIRECTION THE BARK BEING
AT THAT TIME NEARLY HULL DOWN ON OUR STARBOARD QUARTER SUDDENLY AS
WE LOOKED AT HER WE SAW A DENSE BLACK CLOUD OF SMOKE SHOOT UP FROM
HER WHICH HUNG LIKE A MONSTROUS TREE UPON THE SKY LINE A FEW
SECONDS LATER A ROAR LIKE THUNDER BURST UPON OUR EARS AND AS THE
SMOKE THINNED AWAY THERE WAS NO SIGN LEFT OF THE GLORIA SCOTT IN AN
INSTANT WE SWEPT THE BOATS HEAD ROUND AGAIN AND PULLED WITH ALL OUR
STRENGTH FOR THE PLACE WHERE THE HAZE STILL TRAILING OVER THE WATER
MARKED THE SCENE OF THIS CATASTROPHE
IT WAS A LONG HOUR BEFORE WE REACHED IT AND AT FIRST WE FEARED
THAT WE HAD COME TOO LATE TO SAVE ANY ONE A SPLINTERED BOAT AND A
NUMBER OF CRATES AND FRAGMENTS OF SPARS RISING AND FALLING ON THE
WAVES SHOWED US WHERE THE VESSEL HAD FOUNDERED BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN
OF LIFE AND WE HAD TURNED AWAY IN DESPAIR WHEN WE HEARD A CRY FOR
HELP AND SAW AT SOME DISTANCE A PIECE OF WRECKAGE WITH A MAN LYING
STRETCHED ACROSS IT WHEN WE PULLED HIM ABOARD THE BOAT HE PROVED TO
BE A YOUNG SEAMAN OF THE NAME OF HUDSON WHO WAS SO BURNED AND
EXHAUSTED THAT HE COULD GIVE US NO ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED UNTIL
THE FOLLOWING MORNING
IT SEEMED THAT AFTER WE HAD LEFT PRENDERGAST AND HIS GANG HAD
PROCEEDED TO PUT TO DEATH THE FIVE REMAINING PRISONERS THE TWO
WARDERS HAD BEEN SHOT AND THROWN OVERBOARD AND SO ALSO HAD THE THIRD
MATE PRENDERGAST THEN DESCENDED INTO THE TWEENDECKS AND WITH HIS
OWN HANDS CUT THE THROAT OF THE UNFORTUNATE SURGEON THERE ONLY
REMAINED THE FIRST MATE WHO WAS A BOLD AND ACTIVE MAN WHEN HE SAW
THE CONVICT APPROACHING HIM WITH THE BLOODY KNIFE IN HIS HAND HE
KICKED OFF HIS BONDS WHICH HE HAD SOMEHOW CONTRIVED TO LOOSEN AND
RUSHING DOWN THE DECK HE PLUNGED INTO THE AFTERHOLD A DOZEN
CONVICTS WHO DESCENDED WITH THEIR PISTOLS IN SEARCH OF HIM FOUND
HIM WITH A MATCHBOX IN HIS HAND SEATED BESIDE AN OPEN POWDERBARREL
WHICH WAS ONE OF A HUNDRED CARRIED ON BOARD AND SWEARING THAT HE
WOULD BLOW ALL HANDS UP IF HE WERE IN ANY WAY MOLESTED AN INSTANT
LATER THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED THOUGH HUDSON THOUGHT IT WAS CAUSED BY
THE MISDIRECTED BULLET OF ONE OF THE CONVICTS RATHER THAN THE MATES
MATCH BE THE CAUSE WHAT I MAY IT WAS THE END OF THE GLORIA SCOTT
AND OF THE RABBLE WHO HELD COMMAND OF HER
SUCH IN A FEW WORDS MY DEAR BOY IS THE HISTORY OF THIS TERRIBLE
BUSINESS IN WHICH I WAS INVOLVED NEXT DAY WE WERE PICKED UP BY THE
BRIG HOTSPUR BOUND FOR AUSTRALIA WHOSE CAPTAIN FOUND NO DIFFICULTY
IN BELIEVING THAT WE WERE THE SURVIVORS OF A PASSENGER SHIP WHICH HAD
FOUNDERED THE TRANSPORT SHIP GLORIA SCOTT WAS SET DOWN BY THE
ADMIRALTY AS BEING LOST AT SEA AND NO WORD HAS EVER LEAKED OUT AS TO
HER TRUE FATE AFTER AN EXCELLENT VOYAGE THE HOTSPUR LANDED US AT
SYDNEY WHERE EVANS AND I CHANGED OUR NAMES AND MADE OUR WAY TO THE
DIGGINGS WHERE AMONG THE CROWDS WHO WERE GATHERED FROM ALL NATIONS
WE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN LOSING OUR FORMER IDENTITIES THE REST I NEED
NOT RELATE WE PROSPERED WE TRAVELED WE CAME BACK AS RICH COLONIALS
TO ENGLAND AND WE BOUGHT COUNTRY ESTATES FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS
WE HAVE LED PEACEFUL AND USEFUL LIVES AND WE HOPED THAT OUR PAST WAS
FOREVER BURIED IMAGINE THEN MY FEELINGS WHEN IN THE SEAMAN WHO
CAME TO US I RECOGNIZED INSTANTLY THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN PICKED OFF THE
WRECK HE HAD TRACKED US DOWN SOMEHOW AND HAD SET HIMSELF TO LIVE
UPON OUR FEARS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND NOW HOW IT WAS THAT I STROVE TO
KEEP THE PEACE WITH HIM AND YOU WILL IN SOME MEASURE SYMPATHIZE WITH
ME IN THE FEARS WHICH FILL ME NOW THAT HE HAS GONE FROM ME TO HIS
OTHER VICTIM WITH THREATS UPON HIS TONGUE
UNDERNEATH IS WRITTEN IN A HAND SO SHAKY AS TO BE HARDLY LEGIBLE
BEDDOES WRITES IN CIPHER TO SAY H HAS TOLD ALL SWEET LORD HAVE
MERCY ON OUR SOULS
THAT WAS THE NARRATIVE WHICH I READ THAT NIGHT TO YOUNG TREVOR AND
I THINK WATSON THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS A DRAMATIC ONE
THE GOOD FELLOW WAS HEARTBROKEN AT IT AND WENT OUT TO THE TERAI TEA
PLANTING WHERE I HEAR THAT HE IS DOING WELL AS TO THE SAILOR AND
BEDDOES NEITHER OF THEM WAS EVER HEARD OF AGAIN AFTER THAT DAY ON
WHICH THE LETTER OF WARNING WAS WRITTEN THEY BOTH DISAPPEARED
UTTERLY AND COMPLETELY NO COMPLAINT HAD BEEN LODGED WITH THE POLICE
SO THAT BEDDOES HAD MISTAKEN A THREAT FOR A DEED HUDSON HAD BEEN
SEEN LURKING ABOUT AND IT WAS BELIEVED BY THE POLICE THAT HE HAD
DONE AWAY WITH BEDDOES AND HAD FLED FOR MYSELF I BELIEVE THAT THE
TRUTH WAS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE I THINK THAT IT IS MOST PROBABLE THAT
BEDDOES PUSHED TO DESPERATION AND BELIEVING HIMSELF TO HAVE BEEN
ALREADY BETRAYED HAD REVENGED HIMSELF UPON HUDSON AND HAD FLED FROM
THE COUNTRY WITH AS MUCH MONEY AS HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ON THOSE
ARE THE FACTS OF THE CASE DOCTOR AND IF THEY ARE OF ANY USE TO YOUR
COLLECTION I AM SURE THAT THEY ARE VERY HEARTILY AT YOUR SERVICE
THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL
AN ANOMALY WHICH OFTEN STRUCK ME IN THE CHARACTER OF MY FRIEND
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS THAT ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS
THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND AND ALTHOUGH ALSO HE
AFFECTED A CERTAIN QUIET PRIMNESS OF DRESS HE WAS NONE THE LESS IN
HIS PERSONAL HABITS ONE OF THE MOST UNTIDY MEN THAT EVER DROVE A
FELLOWLODGER TO DISTRACTION NOT THAT I AM IN THE LEAST CONVENTIONAL
IN THAT RESPECT MYSELF THE ROUGHANDTUMBLE WORK IN AFGHANISTAN
COMING ON THE TOP OF A NATURAL BOHEMIANISM OF DISPOSITION HAS MADE
ME RATHER MORE LAX THAN BEFITS A MEDICAL MAN BUT WITH ME THERE IS A
LIMIT AND WHEN I FIND A MAN WHO KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE
COALSCUTTLE HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER AND
HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACKKNIFE INTO THE
VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE THEN I BEGIN TO GIVE MYSELF
VIRTUOUS AIRS I HAVE ALWAYS HELD TOO THAT PISTOL PRACTICE SHOULD
BE DISTINCTLY AN OPENAIR PASTIME AND WHEN HOLMES IN ONE OF HIS
QUEER HUMORS WOULD SIT IN AN ARMCHAIR WITH HIS HAIRTRIGGER AND A
HUNDRED BOXER CARTRIDGES AND PROCEED TO ADORN THE OPPOSITE WALL WITH
A PATRIOTIC V R DONE IN BULLETPOCKS I FELT STRONGLY THAT NEITHER
THE ATMOSPHERE NOR THE APPEARANCE OF OUR ROOM WAS IMPROVED BY IT
OUR CHAMBERS WERE ALWAYS FULL OF CHEMICALS AND OF CRIMINAL RELICS
WHICH HAD A WAY OF WANDERING INTO UNLIKELY POSITIONS AND OF TURNING
UP IN THE BUTTERDISH OR IN EVEN LESS DESIRABLE PLACES BUT HIS
PAPERS WERE MY GREAT CRUX HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH WERE CONNECTED WITH HIS PAST CASES AND YET IT
WAS ONLY ONCE IN EVERY YEAR OR TWO THAT HE WOULD MUSTER ENERGY TO
DOCKET AND ARRANGE THEM FOR AS I HAVE MENTIONED SOMEWHERE IN THESE
INCOHERENT MEMOIRS THE OUTBURSTS OF PASSIONATE ENERGY WHEN HE
PERFORMED THE REMARKABLE FEATS WITH WHICH HIS NAME IS ASSOCIATED WERE
FOLLOWED BY REACTIONS OF LETHARGY DURING WHICH HE WOULD LIE ABOUT
WITH HIS VIOLIN AND HIS BOOKS HARDLY MOVING SAVE FROM THE SOFA TO
THE TABLE THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED UNTIL EVERY
CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE
ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY
THEIR OWNER ONE WINTERS NIGHT AS WE SAT TOGETHER BY THE FIRE I
VENTURED TO SUGGEST TO HIM THAT AS HE HAD FINISHED PASTING EXTRACTS
INTO HIS COMMONPLACE BOOK HE MIGHT EMPLOY THE NEXT TWO HOURS IN
MAKING OUR ROOM A LITTLE MORE HABITABLE HE COULD NOT DENY THE
JUSTICE OF MY REQUEST SO WITH A RATHER RUEFUL FACE HE WENT OFF TO
HIS BEDROOM FROM WHICH HE RETURNED PRESENTLY PULLING A LARGE TIN BOX
BEHIND HIM THIS HE PLACED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR AND SQUATTING
DOWN UPON A STOOL IN FRONT OF IT HE THREW BACK THE LID I COULD SEE
THAT IT WAS ALREADY A THIRD FULL OF BUNDLES OF PAPER TIED UP WITH RED
TAPE INTO SEPARATE PACKAGES
THERE ARE CASES ENOUGH HERE WATSON SAID HE LOOKING AT ME WITH
MISCHIEVOUS EYES I THINK THAT IF YOU KNEW ALL THAT I HAD IN THIS
BOX YOU WOULD ASK ME TO PULL SOME OUT INSTEAD OF PUTTING OTHERS IN
THESE ARE THE RECORDS OF YOUR EARLY WORK THEN I ASKED I HAVE
OFTEN WISHED THAT I HAD NOTES OF THOSE CASES
YES MY BOY THESE WERE ALL DONE PREMATURELY BEFORE MY BIOGRAPHER
HAD COME TO GLORIFY ME HE LIFTED BUNDLE AFTER BUNDLE IN A TENDER
CARESSING SORT OF WAY THEY ARE NOT ALL SUCCESSES WATSON SAID HE
BUT THERE ARE SOME PRETTY LITTLE PROBLEMS AMONG THEM HERES THE
RECORD OF THE TARLETON MURDERS AND THE CASE OF VAMBERRY THE WINE
MERCHANT AND THE ADVENTURE OF THE OLD RUSSIAN WOMAN AND THE
SINGULAR AFFAIR OF THE ALUMINIUM CRUTCH AS WELL AS A FULL ACCOUNT OF
RICOLETTI OF THE CLUBFOOT AND HIS ABOMINABLE WIFE AND HEREAH
NOW THIS REALLY IS SOMETHING A LITTLE RECHERCH
HE DIVED HIS ARM DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CHEST AND BROUGHT UP A
SMALL WOODEN BOX WITH A SLIDING LID SUCH AS CHILDRENS TOYS ARE KEPT
IN FROM WITHIN HE PRODUCED A CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER AN
OLDFASHIONED BRASS KEY A PEG OF WOOD WITH A BALL OF STRING ATTACHED
TO IT AND THREE RUSTY OLD DISKS OF METAL
WELL MY BOY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS LOT HE ASKED SMILING AT MY
EXPRESSION
IT IS A CURIOUS COLLECTION
VERY CURIOUS AND THE STORY THAT HANGS ROUND IT WILL STRIKE YOU AS
BEING MORE CURIOUS STILL
THESE RELICS HAVE A HISTORY THEN
SO MUCH SO THAT THEY ARE HISTORY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
SHERLOCK HOLMES PICKED THEM UP ONE BY ONE AND LAID THEM ALONG THE
EDGE OF THE TABLE THEN HE RESEATED HIMSELF IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED
THEM OVER WITH A GLEAM OF SATISFACTION IN HIS EYES
THESE SAID HE ARE ALL THAT I HAVE LEFT TO REMIND ME OF THE
ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL
I HAD HEARD HIM MENTION THE CASE MORE THAN ONCE THOUGH I HAD NEVER
BEEN ABLE TO GATHER THE DETAILS I SHOULD BE SO GLAD SAID I IF
YOU WOULD GIVE ME AN ACCOUNT OF IT
AND LEAVE THE LITTER AS IT IS HE CRIED MISCHIEVOUSLY YOUR
TIDINESS WONT BEAR MUCH STRAIN AFTER ALL WATSON BUT I SHOULD BE
GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ADD THIS CASE TO YOUR ANNALS FOR THERE ARE
POINTS IN IT WHICH MAKE IT QUITE UNIQUE IN THE CRIMINAL RECORDS OF
THIS OR I BELIEVE OF ANY OTHER COUNTRY A COLLECTION OF MY TRIFLING
ACHIEVEMENTS WOULD CERTAINLY BE INCOMPLETE WHICH CONTAINED NO ACCOUNT
OF THIS VERY SINGULAR BUSINESS
YOU MAY REMEMBER HOW THE AFFAIR OF THE GLORIA SCOTT AND MY
CONVERSATION WITH THE UNHAPPY MAN WHOSE FATE I TOLD YOU OF FIRST
TURNED MY ATTENTION IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PROFESSION WHICH HAS
BECOME MY LIFES WORK YOU SEE ME NOW WHEN MY NAME HAS BECOME KNOWN
FAR AND WIDE AND WHEN I AM GENERALLY RECOGNIZED BOTH BY THE PUBLIC
AND BY THE OFFICIAL FORCE AS BEING A FINAL COURT OF APPEAL IN
DOUBTFUL CASES EVEN WHEN YOU KNEW ME FIRST AT THE TIME OF THE
AFFAIR WHICH YOU HAVE COMMEMORATED IN A STUDY IN SCARLET I HAD
ALREADY ESTABLISHED A CONSIDERABLE THOUGH NOT A VERY LUCRATIVE
CONNECTION YOU CAN HARDLY REALIZE THEN HOW DIFFICULT I FOUND IT AT
FIRST AND HOW LONG I HAD TO WAIT BEFORE I SUCCEEDED IN MAKING ANY
HEADWAY
WHEN I FIRST CAME UP TO LONDON I HAD ROOMS IN MONTAGUE STREET JUST
ROUND THE CORNER FROM THE BRITISH MUSEUM AND THERE I WAITED FILLING
IN MY TOO ABUNDANT LEISURE TIME BY STUDYING ALL THOSE BRANCHES OF
SCIENCE WHICH MIGHT MAKE ME MORE EFFICIENT NOW AND AGAIN CASES CAME
IN MY WAY PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF OLD
FELLOWSTUDENTS FOR DURING MY LAST YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY THERE WAS
A GOOD DEAL OF TALK THERE ABOUT MYSELF AND MY METHODS THE THIRD OF
THESE CASES WAS THAT OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL AND IT IS TO THE
INTEREST WHICH WAS AROUSED BY THAT SINGULAR CHAIN OF EVENTS AND THE
LARGE ISSUES WHICH PROVED TO BE AT STAKE THAT I TRACE MY FIRST
STRIDE TOWARDS THE POSITION WHICH I NOW HOLD
REGINALD MUSGRAVE HAD BEEN IN THE SAME COLLEGE AS MYSELF AND I HAD
SOME SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM HE WAS NOT GENERALLY POPULAR AMONG
THE UNDERGRADUATES THOUGH IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT WHAT WAS SET
DOWN AS PRIDE WAS REALLY AN ATTEMPT TO COVER EXTREME NATURAL
DIFFIDENCE IN APPEARANCE HE WAS A MAN OF EXCEEDINGLY ARISTOCRATIC
TYPE THIN HIGHNOSED AND LARGEEYED WITH LANGUID AND YET COURTLY
MANNERS HE WAS INDEED A SCION OF ONE OF THE VERY OLDEST FAMILIES IN
THE KINGDOM THOUGH HIS BRANCH WAS A CADET ONE WHICH HAD SEPARATED
FROM THE NORTHERN MUSGRAVES SOME TIME IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AND
HAD ESTABLISHED ITSELF IN WESTERN SUSSEX WHERE THE MANOR HOUSE OF
HURLSTONE IS PERHAPS THE OLDEST INHABITED BUILDING IN THE COUNTY
SOMETHING OF HIS BIRTH PLACE SEEMED TO CLING TO THE MAN AND I NEVER
LOOKED AT HIS PALE KEEN FACE OR THE POISE OF HIS HEAD WITHOUT
ASSOCIATING HIM WITH GRAY ARCHWAYS AND MULLIONED WINDOWS AND ALL THE
VENERABLE WRECKAGE OF A FEUDAL KEEP ONCE OR TWICE WE DRIFTED INTO
TALK AND I CAN REMEMBER THAT MORE THAN ONCE HE EXPRESSED A KEEN
INTEREST IN MY METHODS OF OBSERVATION AND INFERENCE
FOR FOUR YEARS I HAD SEEN NOTHING OF HIM UNTIL ONE MORNING HE WALKED
INTO MY ROOM IN MONTAGUE STREET HE HAD CHANGED LITTLE WAS DRESSED
LIKE A YOUNG MAN OF FASHIONHE WAS ALWAYS A BIT OF A DANDYAND
PRESERVED THE SAME QUIET SUAVE MANNER WHICH HAD FORMERLY
DISTINGUISHED HIM
HOW HAS ALL GONE WITH YOU MUSGRAVE I ASKED AFTER WE HAD
CORDIALLY SHAKEN HANDS
YOU PROBABLY HEARD OF MY POOR FATHERS DEATH SAID HE HE WAS
CARRIED OFF ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO SINCE THEN I HAVE OF COURSE HAD THE
HURLSTONE ESTATES TO MANAGE AND AS I AM MEMBER FOR MY DISTRICT AS
WELL MY LIFE HAS BEEN A BUSY ONE BUT I UNDERSTAND HOLMES THAT YOU
ARE TURNING TO PRACTICAL ENDS THOSE POWERS WITH WHICH YOU USED TO
AMAZE US
YES SAID I I HAVE TAKEN TO LIVING BY MY WITS
I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT FOR YOUR ADVICE AT PRESENT WOULD BE
EXCEEDINGLY VALUABLE TO ME WE HAVE HAD SOME VERY STRANGE DOINGS AT
HURLSTONE AND THE POLICE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO THROW NO LIGHT UPON THE
MATTER IT IS REALLY THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND INEXPLICABLE
BUSINESS
YOU CAN IMAGINE WITH WHAT EAGERNESS I LISTENED TO HIM WATSON FOR
THE VERY CHANCE FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN PANTING DURING ALL THOSE MONTHS
OF INACTION SEEMED TO HAVE COME WITHIN MY REACH IN MY INMOST HEART I
BELIEVED THAT I COULD SUCCEED WHERE OTHERS FAILED AND NOW I HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO TEST MYSELF
PRAY LET ME HAVE THE DETAILS I CRIED
REGINALD MUSGRAVE SAT DOWN OPPOSITE TO ME AND LIT THE CIGARETTE
WHICH I HAD PUSHED TOWARDS HIM
YOU MUST KNOW SAID HE THAT THOUGH I AM A BACHELOR I HAVE TO
KEEP UP A CONSIDERABLE STAFF OF SERVANTS AT HURLSTONE FOR IT IS A
RAMBLING OLD PLACE AND TAKES A GOOD DEAL OF LOOKING AFTER I
PRESERVE TOO AND IN THE PHEASANT MONTHS I USUALLY HAVE A
HOUSEPARTY SO THAT IT WOULD NOT DO TO BE SHORTHANDED ALTOGETHER
THERE ARE EIGHT MAIDS THE COOK THE BUTLER TWO FOOTMEN AND A BOY
THE GARDEN AND THE STABLES OF COURSE HAVE A SEPARATE STAFF
OF THESE SERVANTS THE ONE WHO HAD BEEN LONGEST IN OUR SERVICE WAS
BRUNTON THE BUTLER HE WAS A YOUNG SCHOOLMASTER OUT OF PLACE WHEN HE
WAS FIRST TAKEN UP BY MY FATHER BUT HE WAS A MAN OF GREAT ENERGY AND
CHARACTER AND HE SOON BECAME QUITE INVALUABLE IN THE HOUSEHOLD HE
WAS A WELLGROWN HANDSOME MAN WITH A SPLENDID FOREHEAD AND THOUGH
HE HAS BEEN WITH US FOR TWENTY YEARS HE CANNOT BE MORE THAN FORTY
NOW WITH HIS PERSONAL ADVANTAGES AND HIS EXTRAORDINARY GIFTSFOR HE
CAN SPEAK SEVERAL LANGUAGES AND PLAY NEARLY EVERY MUSICAL
INSTRUMENTIT IS WONDERFUL THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SATISFIED SO
LONG IN SUCH A POSITION BUT I SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS COMFORTABLE AND
LACKED ENERGY TO MAKE ANY CHANGE THE BUTLER OF HURLSTONE IS ALWAYS A
THING THAT IS REMEMBERED BY ALL WHO VISIT US
BUT THIS PARAGON HAS ONE FAULT HE IS A BIT OF A DON JUAN AND YOU
CAN IMAGINE THAT FOR A MAN LIKE HIM IT IS NOT A VERY DIFFICULT PART
TO PLAY IN A QUIET COUNTRY DISTRICT WHEN HE WAS MARRIED IT WAS ALL
RIGHT BUT SINCE HE HAS BEEN A WIDOWER WE HAVE HAD NO END OF TROUBLE
WITH HIM A FEW MONTHS AGO WE WERE IN HOPES THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO
SETTLE DOWN AGAIN FOR HE BECAME ENGAGED TO RACHEL HOWELLS OUR SECOND
HOUSEMAID BUT HE HAS THROWN HER OVER SINCE THEN AND TAKEN UP WITH
JANET TREGELLIS THE DAUGHTER OF THE HEAD GAMEKEEPER RACHELWHO IS
A VERY GOOD GIRL BUT OF AN EXCITABLE WELSH TEMPERAMENTHAD A SHARP
TOUCH OF BRAINFEVER AND GOES ABOUT THE HOUSE NOWOR DID UNTIL
YESTERDAYLIKE A BLACKEYED SHADOW OF HER FORMER SELF THAT WAS OUR
FIRST DRAMA AT HURLSTONE BUT A SECOND ONE CAME TO DRIVE IT FROM OUR
MINDS AND IT WAS PREFACED BY THE DISGRACE AND DISMISSAL OF BUTLER
BRUNTON
THIS WAS HOW IT CAME ABOUT I HAVE SAID THAT THE MAN WAS
INTELLIGENT AND THIS VERY INTELLIGENCE HAS CAUSED HIS RUIN FOR IT
SEEMS TO HAVE LED TO AN INSATIABLE CURIOSITY ABOUT THINGS WHICH DID
NOT IN THE LEAST CONCERN HIM I HAD NO IDEA OF THE LENGTHS TO WHICH
THIS WOULD CARRY HIM UNTIL THE MEREST ACCIDENT OPENED MY EYES TO IT
I HAVE SAID THAT THE HOUSE IS A RAMBLING ONE ONE DAY LAST WEEKON
THURSDAY NIGHT TO BE MORE EXACTI FOUND THAT I COULD NOT SLEEP
HAVING FOOLISHLY TAKEN A CUP OF STRONG CAF NOIR AFTER MY DINNER
AFTER STRUGGLING AGAINST IT UNTIL TWO IN THE MORNING I FELT THAT IT
WAS QUITE HOPELESS SO I ROSE AND LIT THE CANDLE WITH THE INTENTION
OF CONTINUING A NOVEL WHICH I WAS READING THE BOOK HOWEVER HAD
BEEN LEFT IN THE BILLIARDROOM SO I PULLED ON MY DRESSINGGOWN AND
STARTED OFF TO GET IT
IN ORDER TO REACH THE BILLIARDROOM I HAD TO DESCEND A FLIGHT OF
STAIRS AND THEN TO CROSS THE HEAD OF A PASSAGE WHICH LED TO THE
LIBRARY AND THE GUNROOM YOU CAN IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN AS I
LOOKED DOWN THIS CORRIDOR I SAW A GLIMMER OF LIGHT COMING FROM THE
OPEN DOOR OF THE LIBRARY I HAD MYSELF EXTINGUISHED THE LAMP AND
CLOSED THE DOOR BEFORE COMING TO BED NATURALLY MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS
OF BURGLARS THE CORRIDORS AT HURLSTONE HAVE THEIR WALLS LARGELY
DECORATED WITH TROPHIES OF OLD WEAPONS FROM ONE OF THESE I PICKED A
BATTLEAXE AND THEN LEAVING MY CANDLE BEHIND ME I CREPT ON TIPTOE
DOWN THE PASSAGE AND PEEPED IN AT THE OPEN DOOR
BRUNTON THE BUTLER WAS IN THE LIBRARY HE WAS SITTING FULLY
DRESSED IN AN EASYCHAIR WITH A SLIP OF PAPER WHICH LOOKED LIKE A
MAP UPON HIS KNEE AND HIS FOREHEAD SUNK FORWARD UPON HIS HAND IN
DEEP THOUGHT I STOOD DUMB WITH ASTONISHMENT WATCHING HIM FROM THE
DARKNESS A SMALL TAPER ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE SHED A FEEBLE LIGHT
WHICH SUFFICED TO SHOW ME THAT HE WAS FULLY DRESSED SUDDENLY AS I
LOOKED HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND WALKING OVER TO A BUREAU AT THE
SIDE HE UNLOCKED IT AND DREW OUT ONE OF THE DRAWERS FROM THIS HE
TOOK A PAPER AND RETURNING TO HIS SEAT HE FLATTENED IT OUT BESIDE
THE TAPER ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE AND BEGAN TO STUDY IT WITH MINUTE
ATTENTION MY INDIGNATION AT THIS CALM EXAMINATION OF OUR FAMILY
DOCUMENTS OVERCAME ME SO FAR THAT I TOOK A STEP FORWARD AND BRUNTON
LOOKING UP SAW ME STANDING IN THE DOORWAY HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET
HIS FACE TURNED LIVID WITH FEAR AND HE THRUST INTO HIS BREAST THE
CHARTLIKE PAPER WHICH HE HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY STUDYING
SO SAID I THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY THE TRUST WHICH WE HAVE
REPOSED IN YOU YOU WILL LEAVE MY SERVICE TOMORROW
HE BOWED WITH THE LOOK OF A MAN WHO IS UTTERLY CRUSHED AND SLUNK
PAST ME WITHOUT A WORD THE TAPER WAS STILL ON THE TABLE AND BY ITS
LIGHT I GLANCED TO SEE WHAT THE PAPER WAS WHICH BRUNTON HAD TAKEN
FROM THE BUREAU TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS NOTHING OF ANY IMPORTANCE AT
ALL BUT SIMPLY A COPY OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS IN THE SINGULAR
OLD OBSERVANCE CALLED THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL IT IS A SORT OF CEREMONY
PECULIAR TO OUR FAMILY WHICH EACH MUSGRAVE FOR CENTURIES PAST HAS
GONE THROUGH ON HIS COMING OF AGEA THING OF PRIVATE INTEREST AND
PERHAPS OF SOME LITTLE IMPORTANCE TO THE ARCHAEOLOGIST LIKE OUR OWN
BLAZONINGS AND CHARGES BUT OF NO PRACTICAL USE WHATEVER
WE HAD BETTER COME BACK TO THE PAPER AFTERWARDS SAID I
IF YOU THINK IT REALLY NECESSARY HE ANSWERED WITH SOME
HESITATION TO CONTINUE MY STATEMENT HOWEVER I RELOCKED THE
BUREAU USING THE KEY WHICH BRUNTON HAD LEFT AND I HAD TURNED TO GO
WHEN I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE BUTLER HAD RETURNED AND WAS
STANDING BEFORE ME
MR MUSGRAVE SIR HE CRIED IN A VOICE WHICH WAS HOARSE WITH
EMOTION I CANT BEAR DISGRACE SIR IVE ALWAYS BEEN PROUD ABOVE MY
STATION IN LIFE AND DISGRACE WOULD KILL ME MY BLOOD WILL BE ON YOUR
HEAD SIRIT WILL INDEEDIF YOU DRIVE ME TO DESPAIR IF YOU CANNOT
KEEP ME AFTER WHAT HAS PASSED THEN FOR GODS SAKE LET ME GIVE YOU
NOTICE AND LEAVE IN A MONTH AS IF OF MY OWN FREE WILL I COULD STAND
THAT MR MUSGRAVE BUT NOT TO BE CAST OUT BEFORE ALL THE FOLK THAT I
KNOW SO WELL
YOU DONT DESERVE MUCH CONSIDERATION BRUNTON I ANSWERED YOUR
CONDUCT HAS BEEN MOST INFAMOUS HOWEVER AS YOU HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME
IN THE FAMILY I HAVE NO WISH TO BRING PUBLIC DISGRACE UPON YOU A
MONTH HOWEVER IS TOO LONG TAKE YOURSELF AWAY IN A WEEK AND GIVE
WHAT REASON YOU LIKE FOR GOING
ONLY A WEEK SIR HE CRIED IN A DESPAIRING VOICE A
FORTNIGHTSAY AT LEAST A FORTNIGHT
A WEEK I REPEATED AND YOU MAY CONSIDER YOURSELF TO HAVE BEEN
VERY LENIENTLY DEALT WITH
HE CREPT AWAY HIS FACE SUNK UPON HIS BREAST LIKE A BROKEN MAN
WHILE I PUT OUT THE LIGHT AND RETURNED TO MY ROOM
FOR TWO DAYS AFTER THIS BRUNTON WAS MOST ASSIDUOUS IN HIS ATTENTION
TO HIS DUTIES I MADE NO ALLUSION TO WHAT HAD PASSED AND WAITED WITH
SOME CURIOSITY TO SEE HOW HE WOULD COVER HIS DISGRACE ON THE THIRD
MORNING HOWEVER HE DID NOT APPEAR AS WAS HIS CUSTOM AFTER
BREAKFAST TO RECEIVE MY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DAY AS I LEFT THE
DININGROOM I HAPPENED TO MEET RACHEL HOWELLS THE MAID I HAVE TOLD
YOU THAT SHE HAD ONLY RECENTLY RECOVERED FROM AN ILLNESS AND WAS
LOOKING SO WRETCHEDLY PALE AND WAN THAT I REMONSTRATED WITH HER FOR
BEING AT WORK
YOU SHOULD BE IN BED I SAID COME BACK TO YOUR DUTIES WHEN YOU
ARE STRONGER
SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH SO STRANGE AN EXPRESSION THAT I BEGAN TO
SUSPECT THAT HER BRAIN WAS AFFECTED
I AM STRONG ENOUGH MR MUSGRAVE SAID SHE
WE WILL SEE WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS I ANSWERED YOU MUST STOP WORK
NOW AND WHEN YOU GO DOWNSTAIRS JUST SAY THAT I WISH TO SEE BRUNTON
THE BUTLER IS GONE SAID SHE
GONE GONE WHERE
HE IS GONE NO ONE HAS SEEN HIM HE IS NOT IN HIS ROOM OH YES
HE IS GONE HE IS GONE SHE FELL BACK AGAINST THE WALL WITH SHRIEK
AFTER SHRIEK OF LAUGHTER WHILE I HORRIFIED AT THIS SUDDEN
HYSTERICAL ATTACK RUSHED TO THE BELL TO SUMMON HELP THE GIRL WAS
TAKEN TO HER ROOM STILL SCREAMING AND SOBBING WHILE I MADE
INQUIRIES ABOUT BRUNTON THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THAT HE HAD
DISAPPEARED HIS BED HAD NOT BEEN SLEPT IN HE HAD BEEN SEEN BY NO
ONE SINCE HE HAD RETIRED TO HIS ROOM THE NIGHT BEFORE AND YET IT WAS
DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW HE COULD HAVE LEFT THE HOUSE AS BOTH WINDOWS
AND DOORS WERE FOUND TO BE FASTENED IN THE MORNING HIS CLOTHES HIS
WATCH AND EVEN HIS MONEY WERE IN HIS ROOM BUT THE BLACK SUIT WHICH
HE USUALLY WORE WAS MISSING HIS SLIPPERS TOO WERE GONE BUT HIS
BOOTS WERE LEFT BEHIND WHERE THEN COULD BUTLER BRUNTON HAVE GONE IN
THE NIGHT AND WHAT COULD HAVE BECOME OF HIM NOW
OF COURSE WE SEARCHED THE HOUSE FROM CELLAR TO GARRET BUT THERE
WAS NO TRACE OF HIM IT IS AS I HAVE SAID A LABYRINTH OF AN OLD
HOUSE ESPECIALLY THE ORIGINAL WING WHICH IS NOW PRACTICALLY
UNINHABITED BUT WE RANSACKED EVERY ROOM AND CELLAR WITHOUT
DISCOVERING THE LEAST SIGN OF THE MISSING MAN IT WAS INCREDIBLE TO
ME THAT HE COULD HAVE GONE AWAY LEAVING ALL HIS PROPERTY BEHIND HIM
AND YET WHERE COULD HE BE I CALLED IN THE LOCAL POLICE BUT WITHOUT
SUCCESS RAIN HAD FALLEN ON THE NIGHT BEFORE AND WE EXAMINED THE LAWN
AND THE PATHS ALL ROUND THE HOUSE BUT IN VAIN MATTERS WERE IN THIS
STATE WHEN A NEW DEVELOPMENT QUITE DREW OUR ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE
ORIGINAL MYSTERY
FOR TWO DAYS RACHEL HOWELLS HAD BEEN SO ILL SOMETIMES DELIRIOUS
SOMETIMES HYSTERICAL THAT A NURSE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED TO SIT UP WITH
HER AT NIGHT ON THE THIRD NIGHT AFTER BRUNTONS DISAPPEARANCE THE
NURSE FINDING HER PATIENT SLEEPING NICELY HAD DROPPED INTO A NAP IN
THE ARMCHAIR WHEN SHE WOKE IN THE EARLY MORNING TO FIND THE BED
EMPTY THE WINDOW OPEN AND NO SIGNS OF THE INVALID I WAS INSTANTLY
AROUSED AND WITH THE TWO FOOTMEN STARTED OFF AT ONCE IN SEARCH OF
THE MISSING GIRL IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO TELL THE DIRECTION WHICH
SHE HAD TAKEN FOR STARTING FROM UNDER HER WINDOW WE COULD FOLLOW
HER FOOTMARKS EASILY ACROSS THE LAWN TO THE EDGE OF THE MERE WHERE
THEY VANISHED CLOSE TO THE GRAVEL PATH WHICH LEADS OUT OF THE
GROUNDS THE LAKE THERE IS EIGHT FEET DEEP AND YOU CAN IMAGINE OUR
FEELINGS WHEN WE SAW THAT THE TRAIL OF THE POOR DEMENTED GIRL CAME TO
AN END AT THE EDGE OF IT
OF COURSE WE HAD THE DRAGS AT ONCE AND SET TO WORK TO RECOVER THE
REMAINS BUT NO TRACE OF THE BODY COULD WE FIND ON THE OTHER HAND
WE BROUGHT TO THE SURFACE AN OBJECT OF A MOST UNEXPECTED KIND IT WAS
A LINEN BAG WHICH CONTAINED WITHIN IT A MASS OF OLD RUSTED AND
DISCOLORED METAL AND SEVERAL DULLCOLORED PIECES OF PEBBLE OR GLASS
THIS STRANGE FIND WAS ALL THAT WE COULD GET FROM THE MERE AND
ALTHOUGH WE MADE EVERY POSSIBLE SEARCH AND INQUIRY YESTERDAY WE KNOW
NOTHING OF THE FATE EITHER OF RACHEL HOWELLS OR OF RICHARD BRUNTON
THE COUNTY POLICE ARE AT THEIR WITS END AND I HAVE COME UP TO YOU
AS A LAST RESOURCE
YOU CAN IMAGINE WATSON WITH WHAT EAGERNESS I LISTENED TO THIS
EXTRAORDINARY SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AND ENDEAVORED TO PIECE THEM
TOGETHER AND TO DEVISE SOME COMMON THREAD UPON WHICH THEY MIGHT ALL
HANG THE BUTLER WAS GONE THE MAID WAS GONE THE MAID HAD LOVED THE
BUTLER BUT HAD AFTERWARDS HAD CAUSE TO HATE HIM SHE WAS OF WELSH
BLOOD FIERY AND PASSIONATE SHE HAD BEEN TERRIBLY EXCITED
IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS DISAPPEARANCE SHE HAD FLUNG INTO THE LAKE A
BAG CONTAINING SOME CURIOUS CONTENTS THESE WERE ALL FACTORS WHICH
HAD TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND YET NONE OF THEM GOT QUITE TO
THE HEART OF THE MATTER WHAT WAS THE STARTINGPOINT OF THIS CHAIN OF
EVENTS THERE LAY THE END OF THIS TANGLED LINE
I MUST SEE THAT PAPER MUSGRAVE SAID I WHICH THIS BUTLER OF
YOUR THOUGHT IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO CONSULT EVEN AT THE RISK OF THE
LOSS OF HIS PLACE
IT IS RATHER AN ABSURD BUSINESS THIS RITUAL OF OURS HE ANSWERED
BUT IT HAS AT LEAST THE SAVING GRACE OF ANTIQUITY TO EXCUSE IT I
HAVE A COPY OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS HERE IF YOU CARE TO RUN YOUR
EYE OVER THEM
HE HANDED ME THE VERY PAPER WHICH I HAVE HERE WATSON AND THIS IS
THE STRANGE CATECHISM TO WHICH EACH MUSGRAVE HAD TO SUBMIT WHEN HE
CAME TO MANS ESTATE I WILL READ YOU THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AS
THEY STAND
WHOSE WAS IT
HIS WHO IS GONE
WHO SHALL HAVE IT
HE WHO WILL COME
WHAT WAS THE MONTH
THE SIXTH FROM THE FIRST
WHERE WAS THE SUN
OVER THE OAK
WHERE WAS THE SHADOW
UNDER THE ELM
HOW WAS IT STEPPED
NORTH BY TEN AND BY TEN EAST BY FIVE AND BY FIVE SOUTH BY TWO AND
BY TWO WEST BY ONE AND BY ONE AND SO UNDER
WHAT SHALL WE GIVE FOR IT
ALL THAT IS OURS
WHY SHOULD WE GIVE IT
FOR THE SAKE OF THE TRUST
THE ORIGINAL HAS NO DATE BUT IS IN THE SPELLING OF THE MIDDLE OF
THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY REMARKED MUSGRAVE I AM AFRAID HOWEVER
THAT IT CAN BE OF LITTLE HELP TO YOU IN SOLVING THIS MYSTERY
AT LEAST SAID I IT GIVES US ANOTHER MYSTERY AND ONE WHICH IS
EVEN MORE INTERESTING THAN THE FIRST IT MAY BE THAT THE SOLUTION OF
THE ONE MAY PROVE TO BE THE SOLUTION OF THE OTHER YOU WILL EXCUSE
ME MUSGRAVE IF I SAY THAT YOUR BUTLER APPEARS TO ME TO HAVE BEEN A
VERY CLEVER MAN AND TO HAVE HAD A CLEARER INSIGHT THAT TEN
GENERATIONS OF HIS MASTERS
I HARDLY FOLLOW YOU SAID MUSGRAVE THE PAPER SEEMS TO ME TO BE
OF NO PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE
BUT TO ME IT SEEMS IMMENSELY PRACTICAL AND I FANCY THAT BRUNTON
TOOK THE SAME VIEW HE HAD PROBABLY SEEN IT BEFORE THAT NIGHT ON
WHICH YOU CAUGHT HIM
IT IS VERY POSSIBLE WE TOOK NO PAINS TO HIDE IT
HE SIMPLY WISHED I SHOULD IMAGINE TO REFRESH HIS MEMORY UPON THAT
LAST OCCASION HE HAD AS I UNDERSTAND SOME SORT OF MAP OR CHART
WHICH HE WAS COMPARING WITH THE MANUSCRIPT AND WHICH HE THRUST INTO
HIS POCKET WHEN YOU APPEARED
THAT IS TRUE BUT WHAT COULD HE HAVE TO DO WITH THIS OLD FAMILY
CUSTOM OF OURS AND WHAT DOES THIS RIGMAROLE MEAN
I DONT THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE MUCH DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING
THAT SAID I WITH YOUR PERMISSION WE WILL TAKE THE FIRST TRAIN
DOWN TO SUSSEX AND GO A LITTLE MORE DEEPLY INTO THE MATTER UPON THE
SPOT
THE SAME AFTERNOON SAW US BOTH AT HURLSTONE POSSIBLY YOU HAVE SEEN
PICTURES AND READ DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FAMOUS OLD BUILDING SO I WILL
CONFINE MY ACCOUNT OF IT TO SAYING THAT IT IS BUILT IN THE SHAPE OF
AN L THE LONG ARM BEING THE MORE MODERN PORTION AND THE SHORTER THE
ANCIENT NUCLEUS FROM WHICH THE OTHER HAD DEVELOPED OVER THE LOW
HEAVILYLINTELLED DOOR IN THE CENTRE OF THIS OLD PART IS CHISELED
THE DATE BUT EXPERTS ARE AGREED THAT THE BEAMS AND STONEWORK
ARE REALLY MUCH OLDER THAN THIS THE ENORMOUSLY THICK WALLS AND TINY
WINDOWS OF THIS PART HAD IN THE LAST CENTURY DRIVEN THE FAMILY INTO
BUILDING THE NEW WING AND THE OLD ONE WAS USED NOW AS A STOREHOUSE
AND A CELLAR WHEN IT WAS USED AT ALL A SPLENDID PARK WITH FINE OLD
TIMBER SURROUNDS THE HOUSE AND THE LAKE TO WHICH MY CLIENT HAD
REFERRED LAY CLOSE TO THE AVENUE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE
BUILDING
I WAS ALREADY FIRMLY CONVINCED WATSON THAT THERE WERE NOT THREE
SEPARATE MYSTERIES HERE BUT ONE ONLY AND THAT IF I COULD READ THE
MUSGRAVE RITUAL ARIGHT I SHOULD HOLD IN MY HAND THE CLUE WHICH WOULD
LEAD ME TO THE TRUTH CONCERNING BOTH THE BUTLER BRUNTON AND THE MAID
HOWELLS TO THAT THEN I TURNED ALL MY ENERGIES WHY SHOULD THIS
SERVANT BE SO ANXIOUS TO MASTER THIS OLD FORMULA EVIDENTLY BECAUSE
HE SAW SOMETHING IN IT WHICH HAD ESCAPED ALL THOSE GENERATIONS OF
COUNTRY SQUIRES AND FROM WHICH HE EXPECTED SOME PERSONAL ADVANTAGE
WHAT WAS IT THEN AND HOW HAD IT AFFECTED HIS FATE
IT WAS PERFECTLY OBVIOUS TO ME ON READING THE RITUAL THAT THE
MEASUREMENTS MUST REFER TO SOME SPOT TO WHICH THE REST OF THE
DOCUMENT ALLUDED AND THAT IF WE COULD FIND THAT SPOT WE SHOULD BE
IN A FAIR WAY TOWARDS FINDING WHAT THE SECRET WAS WHICH THE OLD
MUSGRAVES HAD THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO EMBALM IN SO CURIOUS A FASHION
THERE WERE TWO GUIDES GIVEN US TO START WITH AN OAK AND AN ELM AS
TO THE OAK THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION AT ALL RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE
HOUSE UPON THE LEFTHAND SIDE OF THE DRIVE THERE STOOD A PATRIARCH
AMONG OAKS ONE OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT TREES THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN
THAT WAS THERE WHEN YOUR RITUAL WAS DRAWN UP SAID I AS WE DROVE
PAST IT
IT WAS THERE AT THE NORMAN CONQUEST IN ALL PROBABILITY HE
ANSWERED IT HAS A GIRTH OF TWENTYTHREE FEET
HERE WAS ONE OF MY FIXED POINTS SECURED
HAVE YOU ANY OLD ELMS I ASKED
THERE USED TO BE A VERY OLD ONE OVER YONDER BUT IT WAS STRUCK BY
LIGHTNING TEN YEARS AGO AND WE CUT DOWN THE STUMP
YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT USED TO BE
OH YES
THERE ARE NO OTHER ELMS
NO OLD ONES BUT PLENTY OF BEECHES
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE WHERE IT GREW
WE HAD DRIVEN UP IN A DOGCART AND MY CLIENT LED ME AWAY AT ONCE
WITHOUT OUR ENTERING THE HOUSE TO THE SCAR ON THE LAWN WHERE THE ELM
HAD STOOD IT WAS NEARLY MIDWAY BETWEEN THE OAK AND THE HOUSE MY
INVESTIGATION SEEMED TO BE PROGRESSING
I SUPPOSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND OUT HOW HIGH THE ELM WAS I
ASKED
I CAN GIVE YOU IT AT ONCE IT WAS SIXTYFOUR FEET
HOW DO YOU COME TO KNOW IT I ASKED IN SURPRISE
WHEN MY OLD TUTOR USED TO GIVE ME AN EXERCISE IN TRIGONOMETRY IT
ALWAYS TOOK THE SHAPE OF MEASURING HEIGHTS WHEN I WAS A LAD I WORKED
OUT EVERY TREE AND BUILDING IN THE ESTATE
THIS WAS AN UNEXPECTED PIECE OF LUCK MY DATA WERE COMING MORE
QUICKLY THAN I COULD HAVE REASONABLY HOPED
TELL ME I ASKED DID YOUR BUTLER EVER ASK YOU SUCH A QUESTION
REGINALD MUSGRAVE LOOKED AT ME IN ASTONISHMENT NOW THAT YOU CALL
IT TO MY MIND HE ANSWERED BRUNTON DID ASK ME ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF
THE TREE SOME MONTHS AGO IN CONNECTION WITH SOME LITTLE ARGUMENT
WITH THE GROOM
THIS WAS EXCELLENT NEWS WATSON FOR IT SHOWED ME THAT I WAS ON THE
RIGHT ROAD I LOOKED UP AT THE SUN IT WAS LOW IN THE HEAVENS AND I
CALCULATED THAT IN LESS THAN AN HOUR IT WOULD LIE JUST ABOVE THE
TOPMOST BRANCHES OF THE OLD OAK ONE CONDITION MENTIONED IN THE
RITUAL WOULD THEN BE FULFILLED AND THE SHADOW OF THE ELM MUST MEAN
THE FARTHER END OF THE SHADOW OTHERWISE THE TRUNK WOULD HAVE BEEN
CHOSEN AS THE GUIDE I HAD THEN TO FIND WHERE THE FAR END OF THE
SHADOW WOULD FALL WHEN THE SUN WAS JUST CLEAR OF THE OAK
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT HOLMES WHEN THE ELM WAS NO LONGER
THERE
WELL AT LEAST I KNEW THAT IF BRUNTON COULD DO IT I COULD ALSO
BESIDES THERE WAS NO REAL DIFFICULTY I WENT WITH MUSGRAVE TO HIS
STUDY AND WHITTLED MYSELF THIS PEG TO WHICH I TIED THIS LONG STRING
WITH A KNOT AT EACH YARD THEN I TOOK TWO LENGTHS OF A FISHINGROD
WHICH CAME TO JUST SIX FEET AND I WENT BACK WITH MY CLIENT TO WHERE
THE ELM HAD BEEN THE SUN WAS JUST GRAZING THE TOP OF THE OAK I
FASTENED THE ROD ON END MARKED OUT THE DIRECTION OF THE SHADOW AND
MEASURED IT IT WAS NINE FEET IN LENGTH
OF COURSE THE CALCULATION NOW WAS A SIMPLE ONE IF A ROD OF SIX FEET
THREW A SHADOW OF NINE A TREE OF SIXTYFOUR FEET WOULD THROW ONE OF
NINETYSIX AND THE LINE OF THE ONE WOULD OF COURSE BE THE LINE OF
THE OTHER I MEASURED OUT THE DISTANCE WHICH BROUGHT ME ALMOST TO
THE WALL OF THE HOUSE AND I THRUST A PEG INTO THE SPOT YOU CAN
IMAGINE MY EXULTATION WATSON WHEN WITHIN TWO INCHES OF MY PEG I SAW
A CONICAL DEPRESSION IN THE GROUND I KNEW THAT IT WAS THE MARK MADE
BY BRUNTON IN HIS MEASUREMENTS AND THAT I WAS STILL UPON HIS TRAIL
FROM THIS STARTINGPOINT I PROCEEDED TO STEP HAVING FIRST TAKEN THE
CARDINAL POINTS BY MY POCKETCOMPASS TEN STEPS WITH EACH FOOT TOOK
ME ALONG PARALLEL WITH THE WALL OF THE HOUSE AND AGAIN I MARKED MY
SPOT WITH A PEG THEN I CAREFULLY PACED OFF FIVE TO THE EAST AND TWO
TO THE SOUTH IT BROUGHT ME TO THE VERY THRESHOLD OF THE OLD DOOR
TWO STEPS TO THE WEST MEANT NOW THAT I WAS TO GO TWO PACES DOWN THE
STONEFLAGGED PASSAGE AND THIS WAS THE PLACE INDICATED BY THE
RITUAL
NEVER HAVE I FELT SUCH A COLD CHILL OF DISAPPOINTMENT WATSON FOR A
MOMENT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THERE MUST BE SOME RADICAL MISTAKE IN MY
CALCULATIONS THE SETTING SUN SHONE FULL UPON THE PASSAGE FLOOR AND
I COULD SEE THAT THE OLD FOOTWORN GRAY STONES WITH WHICH IT WAS
PAVED WERE FIRMLY CEMENTED TOGETHER AND HAD CERTAINLY NOT BEEN MOVED
FOR MANY A LONG YEAR BRUNTON HAD NOT BEEN AT WORK HERE I TAPPED
UPON THE FLOOR BUT IT SOUNDED THE SAME ALL OVER AND THERE WAS NO
SIGN OF ANY CRACK OR CREVICE BUT FORTUNATELY MUSGRAVE WHO HAD
BEGUN TO APPRECIATE THE MEANING OF MY PROCEEDINGS AND WHO WAS NOW AS
EXCITED AS MYSELF TOOK OUT HIS MANUSCRIPT TO CHECK MY CALCULATION
AND UNDER HE CRIED YOU HAVE OMITTED THE AND UNDER
I HAD THOUGHT THAT IT MEANT THAT WE WERE TO DIG BUT NOW OF COURSE
I SAW AT ONCE THAT I WAS WRONG THERE IS A CELLAR UNDER THIS THEN
I CRIED
YES AND AS OLD AS THE HOUSE DOWN HERE THROUGH THIS DOOR
WE WENT DOWN A WINDING STONE STAIR AND MY COMPANION STRIKING A
MATCH LIT A LARGE LANTERN WHICH STOOD ON A BARREL IN THE CORNER IN
AN INSTANT IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT WE HAD AT LAST COME UPON THE TRUE
PLACE AND THAT WE HAD NOT BEEN THE ONLY PEOPLE TO VISIT THE SPOT
RECENTLY
IT HAD BEEN USED FOR THE STORAGE OF WOOD BUT THE BILLETS WHICH HAD
EVIDENTLY BEEN LITTERED OVER THE FLOOR WERE NOW PILED AT THE SIDES
SO AS TO LEAVE A CLEAR SPACE IN THE MIDDLE IN THIS SPACE LAY A LARGE
AND HEAVY FLAGSTONE WITH A RUSTED IRON RING IN THE CENTRE TO WHICH A
THICK SHEPHERDSCHECK MUFFLER WAS ATTACHED
BY JOVE CRIED MY CLIENT THATS BRUNTONS MUFFLER I HAVE SEEN
IT ON HIM AND COULD SWEAR TO IT WHAT HAS THE VILLAIN BEEN DOING
HERE
AT MY SUGGESTION A COUPLE OF THE COUNTY POLICE WERE SUMMONED TO BE
PRESENT AND I THEN ENDEAVORED TO RAISE THE STONE BY PULLING ON THE
CRAVAT I COULD ONLY MOVE IT SLIGHTLY AND IT WAS WITH THE AID OF ONE
OF THE CONSTABLES THAT I SUCCEEDED AT LAST IN CARRYING IT TO ONE
SIDE A BLACK HOLE YAWNED BENEATH INTO WHICH WE ALL PEERED WHILE
MUSGRAVE KNEELING AT THE SIDE PUSHED DOWN THE LANTERN
A SMALL CHAMBER ABOUT SEVEN FEET DEEP AND FOUR FEET SQUARE LAY OPEN
TO US AT ONE SIDE OF THIS WAS A SQUAT BRASSBOUND WOODEN BOX THE
LID OF WHICH WAS HINGED UPWARDS WITH THIS CURIOUS OLDFASHIONED KEY
PROJECTING FROM THE LOCK IT WAS FURRED OUTSIDE BY A THICK LAYER OF
DUST AND DAMP AND WORMS HAD EATEN THROUGH THE WOOD SO THAT A CROP
OF LIVID FUNGI WAS GROWING ON THE INSIDE OF IT SEVERAL DISCS OF
METAL OLD COINS APPARENTLY SUCH AS I HOLD HERE WERE SCATTERED OVER
THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX BUT IT CONTAINED NOTHING ELSE
AT THE MOMENT HOWEVER WE HAD NO THOUGHT FOR THE OLD CHEST FOR OUR
EYES WERE RIVETED UPON THAT WHICH CROUCHED BESIDE IT IT WAS THE
FIGURE OF A MAN CLAD IN A SUIT OF BLACK WHO SQUATTED DOWN UPON HIS
HAMS WITH HIS FOREHEAD SUNK UPON THE EDGE OF THE BOX AND HIS TWO ARMS
THROWN OUT ON EACH SIDE OF IT THE ATTITUDE HAD DRAWN ALL THE
STAGNANT BLOOD TO THE FACE AND NO MAN COULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT
DISTORTED LIVERCOLORED COUNTENANCE BUT HIS HEIGHT HIS DRESS AND
HIS HAIR WERE ALL SUFFICIENT TO SHOW MY CLIENT WHEN WE HAD DRAWN THE
BODY UP THAT IT WAS INDEED HIS MISSING BUTLER HE HAD BEEN DEAD SOME
DAYS BUT THERE WAS NO WOUND OR BRUISE UPON HIS PERSON TO SHOW HOW HE
HAD MET HIS DREADFUL END WHEN HIS BODY HAD BEEN CARRIED FROM THE
CELLAR WE FOUND OURSELVES STILL CONFRONTED WITH A PROBLEM WHICH WAS
ALMOST AS FORMIDABLE AS THAT WITH WHICH WE HAD STARTED
I CONFESS THAT SO FAR WATSON I HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN MY
INVESTIGATION I HAD RECKONED UPON SOLVING THE MATTER WHEN ONCE I HAD
FOUND THE PLACE REFERRED TO IN THE RITUAL BUT NOW I WAS THERE AND
WAS APPARENTLY AS FAR AS EVER FROM KNOWING WHAT IT WAS WHICH THE
FAMILY HAD CONCEALED WITH SUCH ELABORATE PRECAUTIONS IT IS TRUE THAT
I HAD THROWN A LIGHT UPON THE FATE OF BRUNTON BUT NOW I HAD TO
ASCERTAIN HOW THAT FATE HAD COME UPON HIM AND WHAT PART HAD BEEN
PLAYED IN THE MATTER BY THE WOMAN WHO HAD DISAPPEARED I SAT DOWN
UPON A KEG IN THE CORNER AND THOUGHT THE WHOLE MATTER CAREFULLY OVER
YOU KNOW MY METHODS IN SUCH CASES WATSON I PUT MYSELF IN THE MANS
PLACE AND HAVING FIRST GAUGED HIS INTELLIGENCE I TRY TO IMAGINE HOW
I SHOULD MYSELF HAVE PROCEEDED UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS
CASE THE MATTER WAS SIMPLIFIED BY BRUNTONS INTELLIGENCE BEING QUITE
FIRSTRATE SO THAT IT WAS UNNECESSARY TO MAKE ANY ALLOWANCE FOR THE
PERSONAL EQUATION AS THE ASTRONOMERS HAVE DUBBED IT HE KNEW THAT
SOMETHING VALUABLE WAS CONCEALED HE HAD SPOTTED THE PLACE HE FOUND
THAT THE STONE WHICH COVERED IT WAS JUST TOO HEAVY FOR A MAN TO MOVE
UNAIDED WHAT WOULD HE DO NEXT HE COULD NOT GET HELP FROM OUTSIDE
EVEN IF HE HAD SOME ONE WHOM HE COULD TRUST WITHOUT THE UNBARRING OF
DOORS AND CONSIDERABLE RISK OF DETECTION IT WAS BETTER IF HE COULD
TO HAVE HIS HELPMATE INSIDE THE HOUSE BUT WHOM COULD HE ASK THIS
GIRL HAD BEEN DEVOTED TO HIM A MAN ALWAYS FINDS IT HARD TO REALIZE
THAT HE MAY HAVE FINALLY LOST A WOMANS LOVE HOWEVER BADLY HE MAY
HAVE TREATED HER HE WOULD TRY BY A FEW ATTENTIONS TO MAKE HIS PEACE
WITH THE GIRL HOWELLS AND THEN WOULD ENGAGE HER AS HIS ACCOMPLICE
TOGETHER THEY WOULD COME AT NIGHT TO THE CELLAR AND THEIR UNITED
FORCE WOULD SUFFICE TO RAISE THE STONE SO FAR I COULD FOLLOW THEIR
ACTIONS AS IF I HAD ACTUALLY SEEN THEM
BUT FOR TWO OF THEM AND ONE A WOMAN IT MUST HAVE BEEN HEAVY WORK
THE RAISING OF THAT STONE A BURLY SUSSEX POLICEMAN AND I HAD FOUND
IT NO LIGHT JOB WHAT WOULD THEY DO TO ASSIST THEM PROBABLY WHAT I
SHOULD HAVE DONE MYSELF I ROSE AND EXAMINED CAREFULLY THE DIFFERENT
BILLETS OF WOOD WHICH WERE SCATTERED ROUND THE FLOOR ALMOST AT ONCE
I CAME UPON WHAT I EXPECTED ONE PIECE ABOUT THREE FEET IN LENGTH
HAD A VERY MARKED INDENTATION AT ONE END WHILE SEVERAL WERE
FLATTENED AT THE SIDES AS IF THEY HAD BEEN COMPRESSED BY SOME
CONSIDERABLE WEIGHT EVIDENTLY AS THEY HAD DRAGGED THE STONE UP THEY
HAD THRUST THE CHUNKS OF WOOD INTO THE CHINK UNTIL AT LAST WHEN THE
OPENING WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO CRAWL THROUGH THEY WOULD HOLD IT OPEN BY
A BILLET PLACED LENGTHWISE WHICH MIGHT VERY WELL BECOME INDENTED AT
THE LOWER END SINCE THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THE STONE WOULD PRESS IT
DOWN ON TO THE EDGE OF THIS OTHER SLAB SO FAR I WAS STILL ON SAFE
GROUND
AND NOW HOW WAS I TO PROCEED TO RECONSTRUCT THIS MIDNIGHT DRAMA
CLEARLY ONLY ONE COULD FIT INTO THE HOLE AND THAT ONE WAS BRUNTON
THE GIRL MUST HAVE WAITED ABOVE BRUNTON THEN UNLOCKED THE BOX
HANDED UP THE CONTENTS PRESUMABLYSINCE THEY WERE NOT TO BE
FOUNDAND THENAND THEN WHAT HAPPENED
WHAT SMOULDERING FIRE OF VENGEANCE HAD SUDDENLY SPRUNG INTO FLAME IN
THIS PASSIONATE CELTIC WOMANS SOUL WHEN SHE SAW THE MAN WHO HAD
WRONGED HERWRONGED HER PERHAPS FAR MORE THAN WE SUSPECTEDIN HER
POWER WAS IT A CHANCE THAT THE WOOD HAD SLIPPED AND THAT THE STONE
HAD SHUT BRUNTON INTO WHAT HAD BECOME HIS SEPULCHRE HAD SHE ONLY
BEEN GUILTY OF SILENCE AS TO HIS FATE OR HAD SOME SUDDEN BLOW FROM
HER HAND DASHED THE SUPPORT AWAY AND SENT THE SLAB CRASHING DOWN INTO
ITS PLACE BE THAT AS IT MIGHT I SEEMED TO SEE THAT WOMANS FIGURE
STILL CLUTCHING AT HER TREASURE TROVE AND FLYING WILDLY UP THE
WINDING STAIR WITH HER EARS RINGING PERHAPS WITH THE MUFFLED SCREAMS
FROM BEHIND HER AND WITH THE DRUMMING OF FRENZIED HANDS AGAINST THE
SLAB OF STONE WHICH WAS CHOKING HER FAITHLESS LOVERS LIFE OUT
HERE WAS THE SECRET OF HER BLANCHED FACE HER SHAKEN NERVES HER
PEALS OF HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER ON THE NEXT MORNING BUT WHAT HAD BEEN
IN THE BOX WHAT HAD SHE DONE WITH THAT OF COURSE IT MUST HAVE BEEN
THE OLD METAL AND PEBBLES WHICH MY CLIENT HAD DRAGGED FROM THE MERE
SHE HAD THROWN THEM IN THERE AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE THE
LAST TRACE OF HER CRIME
FOR TWENTY MINUTES I HAD SAT MOTIONLESS THINKING THE MATTER OUT
MUSGRAVE STILL STOOD WITH A VERY PALE FACE SWINGING HIS LANTERN AND
PEERING DOWN INTO THE HOLE
THESE ARE COINS OF CHARLES THE FIRST SAID HE HOLDING OUT THE FEW
WHICH HAD BEEN IN THE BOX YOU SEE WE WERE RIGHT IN FIXING OUR DATE
FOR THE RITUAL
WE MAY FIND SOMETHING ELSE OF CHARLES THE FIRST I CRIED AS THE
PROBABLE MEANING OF THE FIRST TWO QUESTION OF THE RITUAL BROKE
SUDDENLY UPON ME LET ME SEE THE CONTENTS OF THE BAG WHICH YOU
FISHED FROM THE MERE
WE ASCENDED TO HIS STUDY AND HE LAID THE DEBRIS BEFORE ME I COULD
UNDERSTAND HIS REGARDING IT AS OF SMALL IMPORTANCE WHEN I LOOKED AT
IT FOR THE METAL WAS ALMOST BLACK AND THE STONES LUSTRELESS AND
DULL I RUBBED ONE OF THEM ON MY SLEEVE HOWEVER AND IT GLOWED
AFTERWARDS LIKE A SPARK IN THE DARK HOLLOW OF MY HAND THE METAL WORK
WAS IN THE FORM OF A DOUBLE RING BUT IT HAD BEEN BENT AND TWISTED
OUT OF ITS ORIGINAL SHAPE
YOU MUST BEAR IN MIND SAID I THAT THE ROYAL PARTY MADE HEAD IN
ENGLAND EVEN AFTER THE DEATH OF THE KING AND THAT WHEN THEY AT LAST
FLED THEY PROBABLY LEFT MANY OF THEIR MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSIONS
BURIED BEHIND THEM WITH THE INTENTION OF RETURNING FOR THEM IN MORE
PEACEFUL TIMES
MY ANCESTOR SIR RALPH MUSGRAVE WAS A PROMINENT CAVALIER AND THE
RIGHTHAND MAN OF CHARLES THE SECOND IN HIS WANDERINGS SAID MY
FRIEND
AH INDEED I ANSWERED WELL NOW I THINK THAT REALLY SHOULD GIVE
US THE LAST LINK THAT WE WANTED I MUST CONGRATULATE YOU ON COMING
INTO THE POSSESSION THOUGH IN RATHER A TRAGIC MANNER OF A RELIC
WHICH IS OF GREAT INTRINSIC VALUE BUT OF EVEN GREATER IMPORTANCE AS
AN HISTORICAL CURIOSITY
WHAT IS IT THEN HE GASPED IN ASTONISHMENT
IT IS NOTHING LESS THAN THE ANCIENT CROWN OF THE KINGS OF ENGLAND
THE CROWN
PRECISELY CONSIDER WHAT THE RITUAL SAYS HOW DOES IT RUN WHOSE
WAS IT HIS WHO IS GONE THAT WAS AFTER THE EXECUTION OF CHARLES
THEN WHO SHALL HAVE IT HE WHO WILL COME THAT WAS CHARLES THE
SECOND WHOSE ADVENT WAS ALREADY FORESEEN THERE CAN I THINK BE NO
DOUBT THAT THIS BATTERED AND SHAPELESS DIADEM ONCE ENCIRCLED THE
BROWS OF THE ROYAL STUARTS
AND HOW CAME IT IN THE POND
AH THAT IS A QUESTION THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO ANSWER AND
WITH THAT I SKETCHED OUT TO HIM THE WHOLE LONG CHAIN OF SURMISE AND
OF PROOF WHICH I HAD CONSTRUCTED THE TWILIGHT HAD CLOSED IN AND THE
MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY IN THE SKY BEFORE MY NARRATIVE WAS
FINISHED
AND HOW WAS IT THEN THAT CHARLES DID NOT GET HIS CROWN WHEN HE
RETURNED ASKED MUSGRAVE PUSHING BACK THE RELIC INTO ITS LINEN BAG
AH THERE YOU LAY YOUR FINGER UPON THE ONE POINT WHICH WE SHALL
PROBABLY NEVER BE ABLE TO CLEAR UP IT IS LIKELY THAT THE MUSGRAVE
WHO HELD THE SECRET DIED IN THE INTERVAL AND BY SOME OVERSIGHT LEFT
THIS GUIDE TO HIS DESCENDANT WITHOUT EXPLAINING THE MEANING OF IT
FROM THAT DAY TO THIS IT HAS BEEN HANDED DOWN FROM FATHER TO SON
UNTIL AT LAST IT CAME WITHIN REACH OF A MAN WHO TORE ITS SECRET OUT
OF IT AND LOST HIS LIFE IN THE VENTURE
AND THATS THE STORY OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL WATSON THEY HAVE THE
CROWN DOWN AT HURLSTONETHOUGH THEY HAD SOME LEGAL BOTHER AND A
CONSIDERABLE SUM TO PAY BEFORE THEY WERE ALLOWED TO RETAIN IT I AM
SURE THAT IF YOU MENTIONED MY NAME THEY WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHOW IT TO
YOU OF THE WOMAN NOTHING WAS EVER HEARD AND THE PROBABILITY IS THAT
SHE GOT AWAY OUT OF ENGLAND AND CARRIED HERSELF AND THE MEMORY OF HER
CRIME TO SOME LAND BEYOND THE SEAS
THE REIGATE SQUIRES
IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THE HEALTH OF MY FRIEND MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
RECOVERED FROM THE STRAIN CAUSED BY HIS IMMENSE EXERTIONS IN THE
SPRING OF THE WHOLE QUESTION OF THE NETHERLANDSUMATRA COMPANY
AND OF THE COLOSSAL SCHEMES OF BARON MAUPERTUIS ARE TOO RECENT IN THE
MINDS OF THE PUBLIC AND ARE TOO INTIMATELY CONCERNED WITH POLITICS
AND FINANCE TO BE FITTING SUBJECTS FOR THIS SERIES OF SKETCHES THEY
LED HOWEVER IN AN INDIRECT FASHION TO A SINGULAR AND COMPLEX
PROBLEM WHICH GAVE MY FRIEND AN OPPORTUNITY OF DEMONSTRATING THE
VALUE OF A FRESH WEAPON AMONG THE MANY WITH WHICH HE WAGED HIS
LIFELONG BATTLE AGAINST CRIME
ON REFERRING TO MY NOTES I SEE THAT IT WAS UPON THE TH OF APRIL
THAT I RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM LYONS WHICH INFORMED ME THAT HOLMES
WAS LYING ILL IN THE HOTEL DULONG WITHIN TWENTYFOUR HOURS I WAS IN
HIS SICKROOM AND WAS RELIEVED TO FIND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING
FORMIDABLE IN HIS SYMPTOMS EVEN HIS IRON CONSTITUTION HOWEVER HAD
BROKEN DOWN UNDER THE STRAIN OF AN INVESTIGATION WHICH HAD EXTENDED
OVER TWO MONTHS DURING WHICH PERIOD HE HAD NEVER WORKED LESS THAN
FIFTEEN HOURS A DAY AND HAD MORE THAN ONCE AS HE ASSURED ME KEPT
TO HIS TASK FOR FIVE DAYS AT A STRETCH EVEN THE TRIUMPHANT ISSUE OF
HIS LABORS COULD NOT SAVE HIM FROM REACTION AFTER SO TERRIBLE AN
EXERTION AND AT A TIME WHEN EUROPE WAS RINGING WITH HIS NAME AND
WHEN HIS ROOM WAS LITERALLY ANKLEDEEP WITH CONGRATULATORY TELEGRAMS
I FOUND HIM A PREY TO THE BLACKEST DEPRESSION EVEN THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT HE HAD SUCCEEDED WHERE THE POLICE OF THREE COUNTRIES HAD FAILED
AND THAT HE HAD OUTMANOEUVRED AT EVERY POINT THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED
SWINDLER IN EUROPE WAS INSUFFICIENT TO ROUSE HIM FROM HIS NERVOUS
PROSTRATION
THREE DAYS LATER WE WERE BACK IN BAKER STREET TOGETHER BUT IT WAS
EVIDENT THAT MY FRIEND WOULD BE MUCH THE BETTER FOR A CHANGE AND THE
THOUGHT OF A WEEK OF SPRING TIME IN THE COUNTRY WAS FULL OF
ATTRACTIONS TO ME ALSO MY OLD FRIEND COLONEL HAYTER WHO HAD COME
UNDER MY PROFESSIONAL CARE IN AFGHANISTAN HAD NOW TAKEN A HOUSE NEAR
REIGATE IN SURREY AND HAD FREQUENTLY ASKED ME TO COME DOWN TO HIM
UPON A VISIT ON THE LAST OCCASION HE HAD REMARKED THAT IF MY FRIEND
WOULD ONLY COME WITH ME HE WOULD BE GLAD TO EXTEND HIS HOSPITALITY TO
HIM ALSO A LITTLE DIPLOMACY WAS NEEDED BUT WHEN HOLMES UNDERSTOOD
THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE AND THAT HE WOULD BE
ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM HE FELL IN WITH MY PLANS AND A WEEK
AFTER OUR RETURN FROM LYONS WE WERE UNDER THE COLONELS ROOF HAYTER
WAS A FINE OLD SOLDIER WHO HAD SEEN MUCH OF THE WORLD AND HE SOON
FOUND AS I HAD EXPECTED THAT HOLMES AND HE HAD MUCH IN COMMON
ON THE EVENING OF OUR ARRIVAL WE WERE SITTING IN THE COLONELS
GUNROOM AFTER DINNER HOLMES STRETCHED UPON THE SOFA WHILE HAYTER
AND I LOOKED OVER HIS LITTLE ARMORY OF EASTERN WEAPONS
BY THE WAY SAID HE SUDDENLY I THINK ILL TAKE ONE OF THESE
PISTOLS UPSTAIRS WITH ME IN CASE WE HAVE AN ALARM
AN ALARM SAID I
YES WEVE HAD A SCARE IN THIS PART LATELY OLD ACTON WHO IS ONE OF
OUR COUNTY MAGNATES HAD HIS HOUSE BROKEN INTO LAST MONDAY NO GREAT
DAMAGE DONE BUT THE FELLOWS ARE STILL AT LARGE
NO CLUE ASKED HOLMES COCKING HIS EYE AT THE COLONEL
NONE AS YET BUT THE AFFAIR IS A PRETTY ONE ONE OF OUR LITTLE
COUNTRY CRIMES WHICH MUST SEEM TOO SMALL FOR YOUR ATTENTION MR
HOLMES AFTER THIS GREAT INTERNATIONAL AFFAIR
HOLMES WAVED AWAY THE COMPLIMENT THOUGH HIS SMILE SHOWED THAT IT HAD
PLEASED HIM
WAS THERE ANY FEATURE OF INTEREST
I FANCY NOT THE THIEVES RANSACKED THE LIBRARY AND GOT VERY LITTLE
FOR THEIR PAINS THE WHOLE PLACE WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN DRAWERS
BURST OPEN AND PRESSES RANSACKED WITH THE RESULT THAT AN ODD VOLUME
OF POPES HOMER TWO PLATED CANDLESTICKS AN IVORY LETTERWEIGHT A
SMALL OAK BAROMETER AND A BALL OF TWINE ARE ALL THAT HAVE VANISHED
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY ASSORTMENT I EXCLAIMED
OH THE FELLOWS EVIDENTLY GRABBED HOLD OF EVERYTHING THEY COULD
GET
HOLMES GRUNTED FROM THE SOFA
THE COUNTY POLICE OUGHT TO MAKE SOMETHING OF THAT SAID HE WHY
IT IS SURELY OBVIOUS THAT
BUT I HELD UP A WARNING FINGER
YOU ARE HERE FOR A REST MY DEAR FELLOW FOR HEAVENS SAKE DONT GET
STARTED ON A NEW PROBLEM WHEN YOUR NERVES ARE ALL IN SHREDS
HOLMES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WITH A GLANCE OF COMIC RESIGNATION
TOWARDS THE COLONEL AND THE TALK DRIFTED AWAY INTO LESS DANGEROUS
CHANNELS
IT WAS DESTINED HOWEVER THAT ALL MY PROFESSIONAL CAUTION SHOULD BE
WASTED FOR NEXT MORNING THE PROBLEM OBTRUDED ITSELF UPON US IN SUCH
A WAY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE IT AND OUR COUNTRY VISIT TOOK
A TURN WHICH NEITHER OF US COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED WE WERE AT
BREAKFAST WHEN THE COLONELS BUTLER RUSHED IN WITH ALL HIS PROPRIETY
SHAKEN OUT OF HIM
HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS SIR HE GASPED AT THE CUNNINGHAMS SIR
BURGLARY CRIED THE COLONEL WITH HIS COFFEECUP IN MIDAIR
MURDER
THE COLONEL WHISTLED BY JOVE SAID HE WHOS KILLED THEN THE
JP OR HIS SON
NEITHER SIR IT WAS WILLIAM THE COACHMAN SHOT THROUGH THE HEART
SIR AND NEVER SPOKE AGAIN
WHO SHOT HIM THEN
THE BURGLAR SIR HE WAS OFF LIKE A SHOT AND GOT CLEAN AWAY HED
JUST BROKE IN AT THE PANTRY WINDOW WHEN WILLIAM CAME ON HIM AND MET
HIS END IN SAVING HIS MASTERS PROPERTY
WHAT TIME
IT WAS LAST NIGHT SIR SOMEWHERE ABOUT TWELVE
AH THEN WELL STEP OVER AFTERWARDS SAID THE COLONEL COOLLY
SETTLING DOWN TO HIS BREAKFAST AGAIN ITS A BADDISH BUSINESS HE
ADDED WHEN THE BUTLER HAD GONE HES OUR LEADING MAN ABOUT HERE IS
OLD CUNNINGHAM AND A VERY DECENT FELLOW TOO HELL BE CUT UP OVER
THIS FOR THE MAN HAS BEEN IN HIS SERVICE FOR YEARS AND WAS A GOOD
SERVANT ITS EVIDENTLY THE SAME VILLAINS WHO BROKE INTO ACTONS
AND STOLE THAT VERY SINGULAR COLLECTION SAID HOLMES THOUGHTFULLY
PRECISELY
HUM IT MAY PROVE THE SIMPLEST MATTER IN THE WORLD BUT ALL THE SAME
AT FIRST GLANCE THIS IS JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS IS IT NOT A GANG OF
BURGLARS ACTING IN THE COUNTRY MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO VARY THE SCENE OF
THEIR OPERATIONS AND NOT TO CRACK TWO CRIBS IN THE SAME DISTRICT
WITHIN A FEW DAYS WHEN YOU SPOKE LAST NIGHT OF TAKING PRECAUTIONS I
REMEMBER THAT IT PASSED THROUGH MY MIND THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY THE
LAST PARISH IN ENGLAND TO WHICH THE THIEF OR THIEVES WOULD BE LIKELY
TO TURN THEIR ATTENTIONWHICH SHOWS THAT I HAVE STILL MUCH TO
LEARN
I FANCY ITS SOME LOCAL PRACTITIONER SAID THE COLONEL IN THAT
CASE OF COURSE ACTONS AND CUNNINGHAMS ARE JUST THE PLACES HE
WOULD GO FOR SINCE THEY ARE FAR THE LARGEST ABOUT HERE
AND RICHEST
WELL THEY OUGHT TO BE BUT THEYVE HAD A LAWSUIT FOR SOME YEARS
WHICH HAS SUCKED THE BLOOD OUT OF BOTH OF THEM I FANCY OLD ACTON
HAS SOME CLAIM ON HALF CUNNINGHAMS ESTATE AND THE LAWYERS HAVE BEEN
AT IT WITH BOTH HANDS
IF ITS A LOCAL VILLAIN THERE SHOULD NOT BE MUCH DIFFICULTY IN
RUNNING HIM DOWN SAID HOLMES WITH A YAWN ALL RIGHT WATSON I
DONT INTEND TO MEDDLE
INSPECTOR FORRESTER SIR SAID THE BUTLER THROWING OPEN THE DOOR
THE OFFICIAL A SMART KEENFACED YOUNG FELLOW STEPPED INTO THE
ROOM GOODMORNING COLONEL SAID HE I HOPE I DONT INTRUDE BUT
WE HEAR THAT MR HOLMES OF BAKER STREET IS HERE
THE COLONEL WAVED HIS HAND TOWARDS MY FRIEND AND THE INSPECTOR
BOWED
WE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS YOU WOULD CARE TO STEP ACROSS MR HOLMES
THE FATES ARE AGAINST YOU WATSON SAID HE LAUGHING WE WERE
CHATTING ABOUT THE MATTER WHEN YOU CAME IN INSPECTOR PERHAPS YOU
CAN LET US HAVE A FEW DETAILS AS HE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR IN THE
FAMILIAR ATTITUDE I KNEW THAT THE CASE WAS HOPELESS
WE HAD NO CLUE IN THE ACTON AFFAIR BUT HERE WE HAVE PLENTY TO GO
ON AND THERES NO DOUBT IT IS THE SAME PARTY IN EACH CASE THE MAN
WAS SEEN
AH
YES SIR BUT HE WAS OFF LIKE A DEER AFTER THE SHOT THAT KILLED POOR
WILLIAM KIRWAN WAS FIRED MR CUNNINGHAM SAW HIM FROM THE BEDROOM
WINDOW AND MR ALEC CUNNINGHAM SAW HIM FROM THE BACK PASSAGE IT WAS
QUARTER TO TWELVE WHEN THE ALARM BROKE OUT MR CUNNINGHAM HAD JUST
GOT INTO BED AND MR ALEC WAS SMOKING A PIPE IN HIS DRESSINGGOWN
THEY BOTH HEARD WILLIAM THE COACHMAN CALLING FOR HELP AND MR ALEC
RAN DOWN TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER THE BACK DOOR WAS OPEN AND AS
HE CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS HE SAW TWO MEN WRESTLING TOGETHER
OUTSIDE ONE OF THEM FIRED A SHOT THE OTHER DROPPED AND THE
MURDERER RUSHED ACROSS THE GARDEN AND OVER THE HEDGE MR CUNNINGHAM
LOOKING OUT OF HIS BEDROOM SAW THE FELLOW AS HE GAINED THE ROAD BUT
LOST SIGHT OF HIM AT ONCE MR ALEC STOPPED TO SEE IF HE COULD HELP
THE DYING MAN AND SO THE VILLAIN GOT CLEAN AWAY BEYOND THE FACT
THAT HE WAS A MIDDLESIZED MAN AND DRESSED IN SOME DARK STUFF WE
HAVE NO PERSONAL CLUE BUT WE ARE MAKING ENERGETIC INQUIRIES AND IF
HE IS A STRANGER WE SHALL SOON FIND HIM OUT
WHAT WAS THIS WILLIAM DOING THERE DID HE SAY ANYTHING BEFORE HE
DIED
NOT A WORD HE LIVES AT THE LODGE WITH HIS MOTHER AND AS HE WAS A
VERY FAITHFUL FELLOW WE IMAGINE THAT HE WALKED UP TO THE HOUSE WITH
THE INTENTION OF SEEING THAT ALL WAS RIGHT THERE OF COURSE THIS
ACTON BUSINESS HAS PUT EVERY ONE ON THEIR GUARD THE ROBBER MUST HAVE
JUST BURST OPEN THE DOORTHE LOCK HAS BEEN FORCEDWHEN WILLIAM CAME
UPON HIM
DID WILLIAM SAY ANYTHING TO HIS MOTHER BEFORE GOING OUT
SHE IS VERY OLD AND DEAF AND WE CAN GET NO INFORMATION FROM HER
THE SHOCK HAS MADE HER HALFWITTED BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS
NEVER VERY BRIGHT THERE IS ONE VERY IMPORTANT CIRCUMSTANCE HOWEVER
LOOK AT THIS
HE TOOK A SMALL PIECE OF TORN PAPER FROM A NOTEBOOK AND SPREAD IT
OUT UPON HIS KNEE
THIS WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE FINGER AND THUMB OF THE DEAD MAN IT
APPEARS TO BE A FRAGMENT TORN FROM A LARGER SHEET YOU WILL OBSERVE
THAT THE HOUR MENTIONED UPON IT IS THE VERY TIME AT WHICH THE POOR
FELLOW MET HIS FATE YOU SEE THAT HIS MURDERER MIGHT HAVE TORN THE
REST OF THE SHEET FROM HIM OR HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THIS FRAGMENT FROM
THE MURDERER IT READS ALMOST AS THOUGH IT WERE AN APPOINTMENT
HOLMES TOOK UP THE SCRAP OF PAPER A FACSIMILE OF WHICH IS HERE
REPRODUCED
PICTURE SCRAP SHOWING THE WORDS AT QUARTER TO TWELVE LEARN WHAT
MAY BE PRESUMING THAT IT IS AN APPOINTMENT CONTINUED THE INSPECTOR IT
IS OF COURSE A CONCEIVABLE THEORY THAT THIS WILLIAM KIRWANTHOUGH HE
HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING AN HONEST MAN MAY HAVE BEEN IN LEAGUE
WITH THE THIEF HE MAY HAVE MET HIM THERE MAY EVEN HAVE HELPED HIM
TO BREAK IN THE DOOR AND THEN THEY MAY HAVE FALLEN OUT BETWEEN
THEMSELVES
THIS WRITING IS OF EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST SAID HOLMES WHO HAD
BEEN EXAMINING IT WITH INTENSE CONCENTRATION THESE ARE MUCH DEEPER
WATERS THAN I HAD THOUGHT HE SANK HIS HEAD UPON HIS HANDS WHILE
THE INSPECTOR SMILED AT THE EFFECT WHICH HIS CASE HAD HAD UPON THE
FAMOUS LONDON SPECIALIST
YOUR LAST REMARK SAID HOLMES PRESENTLY AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF
THERE BEING AN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE BURGLAR AND THE SERVANT AND
THIS BEING A NOTE OF APPOINTMENT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER IS AN
INGENIOUS AND NOT ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE SUPPOSITION BUT THIS WRITING
OPENS UP HE SANK HIS HEAD INTO HIS HANDS AGAIN AND REMAINED FOR
SOME MINUTES IN THE DEEPEST THOUGHT WHEN HE RAISED HIS FACE AGAIN I
WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT HIS CHEEK WAS TINGED WITH COLOR AND HIS
EYES AS BRIGHT AS BEFORE HIS ILLNESS HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET WITH ALL
HIS OLD ENERGY
ILL TELL YOU WHAT SAID HE I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A QUIET LITTLE
GLANCE INTO THE DETAILS OF THIS CASE THERE IS SOMETHING IN IT WHICH
FASCINATES ME EXTREMELY IF YOU WILL PERMIT ME COLONEL I WILL LEAVE
MY FRIEND WATSON AND YOU AND I WILL STEP ROUND WITH THE INSPECTOR TO
TEST THE TRUTH OF ONE OR TWO LITTLE FANCIES OF MINE I WILL BE WITH
YOU AGAIN IN HALF AN HOUR
AN HOUR AND HALF HAD ELAPSED BEFORE THE INSPECTOR RETURNED ALONE
MR HOLMES IS WALKING UP AND DOWN IN THE FIELD OUTSIDE SAID HE
HE WANTS US ALL FOUR TO GO UP TO THE HOUSE TOGETHER
TO MR CUNNINGHAMS
YES SIR
WHAT FOR
THE INSPECTOR SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I DONT QUITE KNOW SIR
BETWEEN OURSELVES I THINK MR HOLMES HAD NOT QUITE GOT OVER HIS
ILLNESS YET HES BEEN BEHAVING VERY QUEERLY AND HE IS VERY MUCH
EXCITED
I DONT THINK YOU NEED ALARM YOURSELF SAID I I HAVE USUALLY
FOUND THAT THERE WAS METHOD IN HIS MADNESS
SOME FOLKS MIGHT SAY THERE WAS MADNESS IN HIS METHOD MUTTERED THE
INSPECTOR BUT HES ALL ON FIRE TO START COLONEL SO WE HAD BEST GO
OUT IF YOU ARE READY
WE FOUND HOLMES PACING UP AND DOWN IN THE FIELD HIS CHIN SUNK UPON
HIS BREAST AND HIS HANDS THRUST INTO HIS TROUSERS POCKETS
THE MATTER GROWS IN INTEREST SAID HE WATSON YOUR COUNTRYTRIP
HAS BEEN A DISTINCT SUCCESS I HAVE HAD A CHARMING MORNING
YOU HAVE BEEN UP TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME I UNDERSTAND SAID THE
COLONEL
YES THE INSPECTOR AND I HAVE MADE QUITE A LITTLE RECONNAISSANCE
TOGETHER
ANY SUCCESS
WELL WE HAVE SEEN SOME VERY INTERESTING THINGS ILL TELL YOU WHAT
WE DID AS WE WALK FIRST OF ALL WE SAW THE BODY OF THIS UNFORTUNATE
MAN HE CERTAINLY DIED FROM A REVOLVER WOUND AS REPORTED
HAD YOU DOUBTED IT THEN
OH IT IS AS WELL TO TEST EVERYTHING OUR INSPECTION WAS NOT WASTED
WE THEN HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH MR CUNNINGHAM AND HIS SON WHO WERE
ABLE TO POINT OUT THE EXACT SPOT WHERE THE MURDERER HAD BROKEN
THROUGH THE GARDENHEDGE IN HIS FLIGHT THAT WAS OF GREAT INTEREST
NATURALLY
THEN WE HAD A LOOK AT THIS POOR FELLOWS MOTHER WE COULD GET NO
INFORMATION FROM HER HOWEVER AS SHE IS VERY OLD AND FEEBLE
AND WHAT IS THE RESULT OF YOUR INVESTIGATIONS
THE CONVICTION THAT THE CRIME IS A VERY PECULIAR ONE PERHAPS OUR
VISIT NOW MAY DO SOMETHING TO MAKE IT LESS OBSCURE I THINK THAT WE
ARE BOTH AGREED INSPECTOR THAT THE FRAGMENT OF PAPER IN THE DEAD
MANS HAND BEARING AS IT DOES THE VERY HOUR OF HIS DEATH WRITTEN
UPON IT IS OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE
IT SHOULD GIVE A CLUE MR HOLMES
IT DOES GIVE A CLUE WHOEVER WROTE THAT NOTE WAS THE MAN WHO BROUGHT
WILLIAM KIRWAN OUT OF HIS BED AT THAT HOUR BUT WHERE IS THE REST OF
THAT SHEET OF PAPER
I EXAMINED THE GROUND CAREFULLY IN THE HOPE OF FINDING IT SAID THE
INSPECTOR
IT WAS TORN OUT OF THE DEAD MANS HAND WHY WAS SOME ONE SO ANXIOUS
TO GET POSSESSION OF IT BECAUSE IT INCRIMINATED HIM AND WHAT WOULD
HE DO WITH IT THRUST IT INTO HIS POCKET MOST LIKELY NEVER NOTICING
THAT A CORNER OF IT HAD BEEN LEFT IN THE GRIP OF THE CORPSE IF WE
COULD GET THE REST OF THAT SHEET IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE
GONE A LONG WAY TOWARDS SOLVING THE MYSTERY
YES BUT HOW CAN WE GET AT THE CRIMINALS POCKET BEFORE WE CATCH THE
CRIMINAL
WELL WELL IT WAS WORTH THINKING OVER THEN THERE IS ANOTHER
OBVIOUS POINT THE NOTE WAS SENT TO WILLIAM THE MAN WHO WROTE IT
COULD NOT HAVE TAKEN IT OTHERWISE OF COURSE HE MIGHT HAVE
DELIVERED HIS OWN MESSAGE BY WORD OF MOUTH WHO BROUGHT THE NOTE
THEN OR DID IT COME THROUGH THE POST
I HAVE MADE INQUIRIES SAID THE INSPECTOR WILLIAM RECEIVED A
LETTER BY THE AFTERNOON POST YESTERDAY THE ENVELOPE WAS DESTROYED BY
HIM
EXCELLENT CRIED HOLMES CLAPPING THE INSPECTOR ON THE BACK
YOUVE SEEN THE POSTMAN IT IS A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH YOU WELL
HERE IS THE LODGE AND IF YOU WILL COME UP COLONEL I WILL SHOW YOU
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
WE PASSED THE PRETTY COTTAGE WHERE THE MURDERED MAN HAD LIVED AND
WALKED UP AN OAKLINED AVENUE TO THE FINE OLD QUEEN ANNE HOUSE WHICH
BEARS THE DATE OF MALPLAQUET UPON THE LINTEL OF THE DOOR HOLMES AND
THE INSPECTOR LED US ROUND IT UNTIL WE CAME TO THE SIDE GATE WHICH
IS SEPARATED BY A STRETCH OF GARDEN FROM THE HEDGE WHICH LINES THE
ROAD A CONSTABLE WAS STANDING AT THE KITCHEN DOOR
THROW THE DOOR OPEN OFFICER SAID HOLMES NOW IT WAS ON THOSE
STAIRS THAT YOUNG MR CUNNINGHAM STOOD AND SAW THE TWO MEN STRUGGLING
JUST WHERE WE ARE OLD MR CUNNINGHAM WAS AT THAT WINDOWTHE SECOND
ON THE LEFTAND HE SAW THE FELLOW GET AWAY JUST TO THE LEFT OF THAT
BUSH SO DID THE SON THEY ARE BOTH SURE OF IT ON ACCOUNT OF THE
BUSH THEN MR ALEC RAN OUT AND KNELT BESIDE THE WOUNDED MAN THE
GROUND IS VERY HARD YOU SEE AND THERE ARE NO MARKS TO GUIDE US AS
HE SPOKE TWO MEN CAME DOWN THE GARDEN PATH FROM ROUND THE ANGLE OF
THE HOUSE THE ONE WAS AN ELDERLY MAN WITH A STRONG DEEPLINED
HEAVYEYED FACE THE OTHER A DASHING YOUNG FELLOW WHOSE BRIGHT
SMILING EXPRESSION AND SHOWY DRESS WERE IN STRANGE CONTRAST WITH THE
BUSINESS WHICH HAD BROUGHT US THERE
STILL AT IT THEN SAID HE TO HOLMES I THOUGHT YOU LONDONERS WERE
NEVER AT FAULT YOU DONT SEEM TO BE SO VERY QUICK AFTER ALL
AH YOU MUST GIVE US A LITTLE TIME SAID HOLMES GOODHUMOREDLY
YOULL WANT IT SAID YOUNG ALEC CUNNINGHAM WHY I DONT SEE THAT
WE HAVE ANY CLUE AT ALL
THERES ONLY ONE ANSWERED THE INSPECTOR WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE
COULD ONLY FINDGOOD HEAVENS MR HOLMES WHAT IS THE MATTER
MY POOR FRIENDS FACE HAD SUDDENLY ASSUMED THE MOST DREADFUL
EXPRESSION HIS EYES ROLLED UPWARDS HIS FEATURES WRITHED IN AGONY
AND WITH A SUPPRESSED GROAN HE DROPPED ON HIS FACE UPON THE GROUND
HORRIFIED AT THE SUDDENNESS AND SEVERITY OF THE ATTACK WE CARRIED
HIM INTO THE KITCHEN WHERE HE LAY BACK IN A LARGE CHAIR AND
BREATHED HEAVILY FOR SOME MINUTES FINALLY WITH A SHAMEFACED APOLOGY
FOR HIS WEAKNESS HE ROSE ONCE MORE
WATSON WOULD TELL YOU THAT I HAVE ONLY JUST RECOVERED FROM A SEVERE
ILLNESS HE EXPLAINED I AM LIABLE TO THESE SUDDEN NERVOUS
ATTACKS
SHALL I SEND YOU HOME IN MY TRAP ASKED OLD CUNNINGHAM
WELL SINCE I AM HERE THERE IS ONE POINT ON WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TO
FEEL SURE WE CAN VERY EASILY VERIFY IT
WHAT WAS IT
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT THE ARRIVAL OF
THIS POOR FELLOW WILLIAM WAS NOT BEFORE BUT AFTER THE ENTRANCE OF
THE BURGLARY INTO THE HOUSE YOU APPEAR TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT
ALTHOUGH THE DOOR WAS FORCED THE ROBBER NEVER GOT IN
I FANCY THAT IS QUITE OBVIOUS SAID MR CUNNINGHAM GRAVELY WHY
MY SON ALEC HAD NOT YET GONE TO BED AND HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE
HEARD ANY ONE MOVING ABOUT
WHERE WAS HE SITTING
I WAS SMOKING IN MY DRESSINGROOM
WHICH WINDOW IS THAT
THE LAST ON THE LEFT NEXT MY FATHERS
BOTH OF YOUR LAMPS WERE LIT OF COURSE
UNDOUBTEDLY
THERE ARE SOME VERY SINGULAR POINTS HERE SAID HOLMES SMILING IS
IT NOT EXTRAORDINARY THAT A BURGLARYAND A BURGLAR WHO HAD HAD SOME
PREVIOUS EXPERIENCESHOULD DELIBERATELY BREAK INTO A HOUSE AT A TIME
WHEN HE COULD SEE FROM THE LIGHTS THAT TWO OF THE FAMILY WERE STILL
AFOOT
HE MUST HAVE BEEN A COOL HAND
WELL OF COURSE IF THE CASE WERE NOT AN ODD ONE WE SHOULD NOT HAVE
BEEN DRIVEN TO ASK YOU FOR AN EXPLANATION SAID YOUNG MR ALEC BUT
AS TO YOUR IDEAS THAT THE MAN HAD ROBBED THE HOUSE BEFORE WILLIAM
TACKLED HIM I THINK IT A MOST ABSURD NOTION WOULDNT WE HAVE FOUND
THE PLACE DISARRANGED AND MISSED THE THINGS WHICH HE HAD TAKEN
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE THINGS WERE SAID HOLMES YOU MUST REMEMBER
THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH A BURGLAR WHO IS A VERY PECULIAR FELLOW AND
WHO APPEARS TO WORK ON LINES OF HIS OWN LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT THE
QUEER LOT OF THINGS WHICH HE TOOK FROM ACTONSWHAT WAS ITA BALL
OF STRING A LETTERWEIGHT AND I DONT KNOW WHAT OTHER ODDS AND
ENDS
WELL WE ARE QUITE IN YOUR HANDS MR HOLMES SAID OLD CUNNINGHAM
ANYTHING WHICH YOU OR THE INSPECTOR MAY SUGGEST WILL MOST CERTAINLY
BE DONE
IN THE FIRST PLACE SAID HOLMES I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO OFFER A
REWARDCOMING FROM YOURSELF FOR THE OFFICIALS MAY TAKE A LITTLE
TIME BEFORE THEY WOULD AGREE UPON THE SUM AND THESE THINGS CANNOT BE
DONE TOO PROMPTLY I HAVE JOTTED DOWN THE FORM HERE IF YOU WOULD NOT
MIND SIGNING IT FIFTY POUND WAS QUITE ENOUGH I THOUGHT
I WOULD WILLINGLY GIVE FIVE HUNDRED SAID THE JP TAKING THE SLIP
OF PAPER AND THE PENCIL WHICH HOLMES HANDED TO HIM THIS IS NOT
QUITE CORRECT HOWEVER HE ADDED GLANCING OVER THE DOCUMENT
I WROTE IT RATHER HURRIEDLY
YOU SEE YOU BEGIN WHEREAS AT ABOUT A QUARTER TO ONE ON TUESDAY
MORNING AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE AND SO ON IT WAS AT A QUARTER TO
TWELVE AS A MATTER OF FACT
I WAS PAINED AT THE MISTAKE FOR I KNEW HOW KEENLY HOLMES WOULD FEEL
ANY SLIP OF THE KIND IT WAS HIS SPECIALTY TO BE ACCURATE AS TO FACT
BUT HIS RECENT ILLNESS HAD SHAKEN HIM AND THIS ONE LITTLE INCIDENT
WAS ENOUGH TO SHOW ME THAT HE WAS STILL FAR FROM BEING HIMSELF HE
WAS OBVIOUSLY EMBARRASSED FOR AN INSTANT WHILE THE INSPECTOR RAISED
HIS EYEBROWS AND ALEC CUNNINGHAM BURST INTO A LAUGH THE OLD
GENTLEMAN CORRECTED THE MISTAKE HOWEVER AND HANDED THE PAPER BACK
TO HOLMES
GET IT PRINTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE SAID I THINK YOUR IDEA IS
AN EXCELLENT ONE
HOLMES PUT THE SLIP OF PAPER CAREFULLY AWAY INTO HIS POCKETBOOK
AND NOW SAID HE IT REALLY WOULD BE A GOOD THING THAT WE SHOULD
ALL GO OVER THE HOUSE TOGETHER AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT THIS RATHER
ERRATIC BURGLAR DID NOT AFTER ALL CARRY ANYTHING AWAY WITH HIM
BEFORE ENTERING HOLMES MADE AN EXAMINATION OF THE DOOR WHICH HAD
BEEN FORCED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT A CHISEL OR STRONG KNIFE HAD BEEN
THRUST IN AND THE LOCK FORCED BACK WITH IT WE COULD SEE THE MARKS
IN THE WOOD WHERE IT HAD BEEN PUSHED IN
YOU DONT USE BARS THEN HE ASKED
WE HAVE NEVER FOUND IT NECESSARY
YOU DONT KEEP A DOG
YES BUT HE IS CHAINED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE
WHEN DO THE SERVANTS GO TO BED
ABOUT TEN
I UNDERSTAND THAT WILLIAM WAS USUALLY IN BED ALSO AT THAT HOUR
YES
IT IS SINGULAR THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN UP
NOW I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD IF YOU WOULD HAVE THE KINDNESS TO SHOW US
OVER THE HOUSE MR CUNNINGHAM
A STONEFLAGGED PASSAGE WITH THE KITCHENS BRANCHING AWAY FROM IT
LED BY A WOODEN STAIRCASE DIRECTLY TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE HOUSE
IT CAME OUT UPON THE LANDING OPPOSITE TO A SECOND MORE ORNAMENTAL
STAIR WHICH CAME UP FROM THE FRONT HALL OUT OF THIS LANDING OPENED
THE DRAWINGROOM AND SEVERAL BEDROOMS INCLUDING THOSE OF MR
CUNNINGHAM AND HIS SON HOLMES WALKED SLOWLY TAKING KEEN NOTE OF THE
ARCHITECTURE OF THE HOUSE I COULD TELL FROM HIS EXPRESSION THAT HE
WAS ON A HOT SCENT AND YET I COULD NOT IN THE LEAST IMAGINE IN WHAT
DIRECTION HIS INFERENCES WERE LEADING HIM
MY GOOD SIR SAID MR CUNNINGHAM WITH SOME IMPATIENCE THIS IS
SURELY VERY UNNECESSARY THAT IS MY ROOM AT THE END OF THE STAIRS
AND MY SONS IS THE ONE BEYOND IT I LEAVE IT TO YOUR JUDGMENT
WHETHER IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE THIEF TO HAVE COME UP HERE WITHOUT
DISTURBING US
YOU MUST TRY ROUND AND GET ON A FRESH SCENT I FANCY SAID THE SON
WITH A RATHER MALICIOUS SMILE
STILL I MUST ASK YOU TO HUMOR ME A LITTLE FURTHER I SHOULD LIKE
FOR EXAMPLE TO SEE HOW FAR THE WINDOWS OF THE BEDROOMS COMMAND THE
FRONT THIS I UNDERSTAND IS YOUR SONS ROOMHE PUSHED OPEN THE
DOORAND THAT I PRESUME IS THE DRESSINGROOM IN WHICH HE SAT
SMOKING WHEN THE ALARM WAS GIVEN WHERE DOES THE WINDOW OF THAT LOOK
OUT TO HE STEPPED ACROSS THE BEDROOM PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND
GLANCED ROUND THE OTHER CHAMBER
I HOPE THAT YOU ARE SATISFIED NOW SAID MR CUNNINGHAM TARTLY
THANK YOU I THINK I HAVE SEEN ALL THAT I WISHED
THEN IF IT IS REALLY NECESSARY WE CAN GO INTO MY ROOM
IF IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE
THE JP SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND LED THE WAY INTO HIS OWN
CHAMBER WHICH WAS A PLAINLY FURNISHED AND COMMONPLACE ROOM AS WE
MOVED ACROSS IT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WINDOW HOLMES FELL BACK
UNTIL HE AND I WERE THE LAST OF THE GROUP NEAR THE FOOT OF THE BED
STOOD A DISH OF ORANGES AND A CARAFE OF WATER AS WE PASSED IT
HOLMES TO MY UNUTTERABLE ASTONISHMENT LEANED OVER IN FRONT OF ME
AND DELIBERATELY KNOCKED THE WHOLE THING OVER THE GLASS SMASHED INTO
A THOUSAND PIECES AND THE FRUIT ROLLED ABOUT INTO EVERY CORNER OF THE
ROOM
YOUVE DONE IT NOW WATSON SAID HE COOLLY A PRETTY MESS YOUVE
MADE OF THE CARPET
I STOOPED IN SOME CONFUSION AND BEGAN TO PICK UP THE FRUIT
UNDERSTANDING FOR SOME REASON MY COMPANION DESIRED ME TO TAKE THE
BLAME UPON MYSELF THE OTHERS DID THE SAME AND SET THE TABLE ON ITS
LEGS AGAIN
HULLO CRIED THE INSPECTOR WHERES HE GOT TO
HOLMES HAD DISAPPEARED
WAIT HERE AN INSTANT SAID YOUNG ALEC CUNNINGHAM THE FELLOW IS
OFF HIS HEAD IN MY OPINION COME WITH ME FATHER AND SEE WHERE HE
HAS GOT TO
THEY RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING THE INSPECTOR THE COLONEL AND
ME STARING AT EACH OTHER
PON MY WORD I AM INCLINED TO AGREE WITH MASTER ALEC SAID THE
OFFICIAL IT MAY BE THE EFFECT OF THIS ILLNESS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT
HIS WORDS WERE CUT SHORT BY A SUDDEN SCREAM OF HELP HELP MURDER
WITH A THRILL I RECOGNISED THE VOICE AS THAT OF MY FRIEND I RUSHED
MADLY FROM THE ROOM ON TO THE LANDING THE CRIES WHICH HAD SUNK DOWN
INTO A HOARSE INARTICULATE SHOUTING CAME FROM THE ROOM WHICH WE HAD
FIRST VISITED I DASHED IN AND ON INTO THE DRESSINGROOM BEYOND THE
TWO CUNNINGHAMS WERE BENDING OVER THE PROSTRATE FIGURE OF SHERLOCK
HOLMES THE YOUNGER CLUTCHING HIS THROAT WITH BOTH HANDS WHILE THE
ELDER SEEMED TO BE TWISTING ONE OF HIS WRISTS IN AN INSTANT THE
THREE OF US HAD TORN THEM AWAY FROM HIM AND HOLMES STAGGERED TO HIS
FEET VERY PALE AND EVIDENTLY GREATLY EXHAUSTED
ARREST THESE MEN INSPECTOR HE GASPED
ON WHAT CHARGE
THAT OF MURDERING THEIR COACHMAN WILLIAM KIRWAN
THE INSPECTOR STARED ABOUT HIM IN BEWILDERMENT OH COME NOW MR
HOLMES SAID HE AT LAST IM SURE YOU DONT REALLY MEAN TO
TUT MAN LOOK AT THEIR FACES CRIED HOLMES CURTLY
NEVER CERTAINLY HAVE I SEEN A PLAINER CONFESSION OF GUILT UPON
HUMAN COUNTENANCES THE OLDER MAN SEEMED NUMBED AND DAZED WITH A
HEAVY SULLEN EXPRESSION UPON HIS STRONGLYMARKED FACE THE SON ON
THE OTHER HAND HAD DROPPED ALL THAT JAUNTY DASHING STYLE WHICH HAD
CHARACTERIZED HIM AND THE FEROCITY OF A DANGEROUS WILD BEAST GLEAMED
IN HIS DARK EYES AND DISTORTED HIS HANDSOME FEATURES THE INSPECTOR
SAID NOTHING BUT STEPPING TO THE DOOR HE BLEW HIS WHISTLE TWO OF
HIS CONSTABLES CAME AT THE CALL
I HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE MR CUNNINGHAM SAID HE I TRUST THAT THIS
MAY ALL PROVE TO BE AN ABSURD MISTAKE BUT YOU CAN SEE THATAH
WOULD YOU DROP IT HE STRUCK OUT WITH HIS HAND AND A REVOLVER
WHICH THE YOUNGER MAN WAS IN THE ACT OF COCKING CLATTERED DOWN UPON
THE FLOOR
KEEP THAT SAID HOLMES QUIETLY PUTTING HIS FOOT UPON IT YOU WILL
FIND IT USEFUL AT THE TRIAL BUT THIS IS WHAT WE REALLY WANTED HE
HELD UP A LITTLE CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER
THE REMAINDER OF THE SHEET CRIED THE INSPECTOR
PRECISELY
AND WHERE WAS IT
WHERE I WAS SURE IT MUST BE ILL MAKE THE WHOLE MATTER CLEAR TO YOU
PRESENTLY I THINK COLONEL THAT YOU AND WATSON MIGHT RETURN NOW
AND I WILL BE WITH YOU AGAIN IN AN HOUR AT THE FURTHEST THE
INSPECTOR AND I MUST HAVE A WORD WITH THE PRISONERS BUT YOU WILL
CERTAINLY SEE ME BACK AT LUNCHEON TIME
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD FOR ABOUT ONE OCLOCK HE
REJOINED US IN THE COLONELS SMOKINGROOM HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A
LITTLE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WHO WAS INTRODUCED TO ME AS THE MR ACTON
WHOSE HOUSE HAD BEEN THE SCENE OF THE ORIGINAL BURGLARY
I WISHED MR ACTON TO BE PRESENT WHILE I DEMONSTRATED THIS SMALL
MATTER TO YOU SAID HOLMES FOR IT IS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD TAKE A
KEEN INTEREST IN THE DETAILS I AM AFRAID MY DEAR COLONEL THAT YOU
MUST REGRET THE HOUR THAT YOU TOOK IN SUCH A STORMY PETREL AS I AM
ON THE CONTRARY ANSWERED THE COLONEL WARMLY I CONSIDER IT THE
GREATEST PRIVILEGE TO HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO STUDY YOUR METHODS OF
WORKING I CONFESS THAT THEY QUITE SURPASS MY EXPECTATIONS AND THAT
I AM UTTERLY UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR YOUR RESULT I HAVE NOT YET SEEN
THE VESTIGE OF A CLUE
I AM AFRAID THAT MY EXPLANATION MAY DISILLUSION YOU BUT IT HAS
ALWAYS BEEN MY HABIT TO HIDE NONE OF MY METHODS EITHER FROM MY
FRIEND WATSON OR FROM ANY ONE WHO MIGHT TAKE AN INTELLIGENT INTEREST
IN THEM BUT FIRST AS I AM RATHER SHAKEN BY THE KNOCKING ABOUT
WHICH I HAD IN THE DRESSINGROOM I THINK THAT I SHALL HELP MYSELF TO
A DASH OF YOUR BRANDY COLONEL MY STRENGTH HAD BEEN RATHER TRIED OF
LATE
I TRUST THAT YOU HAD NO MORE OF THOSE NERVOUS ATTACKS
SHERLOCK HOLMES LAUGHED HEARTILY WE WILL COME TO THAT IN ITS TURN
SAID HE I WILL LAY AN ACCOUNT OF THE CASE BEFORE YOU IN ITS DUE
ORDER SHOWING YOU THE VARIOUS POINTS WHICH GUIDED ME IN MY DECISION
PRAY INTERRUPT ME IF THERE IS ANY INFERENCE WHICH IS NOT PERFECTLY
CLEAR TO YOU
IT IS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE IN THE ART OF DETECTION TO BE ABLE
TO RECOGNIZE OUT OF A NUMBER OF FACTS WHICH ARE INCIDENTAL AND
WHICH VITAL OTHERWISE YOUR ENERGY AND ATTENTION MUST BE DISSIPATED
INSTEAD OF BEING CONCENTRATED NOW IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NOT THE
SLIGHTEST DOUBT IN MY MIND FROM THE FIRST THAT THE KEY OF THE WHOLE
MATTER MUST BE LOOKED FOR IN THE SCRAP OF PAPER IN THE DEAD MANS
HAND
BEFORE GOING INTO THIS I WOULD DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT
THAT IF ALEC CUNNINGHAMS NARRATIVE WAS CORRECT AND IF THE
ASSAILANT AFTER SHOOTING WILLIAM KIRWAN HAD INSTANTLY FLED THEN IT
OBVIOUSLY COULD NOT BE HE WHO TORE THE PAPER FROM THE DEAD MANS
HAND BUT IF IT WAS NOT HE IT MUST HAVE BEEN ALEC CUNNINGHAM
HIMSELF FOR BY THE TIME THAT THE OLD MAN HAD DESCENDED SEVERAL
SERVANTS WERE UPON THE SCENE THE POINT IS A SIMPLE ONE BUT THE
INSPECTOR HAD OVERLOOKED IT BECAUSE HE HAD STARTED WITH THE
SUPPOSITION THAT THESE COUNTY MAGNATES HAD HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
MATTER NOW I MAKE A POINT OF NEVER HAVING ANY PREJUDICES AND OF
FOLLOWING DOCILELY WHEREVER FACT MAY LEAD ME AND SO IN THE VERY
FIRST STAGE OF THE INVESTIGATION I FOUND MYSELF LOOKING A LITTLE
ASKANCE AT THE PART WHICH HAD BEEN PLAYED BY MR ALEC CUNNINGHAM
AND NOW I MADE A VERY CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE CORNER OF PAPER
WHICH THE INSPECTOR HAD SUBMITTED TO US IT WAS AT ONCE CLEAR TO ME
THAT IT FORMED PART OF A VERY REMARKABLE DOCUMENT HERE IT IS DO YOU
NOT NOW OBSERVED SOMETHING VERY SUGGESTIVE ABOUT IT
IT HAS A VERY IRREGULAR LOOK SAID THE COLONEL
MY DEAR SIR CRIED HOLMES THERE CANNOT BE THE LEAST DOUBT IN THE
WORLD THAT IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY TWO PERSONS DOING ALTERNATE WORDS
WHEN I DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE STRONG TS OF AT AND TO AND
ASK YOU TO COMPARE THEM WITH THE WEAK ONES OF QUARTER AND TWELVE
YOU WILL INSTANTLY RECOGNIZE THE FACT A VERY BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THESE
FOUR WORDS WOULD ENABLE YOU TO SAY WITH THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE THAT
THE LEARN AND THE MAYBE ARE WRITTEN IN THE STRONGER HAND AND THE
WHAT IN THE WEAKER
BY JOVE ITS AS CLEAR AS DAY CRIED THE COLONEL WHY ON EARTH
SHOULD TWO MEN WRITE A LETTER IN SUCH A FASHION
OBVIOUSLY THE BUSINESS WAS A BAD ONE AND ONE OF THE MEN WHO
DISTRUSTED THE OTHER WAS DETERMINED THAT WHATEVER WAS DONE EACH
SHOULD HAVE AN EQUAL HAND IN IT NOW OF THE TWO MEN IT IS CLEAR
THAT THE ONE WHO WROTE THE AT AND TO WAS THE RINGLEADER
HOW DO YOU GET AT THAT
WE MIGHT DEDUCE IT FROM THE MERE CHARACTER OF THE ONE HAND AS
COMPARED WITH THE OTHER BUT WE HAVE MORE ASSURED REASONS THAN THAT
FOR SUPPOSING IT IF YOU EXAMINE THIS SCRAP WITH ATTENTION YOU WILL
COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE MAN WITH THE STRONGER HAND WROTE ALL
HIS WORDS FIRST LEAVING BLANKS FOR THE OTHER TO FILL UP THESE
BLANKS WERE NOT ALWAYS SUFFICIENT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SECOND
MAN HAD A SQUEEZE TO FIT HIS QUARTER IN BETWEEN THE AT AND THE
TO SHOWING THAT THE LATTER WERE ALREADY WRITTEN THE MAN WHO WROTE
ALL HIS WORDS FIRST IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN WHO PLANNED THE AFFAIR
EXCELLENT CRIED MR ACTON
BUT VERY SUPERFICIAL SAID HOLMES WE COME NOW HOWEVER TO A
POINT WHICH IS OF IMPORTANCE YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT THE DEDUCTION
OF A MANS AGE FROM HIS WRITING IS ONE WHICH HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO
CONSIDERABLE ACCURACY BY EXPERTS IN NORMAL CASES ONE CAN PLACE A MAN
IN HIS TRUE DECADE WITH TOLERABLE CONFIDENCE I SAY NORMAL CASES
BECAUSE ILLHEALTH AND PHYSICAL WEAKNESS REPRODUCE THE SIGNS OF OLD
AGE EVEN WHEN THE INVALID IS A YOUTH IN THIS CASE LOOKING AT THE
BOLD STRONG HAND OF THE ONE AND THE RATHER BROKENBACKED APPEARANCE
OF THE OTHER WHICH STILL RETAINS ITS LEGIBILITY ALTHOUGH THE TS
HAVE BEGUN TO LOSE THEIR CROSSING WE CAN SAY THAT THE ONE WAS A
YOUNG MAN AND THE OTHER WAS ADVANCED IN YEARS WITHOUT BEING
POSITIVELY DECREPIT
EXCELLENT CRIED MR ACTON AGAIN
THERE IS A FURTHER POINT HOWEVER WHICH IS SUBTLER AND OF GREATER
INTEREST THERE IS SOMETHING IN COMMON BETWEEN THESE HANDS THEY
BELONG TO MEN WHO ARE BLOODRELATIVES IT MAY BE MOST OBVIOUS TO YOU
IN THE GREEK ES BUT TO ME THERE ARE MANY SMALL POINTS WHICH
INDICATE THE SAME THING I HAVE NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT A FAMILY
MANNERISM CAN BE TRACED IN THESE TWO SPECIMENS OF WRITING I AM ONLY
OF COURSE GIVING YOU THE LEADING RESULTS NOW OF MY EXAMINATION OF
THE PAPER THERE WERE TWENTYTHREE OTHER DEDUCTIONS WHICH WOULD BE OF
MORE INTEREST TO EXPERTS THAN TO YOU THEY ALL TENDED TO DEEPEN THE
IMPRESSION UPON MY MIND THAT THE CUNNINGHAMS FATHER AND SON HAD
WRITTEN THIS LETTER
HAVING GOT SO FAR MY NEXT STEP WAS OF COURSE TO EXAMINE INTO THE
DETAILS OF THE CRIME AND TO SEE HOW FAR THEY WOULD HELP US I WENT
UP TO THE HOUSE WITH THE INSPECTOR AND SAW ALL THAT WAS TO BE SEEN
THE WOUND UPON THE DEAD MAN WAS AS I WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE WITH
ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE FIRED FROM A REVOLVER AT THE DISTANCE OF
SOMETHING OVER FOUR YARDS THERE WAS NO POWDERBLACKENING ON THE
CLOTHES EVIDENTLY THEREFORE ALEC CUNNINGHAM HAD LIED WHEN HE SAID
THAT THE TWO MEN WERE STRUGGLING WHEN THE SHOT WAS FIRED AGAIN BOTH
FATHER AND SON AGREED AS TO THE PLACE WHERE THE MAN ESCAPED INTO THE
ROAD AT THAT POINT HOWEVER AS IT HAPPENS THERE IS A BROADISH
DITCH MOIST AT THE BOTTOM AS THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF BOOTMARKS
ABOUT THIS DITCH I WAS ABSOLUTELY SURE NOT ONLY THAT THE CUNNINGHAMS
HAD AGAIN LIED BUT THAT THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANY UNKNOWN MAN UPON
THE SCENE AT ALL
AND NOW I HAVE TO CONSIDER THE MOTIVE OF THIS SINGULAR CRIME TO GET
AT THIS I ENDEAVORED FIRST OF ALL TO SOLVE THE REASON OF THE
ORIGINAL BURGLARY AT MR ACTONS I UNDERSTOOD FROM SOMETHING WHICH
THE COLONEL TOLD US THAT A LAWSUIT HAD BEEN GOING ON BETWEEN YOU
MR ACTON AND THE CUNNINGHAMS OF COURSE IT INSTANTLY OCCURRED TO
ME THAT THEY HAD BROKEN INTO YOUR LIBRARY WITH THE INTENTION OF
GETTING AT SOME DOCUMENT WHICH MIGHT BE OF IMPORTANCE IN THE CASE
PRECISELY SO SAID MR ACTON THERE CAN BE NO POSSIBLE DOUBT AS TO
THEIR INTENTIONS I HAVE THE CLEAREST CLAIM UPON HALF OF THEIR
PRESENT ESTATE AND IF THEY COULD HAVE FOUND A SINGLE PAPERWHICH
FORTUNATELY WAS IN THE STRONGBOX OF MY SOLICITORSTHEY WOULD
UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE CRIPPLED OUR CASE
THERE YOU ARE SAID HOLMES SMILING IT WAS A DANGEROUS RECKLESS
ATTEMPT IN WHICH I SEEM TO TRACE THE INFLUENCE OF YOUNG ALEC HAVING
FOUND NOTHING THEY TRIED TO DIVERT SUSPICION BY MAKING IT APPEAR TO
BE AN ORDINARY BURGLARY TO WHICH END THEY CARRIED OFF WHATEVER THEY
COULD LAY THEIR HANDS UPON THAT IS ALL CLEAR ENOUGH BUT THERE WAS
MUCH THAT WAS STILL OBSCURE WHAT I WANTED ABOVE ALL WAS TO GET THE
MISSING PART OF THAT NOTE I WAS CERTAIN THAT ALEC HAD TORN IT OUT OF
THE DEAD MANS HAND AND ALMOST CERTAIN THAT HE MUST HAVE THRUST IT
INTO THE POCKET OF HIS DRESSINGGOWN WHERE ELSE COULD HE HAVE PUT
IT THE ONLY QUESTION WAS WHETHER IT WAS STILL THERE IT WAS WORTH AN
EFFORT TO FIND OUT AND FOR THAT OBJECT WE ALL WENT UP TO THE HOUSE
THE CUNNINGHAMS JOINED US AS YOU DOUBTLESS REMEMBER OUTSIDE THE
KITCHEN DOOR IT WAS OF COURSE OF THE VERY FIRST IMPORTANCE THAT
THEY SHOULD NOT BE REMINDED OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS PAPER OTHERWISE
THEY WOULD NATURALLY DESTROY IT WITHOUT DELAY THE INSPECTOR WAS
ABOUT TO TELL THEM THE IMPORTANCE WHICH WE ATTACHED TO IT WHEN BY
THE LUCKIEST CHANCE IN THE WORLD I TUMBLED DOWN IN A SORT OF FIT AND
SO CHANGED THE CONVERSATION
GOOD HEAVENS CRIED THE COLONEL LAUGHING DO YOU MEAN TO SAY ALL
OUR SYMPATHY WAS WASTED AND YOUR FIT AN IMPOSTURE
SPEAKING PROFESSIONALLY IT WAS ADMIRABLY DONE CRIED I LOOKING IN
AMAZEMENT AT THIS MAN WHO WAS FOREVER CONFOUNDING ME WITH SOME NEW
PHASE OF HIS ASTUTENESS
IT IS AN ART WHICH IS OFTEN USEFUL SAID HE WHEN I RECOVERED I
MANAGED BY A DEVICE WHICH HAD PERHAPS SOME LITTLE MERIT OF
INGENUITY TO GET OLD CUNNINGHAM TO WRITE THE WORD TWELVE SO THAT
I MIGHT COMPARE IT WITH THE TWELVE UPON THE PAPER
OH WHAT AN ASS I HAVE BEEN I EXCLAIMED
I COULD SEE THAT YOU WERE COMMISERATING WITH ME OVER MY WEAKNESS
SAID HOLMES LAUGHING I WAS SORRY TO CAUSE YOU THE SYMPATHETIC PAIN
WHICH I KNOW THAT YOU FELT WE THEN WENT UPSTAIRS TOGETHER AND
HAVING ENTERED THE ROOM AND SEEN THE DRESSINGGOWN HANGING UP BEHIND
THE DOOR I CONTRIVED BY UPSETTING A TABLE TO ENGAGE THEIR
ATTENTION FOR THE MOMENT AND SLIPPED BACK TO EXAMINE THE POCKETS I
HAD HARDLY GOT THE PAPER HOWEVERWHICH WAS AS I HAD EXPECTED IN
ONE OF THEMWHEN THE TWO CUNNINGHAMS WERE ON ME AND WOULD I VERILY
BELIEVE HAVE MURDERED ME THEN AND THERE BUT FOR YOUR PROMPT AND
FRIENDLY AID AS IT IS I FEEL THAT YOUNG MANS GRIP ON MY THROAT
NOW AND THE FATHER HAS TWISTED MY WRIST ROUND IN THE EFFORT TO GET
THE PAPER OUT OF MY HAND THEY SAW THAT I MUST KNOW ALL ABOUT IT YOU
SEE AND THE SUDDEN CHANGE FROM ABSOLUTE SECURITY TO COMPLETE DESPAIR
MADE THEM PERFECTLY DESPERATE
I HAD A LITTLE TALK WITH OLD CUNNINGHAM AFTERWARDS AS TO THE MOTIVE
OF THE CRIME HE WAS TRACTABLE ENOUGH THOUGH HIS SON WAS A PERFECT
DEMON READY TO BLOW OUT HIS OWN OR ANYBODY ELSES BRAINS IF HE COULD
HAVE GOT TO HIS REVOLVER WHEN CUNNINGHAM SAW THAT THE CASE AGAINST
HIM WAS SO STRONG HE LOST ALL HEART AND MADE A CLEAN BREAST OF
EVERYTHING IT SEEMS THAT WILLIAM HAD SECRETLY FOLLOWED HIS TWO
MASTERS ON THE NIGHT WHEN THEY MADE THEIR RAID UPON MR ACTONS AND
HAVING THUS GOT THEM INTO HIS POWER PROCEEDED UNDER THREATS OF
EXPOSURE TO LEVY BLACKMAIL UPON THEM MR ALEC HOWEVER WAS A
DANGEROUS MAN TO PLAY GAMES OF THAT SORT WITH IT WAS A STROKE OF
POSITIVE GENIUS ON HIS PART TO SEE IN THE BURGLARY SCARE WHICH WAS
CONVULSING THE COUNTRY SIDE AN OPPORTUNITY OF PLAUSIBLY GETTING RID
OF THE MAN WHOM HE FEARED WILLIAM WAS DECOYED UP AND SHOT AND HAD
THEY ONLY GOT THE WHOLE OF THE NOTE AND PAID A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION
TO DETAIL IN THE ACCESSORIES IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT SUSPICION
MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN AROUSED
AND THE NOTE I ASKED
SHERLOCK HOLMES PLACED THE SUBJOINED PAPER BEFORE US
PICTURE PAPER WHICH READS IF YOU WILL ONLY COME AROUND AT QUARTER
TO TWELVE TO THE EAST GATE YOU WILL LEARN WHAT WILL VERY MUCH
SURPRISE YOU AND MAY BE OF THE GREATEST SERVICE TO YOU AND ALSO TO
ANNIE MORRISON BUT SAY NOTHING TO ANYONE UPON THE MATTER IT IS VERY
MUCH THE SORT OF THING THAT I EXPECTED SAID HE OF
COURSE WE DO NOT YET KNOW WHAT THE RELATIONS MAY HAVE BEEN BETWEEN
ALEC CUNNINGHAM WILLIAM KIRWAN AND ANNIE MORRISON THE RESULTS
SHOWS THAT THE TRAP WAS SKILLFULLY BAITED I AM SURE THAT YOU CANNOT
FAIL TO BE DELIGHTED WITH THE TRACES OF HEREDITY SHOWN IN THE PS AND
IN THE TAILS OF THE GS THE ABSENCE OF THE IDOTS IN THE OLD MANS
WRITING IS ALSO MOST CHARACTERISTIC WATSON I THINK OUR QUIET REST
IN THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN A DISTINCT SUCCESS AND I SHALL CERTAINLY
RETURN MUCH INVIGORATED TO BAKER STREET TOMORROW THE CROOKED MAN
ONE SUMMER NIGHT A FEW MONTHS AFTER MY MARRIAGE I WAS SEATED BY MY
OWN HEARTH SMOKING A LAST PIPE AND NODDING OVER A NOVEL FOR MY DAYS
WORK HAD BEEN AN EXHAUSTING ONE MY WIFE HAD ALREADY GONE UPSTAIRS
AND THE SOUND OF THE LOCKING OF THE HALL DOOR SOME TIME BEFORE TOLD
ME THAT THE SERVANTS HAD ALSO RETIRED I HAD RISEN FROM MY SEAT AND
WAS KNOCKING OUT THE ASHES OF MY PIPE WHEN I SUDDENLY HEARD THE CLANG
OF THE BELL
I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK IT WAS A QUARTER TO TWELVE THIS COULD NOT
BE A VISITOR AT SO LATE AN HOUR A PATIENT EVIDENTLY AND POSSIBLY
AN ALLNIGHT SITTING WITH A WRY FACE I WENT OUT INTO THE HALL AND
OPENED THE DOOR TO MY ASTONISHMENT IT WAS SHERLOCK HOLMES WHO STOOD
UPON MY STEP
AH WATSON SAID HE I HOPED THAT I MIGHT NOT BE TOO LATE TO CATCH
YOU
MY DEAR FELLOW PRAY COME IN
YOU LOOK SURPRISED AND NO WONDER RELIEVED TOO I FANCY HUM YOU STILL
SMOKE THE ARCADIA MIXTURE OF YOUR BACHELOR DAYS THEN THERES NO
MISTAKING THAT FLUFFY ASH UPON YOUR COAT ITS EASY TO
TELL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO WEAR A UNIFORM WATSON YOULL
NEVER PASS AS A PUREBRED CIVILIAN AS LONG AS YOU KEEP THAT HABIT OF
CARRYING YOUR HANDKERCHIEF IN YOUR SLEEVE COULD YOU PUT ME UP
TONIGHT
WITH PLEASURE
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU HAD BACHELOR QUARTERS FOR ONE AND I SEE THAT
YOU HAVE NO GENTLEMAN VISITOR AT PRESENT YOUR HATSTAND PROCLAIMS
AS MUCH
I SHALL BE DELIGHTED IF YOU WILL STAY
THANK YOU ILL FILL THE VACANT PEG THEN SORRY TO SEE THAT YOUVE
HAD THE BRITISH WORKMAN IN THE HOUSE HES A TOKEN OF EVIL NOT THE
DRAINS I HOPE
NO THE GAS
AH HE HAS LEFT TWO NAILMARKS FROM HIS BOOT UPON YOUR LINOLEUM
JUST WHERE THE LIGHT STRIKES IT NO THANK YOU I HAD SOME SUPPER AT
WATERLOO BUT ILL SMOKE A PIPE WITH YOU WITH PLEASURE
I HANDED HIM MY POUCH AND HE SEATED HIMSELF OPPOSITE TO ME AND
SMOKED FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE I WAS WELL AWARE THAT NOTHING BUT
BUSINESS OF IMPORTANCE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO ME AT SUCH AN HOUR
SO I WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL HE SHOULD COME ROUND TO IT
I SEE THAT YOU ARE PROFESSIONALLY RATHER BUSY JUST NOW SAID HE
GLANCING VERY KEENLY ACROSS AT ME
YES IVE HAD A BUSY DAY I ANSWERED IT MAY SEEM VERY FOOLISH IN
YOUR EYES I ADDED BUT REALLY I DONT KNOW HOW YOU DEDUCED IT
HOLMES CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF
I HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF KNOWING YOUR HABITS MY DEAR WATSON SAID
HE WHEN YOUR ROUND IS A SHORT ONE YOU WALK AND WHEN IT IS A LONG
ONE YOU USE A HANSOM AS I PERCEIVE THAT YOUR BOOTS ALTHOUGH USED
ARE BY NO MEANS DIRTY I CANNOT DOUBT THAT YOU ARE AT PRESENT BUSY
ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE HANSOM
EXCELLENT I CRIED
ELEMENTARY SAID HE IT IS ONE OF THOSE INSTANCES WHERE THE
REASONER CAN PRODUCE AN EFFECT WHICH SEEMS REMARKABLE TO HIS
NEIGHBOR BECAUSE THE LATTER HAS MISSED THE ONE LITTLE POINT WHICH IS
THE BASIS OF THE DEDUCTION THE SAME MAY BE SAID MY DEAR FELLOW
FOR THE EFFECT OF SOME OF THESE LITTLE SKETCHES OF YOURS WHICH IS
ENTIRELY MERETRICIOUS DEPENDING AS IT DOES UPON YOUR RETAINING IN
YOUR OWN HANDS SOME FACTORS IN THE PROBLEM WHICH ARE NEVER IMPARTED
TO THE READER NOW AT PRESENT I AM IN THE POSITION OF THESE SAME
READERS FOR I HOLD IN THIS HAND SEVERAL THREADS OF ONE OF THE
STRANGEST CASES WHICH EVER PERPLEXED A MANS BRAIN AND YET I LACK
THE ONE OR TWO WHICH ARE NEEDFUL TO COMPLETE MY THEORY BUT ILL
HAVE THEM WATSON ILL HAVE THEM HIS EYES KINDLED AND A SLIGHT
FLUSH SPRANG INTO HIS THIN CHEEKS FOR AN INSTANT THE VEIL HAD LIFTED
UPON HIS KEEN INTENSE NATURE BUT FOR AN INSTANT ONLY WHEN I
GLANCED AGAIN HIS FACE HAD RESUMED THAT REDINDIAN COMPOSURE WHICH
HAD MADE SO MANY REGARD HIM AS A MACHINE RATHER THAN A MAN
THE PROBLEM PRESENTS FEATURES OF INTEREST SAID HE I MAY EVEN
SAY EXCEPTIONAL FEATURES OF INTEREST I HAVE ALREADY LOOKED INTO THE
MATTER AND HAVE COME AS I THINK WITHIN SIGHT OF MY SOLUTION IF
YOU COULD ACCOMPANY ME IN THAT LAST STEP YOU MIGHT BE OF CONSIDERABLE
SERVICE TO ME
I SHOULD BE DELIGHTED
COULD YOU GO AS FAR AS ALDERSHOT TOMORROW
I HAVE NO DOUBT JACKSON WOULD TAKE MY PRACTICE
VERY GOOD I WANT TO START BY THE FROM WATERLOO
THAT WOULD GIVE ME TIME
THEN IF YOU ARE NOT TOO SLEEPY I WILL GIVE YOU A SKETCH OF WHAT
HAS HAPPENED AND OF WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE
I WAS SLEEPY BEFORE YOU CAME I AM QUITE WAKEFUL NOW
I WILL COMPRESS THE STORY AS FAR AS MAY BE DONE WITHOUT OMITTING
ANYTHING VITAL TO THE CASE IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT YOU MAY EVEN HAVE
READ SOME ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER IT IS THE SUPPOSED MURDER OF
COLONEL BARCLAY OF THE ROYAL MUNSTERS AT ALDERSHOT WHICH I AM
INVESTIGATING
I HAVE HEARD NOTHING OF IT
IT HAS NOT EXCITED MUCH ATTENTION YET EXCEPT LOCALLY THE FACTS
ARE ONLY TWO DAYS OLD BRIEFLY THEY ARE THESE
THE ROYAL MUNSTERS IS AS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS IRISH
REGIMENTS IN THE BRITISH ARMY IT DID WONDERS BOTH IN THE CRIMEA AND
THE MUTINY AND HAS SINCE THAT TIME DISTINGUISHED ITSELF UPON EVERY
POSSIBLE OCCASION IT WAS COMMANDED UP TO MONDAY NIGHT BY JAMES
BARCLAY A GALLANT VETERAN WHO STARTED AS A FULL PRIVATE WAS RAISED
TO COMMISSIONED RANK FOR HIS BRAVERY AT THE TIME OF THE MUTINY AND
SO LIVED TO COMMAND THE REGIMENT IN WHICH HE HAD ONCE CARRIED A
MUSKET
COLONEL BARCLAY HAD MARRIED AT THE TIME WHEN HE WAS A SERGEANT AND
HIS WIFE WHOSE MAIDEN NAME WAS MISS NANCY DEVOY WAS THE DAUGHTER OF
A FORMER COLORSERGEANT IN THE SAME CORPS THERE WAS THEREFORE AS
CAN BE IMAGINED SOME LITTLE SOCIAL FRICTION WHEN THE YOUNG COUPLE
FOR THEY WERE STILL YOUNG FOUND THEMSELVES IN THEIR NEW
SURROUNDINGS THEY APPEAR HOWEVER TO HAVE QUICKLY ADAPTED
THEMSELVES AND MRS BARCLAY HAS ALWAYS I UNDERSTAND BEEN AS
POPULAR WITH THE LADIES OF THE REGIMENT AS HER HUSBAND WAS WITH HIS
BROTHER OFFICERS I MAY ADD THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF GREAT BEAUTY
AND THAT EVEN NOW WHEN SHE HAS BEEN MARRIED FOR UPWARDS OF THIRTY
YEARS SHE IS STILL OF A STRIKING AND QUEENLY APPEARANCE
COLONEL BARCLAYS FAMILY LIFE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A UNIFORMLY HAPPY
ONE MAJOR MURPHY TO WHOM I OWE MOST OF MY FACTS ASSURES ME THAT
HE HAS NEVER HEARD OF ANY MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE PAIR ON THE
WHOLE HE THINKS THAT BARCLAYS DEVOTION TO HIS WIFE WAS GREATER THAN
HIS WIFES TO BARCLAY HE WAS ACUTELY UNEASY IF HE WERE ABSENT FROM
HER FOR A DAY SHE ON THE OTHER HAND THOUGH DEVOTED AND FAITHFUL
WAS LESS OBTRUSIVELY AFFECTIONATE BUT THEY WERE REGARDED IN THE
REGIMENT AS THE VERY MODEL OF A MIDDLEAGED COUPLE THERE WAS
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THEIR MUTUAL RELATIONS TO PREPARE PEOPLE FOR
THE TRAGEDY WHICH WAS TO FOLLOW
COLONEL BARCLAY HIMSELF SEEMS TO HAVE HAD SOME SINGULAR TRAITS IN
HIS CHARACTER HE WAS A DASHING JOVIAL OLD SOLDER IN HIS USUAL
MOOD BUT THERE WERE OCCASIONS ON WHICH HE SEEMED TO SHOW HIMSELF
CAPABLE OF CONSIDERABLE VIOLENCE AND VINDICTIVENESS THIS SIDE OF
HIS NATURE HOWEVER APPEARS NEVER TO HAVE BEEN TURNED TOWARDS HIS
WIFE ANOTHER FACT WHICH HAD STRUCK MAJOR MURPHY AND THREE OUT OF
FIVE OF THE OTHER OFFICERS WITH WHOM I CONVERSED WAS THE SINGULAR
SORT OF DEPRESSION WHICH CAME UPON HIM AT TIMES AS THE MAJOR
EXPRESSED IT THE SMILE HAD OFTEN BEEN STRUCK FROM HIS MOUTH AS IF
BY SOME INVISIBLE HAND WHEN HE HAS BEEN JOINING THE GAIETIES AND
CHAFF OF THE MESSTABLE FOR DAYS ON END WHEN THE MOOD WAS ON HIM
HE HAS BEEN SUNK IN THE DEEPEST GLOOM THIS AND A CERTAIN TINGE OF
SUPERSTITION WERE THE ONLY UNUSUAL TRAITS IN HIS CHARACTER WHICH HIS
BROTHER OFFICERS HAD OBSERVED THE LATTER PECULIARITY TOOK THE FORM
OF A DISLIKE TO BEING LEFT ALONE ESPECIALLY AFTER DARK THIS
PUERILE FEATURE IN A NATURE WHICH WAS CONSPICUOUSLY MANLY HAD OFTEN
GIVEN RISE TO COMMENT AND CONJECTURE
THE FIRST BATTALION OF THE ROYAL MUNSTERS WHICH IS THE OLD TH
HAS BEEN STATIONED AT ALDERSHOT FOR SOME YEARS THE MARRIED OFFICERS
LIVE OUT OF BARRACKS AND THE COLONEL HAS DURING ALL THIS TIME
OCCUPIED A VILLA CALLED LACHINE ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE NORTH
CAMP THE HOUSE STANDS IN ITS OWN GROUNDS BUT THE WEST SIDE OF IT
IS NOT MORE THAN THIRTY YARDS FROM THE HIGHROAD A COACHMAN AND TWO
MAIDS FORM THE STAFF OF SERVANTS THESE WITH THEIR MASTER AND
MISTRESS WERE THE SOLE OCCUPANTS OF LACHINE FOR THE BARCLAYS HAD NO
CHILDREN NOR WAS IT USUAL FOR THEM TO HAVE RESIDENT VISITORS
NOW FOR THE EVENTS AT LACHINE BETWEEN NINE AND TEN ON THE EVENING OF
LAST MONDAY
MRS BARCLAY WAS IT APPEARS A MEMBER OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH
AND HAD INTERESTED HERSELF VERY MUCH IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE
GUILD OF ST GEORGE WHICH WAS FORMED IN CONNECTION WITH THE WATT
STREET CHAPEL FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPLYING THE POOR WITH CASTOFF
CLOTHING A MEETING OF THE GUILD HAD BEEN HELD THAT EVENING AT
EIGHT AND MRS BARCLAY HAD HURRIED OVER HER DINNER IN ORDER TO BE
PRESENT AT IT WHEN LEAVING THE HOUSE SHE WAS HEARD BY THE COACHMAN
TO MAKE SOME COMMONPLACE REMARK TO HER HUSBAND AND TO ASSURE HIM
THAT SHE WOULD BE BACK BEFORE VERY LONG SHE THEN CALLED FOR MISS
MORRISON A YOUNG LADY WHO LIVES IN THE NEXT VILLA AND THE TWO WENT
OFF TOGETHER TO THEIR MEETING IT LASTED FORTY MINUTES AND AT A
QUARTERPAST NINE MRS BARCLAY RETURNED HOME HAVING LEFT MISS
MORRISON AT HER DOOR AS SHE PASSED
THERE IS A ROOM WHICH IS USED AS A MORNINGROOM AT LACHINE THIS
FACES THE ROAD AND OPENS BY A LARGE GLASS FOLDINGDOOR ON TO THE
LAWN THE LAWN IS THIRTY YARDS ACROSS AND IS ONLY DIVIDED FROM THE
HIGHWAY BY A LOW WALL WITH AN IRON RAIL ABOVE IT IT WAS INTO THIS
ROOM THAT MRS BARCLAY WENT UPON HER RETURN THE BLINDS WERE NOT
DOWN FOR THE ROOM WAS SELDOM USED IN THE EVENING BUT MRS BARCLAY
HERSELF LIT THE LAMP AND THEN RANG THE BELL ASKING JANE STEWART THE
HOUSEMAID TO BRING HER A CUP OF TEA WHICH WAS QUITE CONTRARY TO
HER USUAL HABITS THE COLONEL HAD BEEN SITTING IN THE DININGROOM
BUT HEARING THAT HIS WIFE HAD RETURNED HE JOINED HER IN THE
MORNINGROOM THE COACHMAN SAW HIM CROSS THE HALL AND ENTER IT HE
WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN ALIVE
THE TEA WHICH HAD BEEN ORDERED WAS BROUGHT UP AT THE END OF TEN
MINUTES BUT THE MAID AS SHE APPROACHED THE DOOR WAS SURPRISED TO
HEAR THE VOICES OF HER MASTER AND MISTRESS IN FURIOUS ALTERCATION SHE
KNOCKED WITHOUT RECEIVING ANY ANSWER AND EVEN TURNED THE HANDLE
BUT ONLY TO FIND THAT THE DOOR WAS LOCKED UPON THE INSIDE NATURALLY
ENOUGH SHE RAN DOWN TO TELL THE COOK AND THE TWO WOMEN WITH THE
COACHMAN CAME UP INTO THE HALL AND LISTENED TO THE DISPUTE WHICH WAS
STILL RAGING THEY ALL AGREED THAT ONLY TWO VOICES WERE TO BE HEARD
THOSE OF BARCLAY AND OF HIS WIFE BARCLAYS REMARKS WERE SUBDUED AND
ABRUPT SO THAT NONE OF THEM WERE AUDIBLE TO THE LISTENERS THE
LADYS ON THE OTHER HAND WERE MOST BITTER AND WHEN SHE RAISED HER
VOICE COULD BE PLAINLY HEARD YOU COWARD SHE REPEATED OVER AND
OVER AGAIN WHAT CAN BE DONE NOW WHAT CAN BE DONE NOW GIVE ME
BACK MY LIFE I WILL NEVER SO MUCH AS BREATHE THE SAME AIR WITH YOU
AGAIN YOU COWARD YOU COWARD THOSE WERE SCRAPS OF HER
CONVERSATION ENDING IN A SUDDEN DREADFUL CRY IN THE MANS VOICE
WITH A CRASH AND A PIERCING SCREAM FROM THE WOMAN CONVINCED THAT
SOME TRAGEDY HAD OCCURRED THE COACHMAN RUSHED TO THE DOOR AND STROVE
TO FORCE IT WHILE SCREAM AFTER SCREAM ISSUED FROM WITHIN HE WAS
UNABLE HOWEVER TO MAKE HIS WAY IN AND THE MAIDS WERE TOO
DISTRACTED WITH FEAR TO BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE TO HIM A SUDDEN
THOUGHT STRUCK HIM HOWEVER AND HE RAN THROUGH THE HALL DOOR AND
ROUND TO THE LAWN UPON WHICH THE LONG FRENCH WINDOWS OPEN ONE SIDE
OF THE WINDOW WAS OPEN WHICH I UNDERSTAND WAS QUITE USUAL IN THE
SUMMERTIME AND HE PASSED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY INTO THE ROOM HIS
MISTRESS HAD CEASED TO SCREAM AND WAS STRETCHED INSENSIBLE UPON A
COUCH WHILE WITH HIS FEET TILTED OVER THE SIDE OF AN ARMCHAIR AND
HIS HEAD UPON THE GROUND NEAR THE CORNER OF THE FENDER WAS LYING THE
UNFORTUNATE SOLDIER STONE DEAD IN A POOL OF HIS OWN BLOOD
NATURALLY THE COACHMANS FIRST THOUGHT ON FINDING THAT HE COULD DO
NOTHING FOR HIS MASTER WAS TO OPEN THE DOOR BUT HERE AN UNEXPECTED
AND SINGULAR DIFFICULTY PRESENTED ITSELF THE KEY WAS NOT IN THE
INNER SIDE OF THE DOOR NOR COULD HE FIND IT ANYWHERE IN THE ROOM HE
WENT OUT AGAIN THEREFORE THROUGH THE WINDOW AND HAVING OBTAINED
THE HELP OF A POLICEMAN AND OF A MEDICAL MAN HE RETURNED THE LADY
AGAINST WHOM NATURALLY THE STRONGEST SUSPICION RESTED WAS REMOVED TO
HER ROOM STILL IN A STATE OF INSENSIBILITY THE COLONELS BODY WAS
THEN PLACED UPON THE SOFA AND A CAREFUL EXAMINATION MADE OF THE
SCENE OF THE TRAGEDY
THE INJURY FROM WHICH THE UNFORTUNATE VETERAN WAS SUFFERING WAS
FOUND TO BE A JAGGED CUT SOME TWO INCHES LONG AT THE BACK PART OF HIS
HEAD WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN CAUSED BY A VIOLENT BLOW FROM A BLUNT
WEAPON NOR WAS IT DIFFICULT TO GUESS WHAT THAT WEAPON MAY HAVE
BEEN UPON THE FLOOR CLOSE TO THE BODY WAS LYING A SINGULAR CLUB
OF HARD CARVED WOOD WITH A BONE HANDLE THE COLONEL POSSESSED A
VARIED COLLECTION OF WEAPONS BROUGHT FROM THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN
WHICH HE HAD FOUGHT AND IT IS CONJECTURED BY THE POLICE THAT HIS
CLUB WAS AMONG HIS TROPHIES THE SERVANTS DENY HAVING SEEN IT
BEFORE BUT AMONG THE NUMEROUS CURIOSITIES IN THE HOUSE IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED NOTHING ELSE OF
IMPORTANCE WAS DISCOVERED IN THE ROOM BY THE POLICE SAVE THE
INEXPLICABLE FACT THAT NEITHER UPON MRS BARCLAYS PERSON NOR UPON
THAT OF THE VICTIM NOR IN ANY PART OF THE ROOM WAS THE MISSING KEY TO
BE FOUND THE DOOR HAD EVENTUALLY TO BE OPENED BY A LOCKSMITH FROM
ALDERSHOT
THAT WAS THE STATE OF THINGS WATSON WHEN UPON THE TUESDAY MORNING
I AT THE REQUEST OF MAJOR MURPHY WENT DOWN TO ALDERSHOT TO
SUPPLEMENT THE EFFORTS OF THE POLICE I THINK THAT YOU WILL
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PROBLEM WAS ALREADY ONE OF INTEREST BUT MY
OBSERVATIONS SOON MADE ME REALIZE THAT IT WAS IN TRUTH MUCH MORE
EXTRAORDINARY THAN WOULD AT FIRST SIGHT APPEAR
BEFORE EXAMINING THE ROOM I CROSSQUESTIONED THE SERVANTS BUT ONLY
SUCCEEDED IN ELICITING THE FACTS WHICH I HAVE ALREADY STATED ONE
OTHER DETAIL OF INTEREST WAS REMEMBERED BY JANE STEWART THE
HOUSEMAID YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT ON HEARING THE SOUND OF THE
QUARREL SHE DESCENDED AND RETURNED WITH THE OTHER SERVANTS ON THAT
FIRST OCCASION WHEN SHE WAS ALONE SHE SAYS THAT THE VOICES OF HER
MASTER AND MISTRESS WERE SUNK SO LOW THAT SHE COULD HEAR HARDLY
ANYTHING AND JUDGED BY THEIR TONES RATHER THAN THEIR WORDS THAT THEY
HAD FALLEN OUT ON MY PRESSING HER HOWEVER SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE
HEARD THE WORD DAVID UTTERED TWICE BY THE LADY THE POINT IS OF THE
UTMOST IMPORTANCE AS GUIDING US TOWARDS THE REASON OF THE SUDDEN
QUARREL THE COLONELS NAME YOU REMEMBER WAS JAMES
THERE WAS ONE THING IN THE CASE WHICH HAD MADE THE DEEPEST
IMPRESSION BOTH UPON THE SERVANTS AND THE POLICE THIS WAS THE
CONTORTION OF THE COLONELS FACE IT HAD SET ACCORDING TO THEIR
ACCOUNT INTO THE MOST DREADFUL EXPRESSION OF FEAR AND HORROR WHICH A
HUMAN COUNTENANCE IS CAPABLE OF ASSUMING MORE THAN ONE PERSON
FAINTED AT THE MERE SIGHT OF HIM SO TERRIBLE WAS THE EFFECT IT WAS
QUITE CERTAIN THAT HE HAD FORESEEN HIS FATE AND THAT IT HAD CAUSED
HIM THE UTMOST HORROR THIS OF COURSE FITTED IN WELL ENOUGH WITH
THE POLICE THEORY IF THE COLONEL COULD HAVE SEEN HIS WIFE MAKING A
MURDEROUS ATTACK UPON HIM NOR WAS THE FACT OF THE WOUND BEING ON
THE BACK OF HIS HEAD A FATAL OBJECTION TO THIS AS HE MIGHT HAVE
TURNED TO AVOID THE BLOW NO INFORMATION COULD BE GOT FROM THE LADY
HERSELF WHO WAS TEMPORARILY INSANE FROM AN ACUTE ATTACK OF
BRAINFEVER
FROM THE POLICE I LEARNED THAT MISS MORRISON WHO YOU REMEMBER WENT
OUT THAT EVENING WITH MRS BARCLAY DENIED HAVING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF
WHAT IT WAS WHICH HAD CAUSED THE ILLHUMOR IN WHICH HER COMPANION HAD
RETURNED
HAVING GATHERED THESE FACTS WATSON I SMOKED SEVERAL PIPES OVER
THEM TRYING TO SEPARATE THOSE WHICH WERE CRUCIAL FROM OTHERS WHICH
WERE MERELY INCIDENTAL THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION THAT THE MOST
DISTINCTIVE AND SUGGESTIVE POINT IN THE CASE WAS THE SINGULAR
DISAPPEARANCE OF THE DOORKEY A MOST CAREFUL SEARCH HAD FAILED TO
DISCOVER IT IN THE ROOM THEREFORE IT MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM IT BUT
NEITHER THE COLONEL NOR THE COLONELS WIFE COULD HAVE TAKEN IT THAT WAS
PERFECTLY CLEAR THEREFORE A THIRD PERSON MUST HAVE ENTERED
THE ROOM AND THAT THIRD PERSON COULD ONLY HAVE COME IN THROUGH THE
WINDOW IT SEEMED TO ME THAT A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM AND
THE LAWN MIGHT POSSIBLY REVEAL SOME TRACES OF THIS MYSTERIOUS
INDIVIDUAL YOU KNOW MY METHODS WATSON THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM
WHICH I DID NOT APPLY TO THE INQUIRY AND IT ENDED BY MY DISCOVERING
TRACES BUT VERY DIFFERENT ONES FROM THOSE WHICH I HAD EXPECTED THERE
HAD BEEN A MAN IN THE ROOM AND HE HAD CROSSED THE LAWN COMING
FROM THE ROAD I WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN FIVE VERY CLEAR IMPRESSIONS OF
HIS FOOTMARKS ONE IN THE ROADWAY ITSELF AT THE POINT WHERE HE HAD
CLIMBED THE LOW WALL TWO ON THE LAWN AND TWO VERY FAINT ONES UPON
THE STAINED BOARDS NEAR THE WINDOW WHERE HE HAD ENTERED HE HAD
APPARENTLY RUSHED ACROSS THE LAWN FOR HIS TOEMARKS WERE MUCH DEEPER
THAN HIS HEELS BUT IT WAS NOT THE MAN WHO SURPRISED ME IT WAS HIS
COMPANION
HIS COMPANION
HOLMES PULLED A LARGE SHEET OF TISSUEPAPER OUT OF HIS POCKET AND
CAREFULLY UNFOLDED IT UPON HIS KNEE
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT HE ASKED
THE PAPER WAS COVERED WITH THE TRACINGS OF THE FOOTMARKS OF SOME
SMALL ANIMAL IT HAD FIVE WELLMARKED FOOTPADS AN INDICATION OF
LONG NAILS AND THE WHOLE PRINT MIGHT BE NEARLY AS LARGE AS A
DESSERTSPOON
ITS A DOG SAID I
DID YOU EVER HEAR OF A DOG RUNNING UP A CURTAIN I FOUND DISTINCT
TRACES THAT THIS CREATURE HAD DONE SO
A MONKEY THEN
BUT IT IS NOT THE PRINT OF A MONKEY
WHAT CAN IT BE THEN
NEITHER DOG NOR CAT NOR MONKEY NOR ANY CREATURE THAT WE ARE FAMILIAR
WITH I HAVE TRIED TO RECONSTRUCT IT FROM THE MEASUREMENTS HERE
ARE FOUR PRINTS WHERE THE BEAST HAS BEEN STANDING MOTIONLESS YOU
SEE THAT IT IS NO LESS THAN FIFTEEN INCHES FROM FOREFOOT TO HIND ADD
TO THAT THE LENGTH OF NECK AND HEAD AND YOU GET A CREATURE NOT
MUCH LESS THAN TWO FEET LONGPROBABLY MORE IF THERE IS ANY TAIL BUT NOW
OBSERVE THIS OTHER MEASUREMENT THE ANIMAL HAS BEEN MOVING
AND WE HAVE THE LENGTH OF ITS STRIDE IN EACH CASE IT IS ONLY ABOUT
THREE INCHES YOU HAVE AN INDICATION YOU SEE OF A LONG BODY WITH
VERY SHORT LEGS ATTACHED TO IT IT HAS NOT BEEN CONSIDERATE ENOUGH
TO LEAVE ANY OF ITS HAIR BEHIND IT BUT ITS GENERAL SHAPE MUST BE
WHAT I HAVE INDICATED AND IT CAN RUN UP A CURTAIN AND IT IS
CARNIVOROUS
HOW DO YOU DEDUCE THAT
BECAUSE IT RAN UP THE CURTAIN A CANARYS CAGE WAS HANGING IN THE
WINDOW AND ITS AIM SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN TO GET AT THE BIRD
THEN WHAT WAS THE BEAST
AH IF I COULD GIVE IT A NAME IT MIGHT GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS SOLVING
THE CASE ON THE WHOLE IT WAS PROBABLY SOME CREATURE OF THE WEASEL
AND STOAT TRIBEAND YET IT IS LARGER THAN ANY OF THESE THAT I HAVE
SEEN
BUT WHAT HAD IT TO DO WITH THE CRIME
THAT ALSO IS STILL OBSCURE BUT WE HAVE LEARNED A GOOD DEAL YOU
PERCEIVE WE KNOW THAT A MAN STOOD IN THE ROAD LOOKING AT THE
QUARREL BETWEEN THE BARCLAYSTHE BLINDS WERE UP AND THE ROOM
LIGHTED WE KNOW ALSO THAT HE RAN ACROSS THE LAWN ENTERED THE
ROOM ACCOMPANIED BY A STRANGE ANIMAL AND THAT HE EITHER STRUCK THE
COLONEL OR AS IS EQUALLY POSSIBLE THAT THE COLONEL FELL DOWN FROM
SHEER FRIGHT AT THE SIGHT OF HIM AND CUT HIS HEAD ON THE CORNER OF
THE FENDER FINALLY WE HAVE THE CURIOUS FACT THAT THE INTRUDER
CARRIED AWAY THE KEY WITH HIM WHEN HE LEFT
YOUR DISCOVERIES SEEM TO HAVE LEFT THE BUSINESS MORE OBSCURE THAT IT
WAS BEFORE SAID I
QUITE SO THEY UNDOUBTEDLY SHOWED THAT THE AFFAIR WAS MUCH DEEPER
THAN WAS AT FIRST CONJECTURED I THOUGHT THE MATTER OVER AND I CAME
TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I MUST APPROACH THE CASE FROM ANOTHER ASPECT
BUT REALLY WATSON I AM KEEPING YOU UP AND I MIGHT JUST AS WELL
TELL YOU ALL THIS ON OUR WAY TO ALDERSHOT TOMORROW
THANK YOU YOU HAVE GONE RATHER TOO FAR TO STOP
IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT WHEN MRS BARCLAY LEFT THE HOUSE AT
HALFPAST SEVEN SHE WAS ON GOOD TERMS WITH HER HUSBAND SHE WAS
NEVER AS I THINK I HAVE SAID OSTENTATIOUSLY AFFECTIONATE BUT SHE
WAS HEARD BY THE COACHMAN CHATTING WITH THE COLONEL IN A FRIENDLY
FASHION NOW IT WAS EQUALLY CERTAIN THAT IMMEDIATELY ON HER
RETURN SHE HAD GONE TO THE ROOM IN WHICH SHE WAS LEAST LIKELY TO SEE
HER HUSBAND HAD FLOWN TO TEA AS AN AGITATED WOMAN WILL AND FINALLY
ON HIS COMING IN TO HER HAD BROKEN INTO VIOLENT RECRIMINATIONS
THEREFORE SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED BETWEEN SEVENTHIRTY AND NINE
OCLOCK WHICH HAD COMPLETELY ALTERED HER FEELINGS TOWARDS HIM BUT
MISS MORRISON HAD BEEN WITH HER DURING THE WHOLE OF THAT HOUR AND A
HALF IT WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THEREFORE IN SPITE OF HER DENIAL
THAT SHE MUST KNOW SOMETHING OF THE MATTER
MY FIRST CONJECTURE WAS THAT POSSIBLY THERE HAD BEEN SOME PASSAGES
BETWEEN THIS YOUNG LADY AND THE OLD SOLDIER WHICH THE FORMER HAD NOW
CONFESSED TO THE WIFE THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE ANGRY RETURN AND
ALSO FOR THE GIRLS DENIAL THAT ANYTHING HAD OCCURRED NOR WOULD IT
BE ENTIRELY INCOMPATIBLE WITH MOST OF THE WORDS OVERHEAD BUT THERE
WAS THE REFERENCE TO DAVID AND THERE WAS THE KNOWN AFFECTION OF THE
COLONEL FOR HIS WIFE TO WEIGH AGAINST IT TO SAY NOTHING OF THE
TRAGIC INTRUSION OF THIS OTHER MAN WHICH MIGHT OF COURSE BE
ENTIRELY DISCONNECTED WITH WHAT HAD GONE BEFORE IT WAS NOT EASY TO
PICK ONES STEPS BUT ON THE WHOLE I WAS INCLINED TO DISMISS THE
IDEA THAT THERE HAD BEEN ANYTHING BETWEEN THE COLONEL AND MISS
MORRISON BUT MORE THAN EVER CONVINCED THAT THE YOUNG LADY HELD THE
CLUE AS TO WHAT IT WAS WHICH HAD TURNED MRS BARCLAY TO HATRED OF HER
HUSBAND I TOOK THE OBVIOUS COURSE THEREFORE OF CALLING UPON MISS
M OF EXPLAINING TO HER THAT I WAS PERFECTLY CERTAIN THAT SHE HELD
THE FACTS IN HER POSSESSION AND OF ASSURING HER THAT HER FRIEND
MRS BARCLAY MIGHT FIND HERSELF IN THE DOCK UPON A CAPITAL CHARGE
UNLESS THE MATTER WERE CLEARED UP
MISS MORRISON IS A LITTLE ETHEREAL SLIP OF A GIRL WITH TIMID EYES
AND BLOND HAIR BUT I FOUND HER BY NO MEANS WANTING IN SHREWDNESS AND
COMMONSENSE SHE SAT THINKING FOR SOME TIME AFTER I HAD SPOKEN AND
THEN TURNING TO ME WITH A BRISK AIR OF RESOLUTION SHE BROKE INTO A
REMARKABLE STATEMENT WHICH I WILL CONDENSE FOR YOUR BENEFIT
I PROMISED MY FRIEND THAT I WOULD SAY NOTHING OF THE MATTER AND A
PROMISE IS A PROMISE SAID SHE BUT IF I CAN REALLY HELP HER WHEN
SO SERIOUS A CHARGE IS LAID AGAINST HER AND WHEN HER OWN MOUTH POOR
DARLING IS CLOSED BY ILLNESS THEN I THINK I AM ABSOLVED FROM MY
PROMISE I WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED UPON MONDAY EVENING
WE WERE RETURNING FROM THE WATT STREET MISSION ABOUT A QUARTER TO
NINE OCLOCK ON OUR WAY WE HAD TO PASS THROUGH HUDSON STREET WHICH
IS A VERY QUIET THOROUGHFARE THERE IS ONLY ONE LAMP IN IT UPON THE
LEFTHAND SIDE AND AS WE APPROACHED THIS LAMP I SAW A MAN COMING
TOWARDS US WITH IS BACK VERY BENT AND SOMETHING LIKE A BOX SLUNG
OVER ONE OF HIS SHOULDERS HE APPEARED TO BE DEFORMED FOR HE
CARRIED HIS HEAD LOW AND WALKED WITH HIS KNEES BENT WE WERE PASSING
HIM WHEN HE RAISED HIS FACE TO LOOK AT US IN THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT
THROWN BY THE LAMP AND AS HE DID SO HE STOPPED AND SCREAMED OUT IN A
DREADFUL VOICE MY GOD ITS NANCY MRS BARCLAY TURNED AS WHITE
AS DEATH AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN DOWN HAD THE DREADFULLOOKING
CREATURE NOT CAUGHT HOLD OF HER I WAS GOING TO CALL FOR THE POLICE
BUT SHE TO MY SURPRISE SPOKE QUITE CIVILLY TO THE FELLOW
I THOUGHT YOU HAD BEEN DEAD THIS THIRTY YEARS HENRY SAID SHE
IN A SHAKING VOICE
SO I HAVE SAID HE AND IT WAS AWFUL TO HEAR THE TONES THAT HE
SAID IT IN HE HAD A VERY DARK FEARSOME FACE AND A GLEAM IN HIS
EYES THAT COMES BACK TO ME IN MY DREAMS HIS HAIR AND WHISKERS WERE
SHOT WITH GRAY AND HIS FACE WAS ALL CRINKLED AND PUCKERED LIKE A
WITHERED APPLE
JUST WALK ON A LITTLE WAY DEAR SAID MRS BARCLAY I WANT TO
HAVE A WORD WITH THIS MAN THERE IS NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF SHE
TRIED TO SPEAK BOLDLY BUT SHE WAS STILL DEADLY PALE AND COULD HARDLY
GET HER WORDS OUT FOR THE TREMBLING OF HER LIPS
I DID AS SHE ASKED ME AND THEY TALKED TOGETHER FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN
SHE CAME DOWN THE STREET WITH HER EYES BLAZING AND I SAW THE
CRIPPLED WRETCH STANDING BY THE LAMPPOST AND SHAKING HIS CLENCHED
FISTS IN THE AIR AS IF HE WERE MAD WITH RAGE SHE NEVER SAID A WORD
UNTIL WE WERE AT THE DOOR HERE WHEN SHE TOOK ME BY THE HAND AND
BEGGED ME TO TELL NO ONE WHAT HAD HAPPENED
ITS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF MINE WHO HAS COME DOWN IN THE WORLD
SAID SHE WHEN I PROMISED HER I WOULD SAY NOTHING SHE KISSED ME AND
I HAVE NEVER SEEN HER SINCE I HAVE TOLD YOU NOW THE WHOLE TRUTH
AND IF I WITHHELD IT FROM THE POLICE IT IS BECAUSE I DID NOT REALIZE
THEN THE DANGER IN WHICH MY DEAR FRIEND STOOD I KNOW THAT IT CAN
ONLY BE TO HER ADVANTAGE THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE KNOWN
THERE WAS HER STATEMENT WATSON AND TO ME AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT
WAS LIKE A LIGHT ON A DARK NIGHT EVERYTHING WHICH HAD BEEN
DISCONNECTED BEFORE BEGAN AT ONCE TO ASSUME ITS TRUE PLACE AND I HAD
A SHADOWY PRESENTIMENT OF THE WHOLE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS MY NEXT STEP
OBVIOUSLY WAS TO FIND THE MAN WHO HAD PRODUCED SUCH A REMARKABLE
IMPRESSION UPON MRS BARCLAY IF HE WERE STILL IN ALDERSHOT IT
SHOULD NOT BE A VERY DIFFICULT MATTER THERE ARE NOT SUCH A VERY
GREAT NUMBER OF CIVILIANS AND A DEFORMED MAN WAS SURE TO HAVE
ATTRACTED ATTENTION I SPENT A DAY IN THE SEARCH AND BY
EVENINGTHIS VERY EVENING WATSONI HAD RUN HIM DOWN THE MANS
NAME IS HENRY WOOD AND HE LIVES IN LODGINGS IN THIS SAME STREET IN
WHICH THE LADIES MET HIM HE HAS ONLY BEEN FIVE DAYS IN THE PLACE IN
THE CHARACTER OF A REGISTRATIONAGENT I HAD A MOST INTERESTING
GOSSIP WITH HIS LANDLADY THE MAN IS BY TRADE A CONJURER AND
PERFORMER GOING ROUND THE CANTEENS AFTER NIGHTFALL AND GIVING A
LITTLE ENTERTAINMENT AT EACH HE CARRIES SOME CREATURE ABOUT WITH
HIM IN THAT BOX ABOUT WHICH THE LANDLADY SEEMED TO BE IN
CONSIDERABLE TREPIDATION FOR SHE HAD NEVER SEEN AN ANIMAL LIKE IT HE
USES IT IN SOME OF HIS TRICKS ACCORDING TO HER ACCOUNT SO MUCH
THE WOMAN WAS ABLE TO TELL ME AND ALSO THAT IT WAS A WONDER THE MAN
LIVED SEEING HOW TWISTED HE WAS AND THAT HE SPOKE IN A STRANGE
TONGUE SOMETIMES AND THAT FOR THE LAST TWO NIGHTS SHE HAD HEARD HIM
GROANING AND WEEPING IN HIS BEDROOM HE WAS ALL RIGHT AS FAR AS
MONEY WENT BUT IN HIS DEPOSIT HE HAD GIVEN HER WHAT LOOKED LIKE A
BAD FLORIN SHE SHOWED IT TO ME WATSON AND IT WAS AN INDIAN RUPEE
SO NOW MY DEAR FELLOW YOU SEE EXACTLY HOW WE STAND AND WHY IT IS I
WANT YOU IT IS PERFECTLY PLAIN THAT AFTER THE LADIES PARTED FROM
THIS MAN HE FOLLOWED THEM AT A DISTANCE THAT HE SAW THE QUARREL
BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE THROUGH THE WINDOW THAT HE RUSHED IN AND
THAT THE CREATURE WHICH HE CARRIED IN HIS BOX GOT LOOSE THAT IS ALL
VERY CERTAIN BUT HE IS THE ONLY PERSON IN THIS WORLD WHO CAN TELL
US EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT ROOM
AND YOU INTEND TO ASK HIM
MOST CERTAINLYBUT IN THE PRESENCE OF A WITNESS
AND I AM THE WITNESS
IF YOU WILL BE SO GOOD IF HE CAN CLEAR THE MATTER UP WELL AND
GOOD IF HE REFUSES WE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO APPLY FOR A
WARRANT
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW HELL BE THERE WHEN WE RETURN
YOU MAY BE SURE THAT I TOOK SOME PRECAUTIONS I HAVE ONE OF MY
BAKER STREET BOYS MOUNTING GUARD OVER HIM WHO WOULD STICK TO HIM LIKE
A BURR GO WHERE HE MIGHT WE SHALL FIND HIM IN HUDSON STREET
TOMORROW WATSON AND MEANWHILE I SHOULD BE THE CRIMINAL MYSELF IF I
KEPT YOU OUT OF BED ANY LONGER
IT WAS MIDDAY WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES AT THE SCENE OF THE TRAGEDY
AND UNDER MY COMPANIONS GUIDANCE WE MADE OUR WAY AT ONCE TO HUDSON
STREET IN SPITE OF HIS CAPACITY FOR CONCEALING HIS EMOTIONS I
COULD EASILY SEE THAT HOLMES WAS IN A STATE OF SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT
WHILE I WAS MYSELF TINGLING WITH THAT HALFSPORTING
HALFINTELLECTUAL PLEASURE WHICH I INVARIABLY EXPERIENCED WHEN I
ASSOCIATED MYSELF WITH HIM IN HIS INVESTIGATIONS
THIS IS THE STREET SAID HE AS WE TURNED INTO A SHORT THOROUGHFARE
LINED WITH PLAIN TWOSTORIED BRICK HOUSES AH HERE IS SIMPSON TO
REPORT
HES IN ALL RIGHT MR HOLMES CRIED A SMALL STREET ARAB RUNNING
UP TO US
GOOD SIMPSON SAID HOLMES PATTING HIM ON THE HEAD COME ALONG
WATSON THIS IS THE HOUSE HE SENT IN HIS CARD WITH A MESSAGE THAT
HE HAD COME ON IMPORTANT BUSINESS AND A MOMENT LATER WE WERE FACE TO
FACE WITH THE MAN WHOM WE HAD COME TO SEE IN SPITE OF THE WARM
WEATHER HE WAS CROUCHING OVER A FIRE AND THE LITTLE ROOM WAS LIKE AN
OVEN THE MAN SAT ALL TWISTED AND HUDDLED IN HIS CHAIR IN A WAY
WHICH GAVE AN INDESCRIBABLY IMPRESSION OF DEFORMITY BUT THE FACE
WHICH HE TURNED TOWARDS US THOUGH WORN AND SWARTHY MUST AT SOME
TIME HAVE BEEN REMARKABLE FOR ITS BEAUTY HE LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY AT
US NOW OUT OF YELLOWSHOT BILIOUS EYES AND WITHOUT SPEAKING OR
RISING HE WAVED TOWARDS TWO CHAIRS
MR HENRY WOOD LATE OF INDIA I BELIEVE SAID HOLMES AFFABLY IVE COME
OVER THIS LITTLE MATTER OF COLONEL BARCLAYS DEATH
WHAT SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT THAT
THATS WHAT I WANT TO ASCERTAIN YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE THAT UNLESS
THE MATTER IS CLEARED UP MRS BARCLAY WHO IS AN OLD FRIEND OF
YOURS WILL IN ALL PROBABILITY BE TRIED FOR MURDER
THE MAN GAVE A VIOLENT START
I DONT KNOW WHO YOU ARE HE CRIED NOR HOW YOU COME TO KNOW WHAT
YOU DO KNOW BUT WILL YOU SWEAR THAT THIS IS TRUE THAT YOU TELL ME
WHY THEY ARE ONLY WAITING FOR HER TO COME TO HER SENSES TO ARREST
HER
MY GOD ARE YOU IN THE POLICE YOURSELF
NO
WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF YOURS THEN
ITS EVERY MANS BUSINESS TO SEE JUSTICE DONE
YOU CAN TAKE MY WORD THAT SHE IS INNOCENT
THEN YOU ARE GUILTY
NO I AM NOT
WHO KILLED COLONEL JAMES BARCLAY THEN
IT WAS A JUST PROVIDENCE THAT KILLED HIM BUT MIND YOU THIS THAT
IF I HAD KNOCKED HIS BRAINS OUT AS IT WAS IN MY HEART TO DO HE
WOULD HAVE HAD NO MORE THAN HIS DUE FROM MY HANDS IF HIS OWN GUILTY
CONSCIENCE HAD NOT STRUCK HIM DOWN IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH THAT I MIGHT
HAVE HAD HIS BLOOD UPON MY SOUL YOU WANT ME TO TELL THE STORY WELL I
DONT KNOW WHY I SHOULDNT FOR THERES NO CAUSE FOR ME TO BE
ASHAMED OF IT
IT WAS IN THIS WAY SIR YOU SEE ME NOW WITH MY BACK LIKE A CAMEL
AND BY RIBS ALL AWRY BUT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN CORPORAL HENRY WOOD
WAS THE SMARTEST MAN IN THE TH FOOT WE WERE IN INDIA THEN IN
CANTONMENTS AT A PLACE WELL CALL BHURTEE BARCLAY WHO DIED THE
OTHER DAY WAS SERGEANT IN THE SAME COMPANY AS MYSELF AND THE BELLE
OF THE REGIMENT AY AND THE FINEST GIRL THAT EVER HAD THE BREATH OF
LIFE BETWEEN HER LIPS WAS NANCY DEVOY THE DAUGHTER OF THE
COLORSERGEANT THERE WERE TWO MEN THAT LOVED HER AND ONE THAT SHE
LOVED AND YOULL SMILE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS POOR THING HUDDLED
BEFORE THE FIRE AND HEAR ME SAY THAT IT WAS FOR MY GOOD LOOKS THAT
SHE LOVED ME
WELL THOUGH I HAD HER HEART HER FATHER WAS SET UPON HER MARRYING
BARCLAY I WAS A HARUMSCARUM RECKLESS LAD AND HE HAD HAD AN
EDUCATION AND WAS ALREADY MARKED FOR THE SWORDBELT BUT THE GIRL
HELD TRUE TO ME AND IT SEEMED THAT I WOULD HAVE HAD HER WHEN THE
MUTINY BROKE OUT AND ALL HELL WAS LOOSE IN THE COUNTRY
WE WERE SHUT UP IN BHURTEE THE REGIMENT OF US WITH HALF A BATTERY
OF ARTILLERY A COMPANY OF SIKHS AND A LOT OF CIVILIANS AND
WOMENFOLK THERE WERE TEN THOUSAND REBELS ROUND US AND THEY WERE
AS KEEN AS A SET OF TERRIERS ROUND A RATCAGE ABOUT THE SECOND WEEK
OF IT OUR WATER GAVE OUT AND IT WAS A QUESTION WHETHER WE COULD
COMMUNICATE WITH GENERAL NEILLS COLUMN WHICH WAS MOVING UP COUNTRY
IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE FOR WE COULD NOT HOPE TO FIGHT OUR WAY OUT
WITH ALL THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN SO I VOLUNTEERED TO GO OUT AND TO
WARN GENERAL NEILL OF OUR DANGER MY OFFER WAS ACCEPTED AND I
TALKED IT OVER WITH SERGEANT BARCLAY WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO KNOW THE
GROUND BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MAN AND WHO DREW UP A ROUTE BY WHICH I
MIGHT GET THROUGH THE REBEL LINES AT TEN OCLOCK THE SAME NIGHT I
STARTED OFF UPON MY JOURNEY THERE WERE A THOUSAND LIVES TO SAVE
BUT IT WAS OF ONLY ONE THAT I WAS THINKING WHEN I DROPPED OVER THE
WALL THAT NIGHT
MY WAY RAN DOWN A DRIEDUP WATERCOURSE WHICH WE HOPED WOULD SCREEN
ME FROM THE ENEMYS SENTRIES BUT AS I CREPT ROUND THE CORNER OF IT I
WALKED RIGHT INTO SIX OF THEM WHO WERE CROUCHING DOWN IN THE DARK
WAITING FOR ME IN AN INSTANT I WAS STUNNED WITH A BLOW AND BOUND
HAND AND FOOT BUT THE REAL BLOW WAS TO MY HEART AND NOT TO MY HEAD
FOR AS I CAME TO AND LISTENED TO AS MUCH AS I COULD UNDERSTAND OF
THEIR TALK I HEARD ENOUGH TO TELL ME THAT MY COMRADE THE VERY MAN
WHO HAD ARRANGED THE WAY THAT I WAS TO TAKE HAD BETRAYED ME BY MEANS
OF A NATIVE SERVANT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY
WELL THERES NO NEED FOR ME TO DWELL ON THAT PART OF IT YOU KNOW
NOW WHAT JAMES BARCLAY WAS CAPABLE OF BHURTEE WAS RELIEVED BY NEILL
NEXT DAY BUT THE REBELS TOOK ME AWAY WITH THEM IN THEIR RETREAT AND
IT WAS MANY A LONG YEAR BEFORE EVER I SAW A WHITE FACE AGAIN I WAS
TORTURED AND TRIED TO GET AWAY AND WAS CAPTURED AND TORTURED AGAIN YOU
CAN SEE FOR YOURSELVES THE STATE IN WHICH I WAS LEFT SOME OF
THEM THAT FLED INTO NEPAL TOOK ME WITH THEM AND THEN AFTERWARDS I
WAS UP PAST DARJEELING THE HILLFOLK UP THERE MURDERED THE REBELS
WHO HAD ME AND I BECAME THEIR SLAVE FOR A TIME UNTIL I ESCAPED BUT
INSTEAD OF GOING SOUTH I HAD TO GO NORTH UNTIL I FOUND MYSELF AMONG
THE AFGHANS THERE I WANDERED ABOUT FOR MANY A YEAR AND AT LAST
CAME BACK TO THE PUNJAUB WHERE I LIVED MOSTLY AMONG THE NATIVES AND
PICKED UP A LIVING BY THE CONJURING TRICKS THAT I HAD LEARNED WHAT
USE WAS IT FOR ME A WRETCHED CRIPPLE TO GO BACK TO ENGLAND OR TO
MAKE MYSELF KNOWN TO MY OLD COMRADES EVEN MY WISH FOR REVENGE WOULD
NOT MAKE ME DO THAT I HAD RATHER THAT NANCY AND MY OLD PALS SHOULD
THINK OF HARRY WOOD AS HAVING DIED WITH A STRAIGHT BACK THAN SEE HIM
LIVING AND CRAWLING WITH A STICK LIKE A CHIMPANZEE THEY NEVER
DOUBTED THAT I WAS DEAD AND I MEANT THAT THEY NEVER SHOULD I HEARD
THAT BARCLAY HAD MARRIED NANCY AND THAT HE WAS RISING RAPIDLY IN THE
REGIMENT BUT EVEN THAT DID NOT MAKE ME SPEAK
BUT WHEN ONE GETS OLD ONE HAS A LONGING FOR HOME FOR YEARS IVE
BEEN DREAMING OF THE BRIGHT GREEN FIELDS AND THE HEDGES OF ENGLAND AT
LAST I DETERMINED TO SEE THEM BEFORE I DIED I SAVED ENOUGH TO
BRING ME ACROSS AND THEN I CAME HERE WHERE THE SOLDIERS ARE FOR I
KNOW THEIR WAYS AND HOW TO AMUSE THEM AND SO EARN ENOUGH TO KEEP ME
YOUR NARRATIVE IS MOST INTERESTING SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES I HAVE
ALREADY HEARD OF YOUR MEETING WITH MRS BARCLAY AND YOUR MUTUAL
RECOGNITION YOU THEN AS I UNDERSTAND FOLLOWED HER HOME AND SAW
THROUGH THE WINDOW AN ALTERCATION BETWEEN HER HUSBAND AND HER IN
WHICH SHE DOUBTLESS CAST HIS CONDUCT TO YOU IN HIS TEETH YOUR OWN
FEELINGS OVERCAME YOU AND YOU RAN ACROSS THE LAWN AND BROKE IN UPON
THEM
I DID SIR AND AT THE SIGHT OF ME HE LOOKED AS I HAVE NEVER SEEN A
MAN LOOK BEFORE AND OVER HE WENT WITH HIS HEAD ON THE FENDER BUT
HE WAS DEAD BEFORE HE FELL I READ DEATH ON HIS FACE AS PLAIN AS I
CAN READ THAT TEXT OVER THE FIRE THE BARE SIGHT OF ME WAS LIKE A
BULLET THROUGH HIS GUILTY HEART
AND THEN
THEN NANCY FAINTED AND I CAUGHT UP THE KEY OF THE DOOR FROM HER
HAND INTENDING TO UNLOCK IT AND GET HELP BUT AS I WAS DOING IT IT
SEEMED TO ME BETTER TO LEAVE IT ALONE AND GET AWAY FOR THE THING
MIGHT LOOK BLACK AGAINST ME AND ANY WAY MY SECRET WOULD BE OUT IF I
WERE TAKEN IN MY HASTE I THRUST THE KEY INTO MY POCKET AND DROPPED
MY STICK WHILE I WAS CHASING TEDDY WHO HAD RUN UP THE CURTAIN WHEN
I GOT HIM INTO HIS BOX FROM WHICH HE HAD SLIPPED I WAS OFF AS FAST
AS I COULD RUN
WHOS TEDDY ASKED HOLMES
THE MAN LEANED OVER AND PULLED UP THE FRONT OF A KIND OF HUTCH IN THE
CORNER IN AN INSTANT OUT THERE SLIPPED A BEAUTIFUL REDDISHBROWN
CREATURE THIN AND LITHE WITH THE LEGS OF A STOAT A LONG THIN
NOSE AND A PAIR OF THE FINEST RED EYES THAT EVER I SAW IN AN
ANIMALS HEAD
ITS A MONGOOSE I CRIED
WELL SOME CALL THEM THAT AND SOME CALL THEM ICHNEUMON SAID THE
MAN SNAKECATCHER IS WHAT I CALL THEM AND TEDDY IS AMAZING QUICK
ON COBRAS I HAVE ONE HERE WITHOUT THE FANGS AND TEDDY CATCHES IT
EVERY NIGHT TO PLEASE THE FOLK IN THE CANTEEN
ANY OTHER POINT SIR
WELL WE MAY HAVE TO APPLY TO YOU AGAIN IF MRS BARCLAY SHOULD PROVE
TO BE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE
IN THAT CASE OF COURSE ID COME FORWARD
BUT IF NOT THERE IS NO OBJECT IN RAKING UP THIS SCANDAL AGAINST A
DEAD MAN FOULLY AS HE HAS ACTED YOU HAVE AT LEAST THE SATISFACTION
OF KNOWING THAT FOR THIRTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE HIS CONSCIENCE BITTERLY
REPROACHED HIM FOR THIS WICKED DEED AH THERE GOES MAJOR MURPHY ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET GOODBYE WOOD I WANT TO LEARN IF
ANYTHING HAS HAPPENED SINCE YESTERDAY
WE WERE IN TIME TO OVERTAKE THE MAJOR BEFORE HE REACHED THE CORNER
AH HOLMES HE SAID I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE HEARD THAT ALL THIS FUSS
HAS COME TO NOTHING
WHAT THEN
THE INQUEST IS JUST OVER THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE SHOWED CONCLUSIVELY
THAT DEATH WAS DUE TO APOPLEXY YOU SEE IT WAS QUITE A SIMPLE CASE
AFTER ALL
OH REMARKABLY SUPERFICIAL SAID HOLMES SMILING COME WATSON I
DONT THINK WE SHALL BE WANTED IN ALDERSHOT ANY MORE
THERES ONE THING SAID I AS WE WALKED DOWN TO THE STATION IF
THE HUSBANDS NAME WAS JAMES AND THE OTHER WAS HENRY WHAT WAS THIS
TALK ABOUT DAVID
THAT ONE WORD MY DEAR WATSON SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THE WHOLE STORY
HAD I BEEN THE IDEAL REASONER WHICH YOU ARE SO FOND OF DEPICTING IT
WAS EVIDENTLY A TERM OF REPROACH
OF REPROACH
YES DAVID STRAYED A LITTLE OCCASIONALLY YOU KNOW AND ON ONE
OCCASION IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS SERGEANT JAMES BARCLAY YOU
REMEMBER THE SMALL AFFAIR OF URIAH AND BATHSHEBA MY BIBLICAL
KNOWLEDGE IS A TRIFLE RUSTY I FEAR BUT YOU WILL FIND THE STORY IN
THE FIRST OR SECOND OF SAMUEL
THE RESIDENT PATIENT
GLANCING OVER THE SOMEWHAT INCOHERENT SERIES OF MEMOIRS WITH WHICH I
HAVE ENDEAVORED TO ILLUSTRATE A FEW OF THE MENTAL PECULIARITIES OF MY
FRIEND MR SHERLOCK HOLMES I HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY THE DIFFICULTY
WHICH I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN PICKING OUT EXAMPLES WHICH SHALL IN EVERY
WAY ANSWER MY PURPOSE FOR IN THOSE CASES IN WHICH HOLMES HAS
PERFORMED SOME TOUR DE FORCE OF ANALYTICAL REASONING AND HAS
DEMONSTRATED THE VALUE OF HIS PECULIAR METHODS OF INVESTIGATION THE
FACTS THEMSELVES HAVE OFTEN BEEN SO SLIGHT OR SO COMMONPLACE THAT I
COULD NOT FEEL JUSTIFIED IN LAYING THEM BEFORE THE PUBLIC ON THE
OTHER HAND IT HAS FREQUENTLY HAPPENED THAT HE HAS BEEN CONCERNED IN
SOME RESEARCH WHERE THE FACTS HAVE BEEN OF THE MOST REMARKABLE AND
DRAMATIC CHARACTER BUT WHERE THE SHARE WHICH HE HAS HIMSELF TAKEN IN
DETERMINING THEIR CAUSES HAS BEEN LESS PRONOUNCED THAN I AS HIS
BIOGRAPHER COULD WISH THE SMALL MATTER WHICH I HAVE CHRONICLED
UNDER THE HEADING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET AND THAT OTHER LATER ONE
CONNECTED WITH THE LOSS OF THE GLORIA SCOTT MAY SERVE AS EXAMPLES OF
THIS SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS WHICH ARE FOREVER THREATENING THE
HISTORIAN IT MAY BE THAT IN THE BUSINESS OF WHICH I AM NOW ABOUT TO
WRITE THE PART WHICH MY FRIEND PLAYED IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY
ACCENTUATED AND YET THE WHOLE TRAIN OF CIRCUMSTANCES IS SO
REMARKABLE THAT I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO OMIT IT ENTIRELY FROM THIS
SERIES
IT HAD BEEN A CLOSE RAINY DAY IN OCTOBER OUR BLINDS WERE
HALFDRAWN AND HOLMES LAY CURLED UPON THE SOFA READING AND
REREADING A LETTER WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED BY THE MORNING POST FOR
MYSELF MY TERM OF SERVICE IN INDIA HAD TRAINED ME TO STAND HEAT
BETTER THAN COLD AND A THERMOMETER OF WAS NO HARDSHIP BUT THE
PAPER WAS UNINTERESTING PARLIAMENT HAD RISEN EVERYBODY WAS OUT OF
TOWN AND I YEARNED FOR THE GLADES OF THE NEW FOREST OR THE SHINGLE
OF SOUTHSEA A DEPLETED BANK ACCOUNT HAD CAUSED ME TO POSTPONE MY
HOLIDAY AND AS TO MY COMPANION NEITHER THE COUNTRY NOR THE SEA
PRESENTED THE SLIGHTEST ATTRACTION TO HIM HE LOVED TO LIE IN THE
VERY CENTRE OF FIVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WITH HIS FILAMENTS STRETCHING
OUT AND RUNNING THROUGH THEM RESPONSIVE TO EVERY LITTLE RUMOR OR
SUSPICION OF UNSOLVED CRIME APPRECIATION OF NATURE FOUND NO PLACE
AMONG HIS MANY GIFTS AND HIS ONLY CHANGE WAS WHEN HE TURNED HIS MIND
FROM THE EVILDOER OF THE TOWN TO TRACK DOWN HIS BROTHER OF THE
COUNTRY
I CANNOT BE SURE OF THE EXACT DATE FOR SOME OF MY MEMORANDA UPON THE
MATTER HAVE BEEN MISLAID BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN TOWARDS THE END OF
THE FIRST YEAR DURING WHICH HOLMES AND I SHARED CHAMBERS IN BAKER
STREET IT WAS BOISTEROUS OCTOBER WEATHER AND WE HAD BOTH REMAINED
INDOORS ALL DAY I BECAUSE I FEARED WITH MY SHAKEN HEALTH TO FACE THE
KEEN AUTUMN WIND WHILE HE WAS DEEP IN SOME OF THOSE ABSTRUSE
CHEMICAL INVESTIGATIONS WHICH ABSORBED HIM UTTERLY AS LONG AS HE WAS
ENGAGED UPON THEM TOWARDS EVENING HOWEVER THE BREAKING OF A
TESTTUBE BROUGHT HIS RESEARCH TO A PREMATURE ENDING AND HE SPRANG
UP FROM HIS CHAIR WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF IMPATIENCE AND A CLOUDED
BROW
A DAYS WORK RUINED WATSON SAID HE STRIDING ACROSS TO THE
WINDOW HA THE STARS ARE OUT AND HE WIND HAS FALLEN WHAT DO YOU
SAY TO A RAMBLE THROUGH LONDON
I WAS WEARY OF OUR LITTLE SITTINGROOM AND GLADLY ACQUIESCED FOR
THREE HOURS WE STROLLED ABOUT TOGETHER WATCHING THE EVERCHANGING
KALEIDOSCOPE OF LIFE AS IT EBBS AND FLOWS THROUGH FLEET STREET AND
THE STRAND HIS CHARACTERISTIC TALK WITH ITS KEEN OBSERVANCE OF
DETAIL AND SUBTLE POWER OF INFERENCE HELD ME AMUSED AND ENTHRALLED
IT WAS TEN OCLOCK BEFORE WE REACHED BAKER STREET AGAIN A BROUGHAM
WAS WAITING AT OUR DOOR
HUM A DOCTORSGENERAL PRACTITIONER I PERCEIVE SAID HOLMES
NOT BEEN LONG IN PRACTICE BUT HAS HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO COME TO
CONSULT US I FANCY LUCKY WE CAME BACK
I WAS SUFFICIENTLY CONVERSANT WITH HOLMESS METHODS TO BE ABLE TO
FOLLOW HIS REASONING AND TO SEE THAT THE NATURE AND STATE OF THE
VARIOUS MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE WICKER BASKET WHICH HUNG IN THE
LAMPLIGHT INSIDE THE BROUGHAM HAD GIVEN HIM THE DATA FOR HIS SWIFT
DEDUCTION THE LIGHT IN OUR WINDOW ABOVE SHOWED THAT THIS LATE VISIT
WAS INDEED INTENDED FOR US WITH SOME CURIOSITY AS TO WHAT COULD HAVE
SENT A BROTHER MEDICO TO US AT SUCH AN HOUR I FOLLOWED HOLMES INTO
OUR SANCTUM
A PALE TAPERFACED MAN WITH SANDY WHISKERS ROSE UP FROM A CHAIR BY
THE FIRE AS WE ENTERED HIS AGE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THREE OR
FOUR AND THIRTY BUT HIS HAGGARD EXPRESSION AND UNHEALTHY HUE TOLD OF
A LIFE WHICH HAS SAPPED HIS STRENGTH AND ROBBED HIM OF HIS YOUTH HIS
MANNER WAS NERVOUS AND SHY LIKE THAT OF A SENSITIVE GENTLEMAN AND
THE THIN WHITE HAND WHICH HE LAID ON THE MANTELPIECE AS HE ROSE WAS
THAT OF AN ARTIST RATHER THAN OF A SURGEON HIS DRESS WAS QUIET AND
SOMBREA BLACK FROCKCOAT DARK TROUSERS AND A TOUCH OF COLOR ABOUT
HIS NECKTIE
GOODEVENING DOCTOR SAID HOLMES CHEERILY I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT
YOU HAVE ONLY BEEN WAITING A VERY FEW MINUTES
YOU SPOKE TO MY COACHMAN THEN
NO IT WAS THE CANDLE ON THE SIDETABLE THAT TOLD ME PRAY RESUME
YOUR SEAT AND LET ME KNOW HOW I CAN SERVE YOU
MY NAME IS DOCTOR PERCY TREVELYAN SAID OUR VISITOR AND I LIVE AT
BROOK STREET
ARE YOU NOT THE AUTHOR OF A MONOGRAPH UPON OBSCURE NERVOUS LESIONS
I ASKED
HIS PALE CHEEKS FLUSHED WITH PLEASURE AT HEARING THAT HIS WORK WAS
KNOWN TO ME
I SO SELDOM HEAR OF THE WORK THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE DEAD SAID
HE MY PUBLISHERS GAVE ME A MOST DISCOURAGING ACCOUNT OF ITS SALE
YOU ARE YOURSELF I PRESUME A MEDICAL MAN
A RETIRED ARMY SURGEON
MY OWN HOBBY HAS ALWAYS BEEN NERVOUS DISEASE I SHOULD WISH TO MAKE
IT AN ABSOLUTE SPECIALTY BUT OF COURSE A MAN MUST TAKE WHAT HE CAN
GET AT FIRST THIS HOWEVER IS BESIDE THE QUESTION MR SHERLOCK
HOLMES AND I QUITE APPRECIATE HOW VALUABLE YOUR TIME IS THE FACT IS
THAT A VERY SINGULAR TRAIN OF EVENTS HAS OCCURRED RECENTLY AT MY
HOUSE IN BROOK STREET AND TONIGHT THEY CAME TO SUCH A HEAD THAT I
FELT IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO WAIT ANOTHER HOUR BEFORE
ASKING FOR YOUR ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT DOWN AND LIT HIS PIPE YOU ARE VERY WELCOME TO
BOTH SAID HE PRAY LET ME HAVE A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF WHAT THE
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WHICH HAVE DISTURBED YOU
ONE OR TWO OF THEM ARE SO TRIVIAL SAID DR TREVELYAN THAT REALLY
I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO MENTION THEM BUT THE MATTER IS SO
INEXPLICABLE AND THE RECENT TURN WHICH IT HAS TAKEN IS SO ELABORATE
THAT I SHALL LAY IT ALL BEFORE YOU AND YOU SHALL JUDGE WHAT IS
ESSENTIAL AND WHAT IS NOT
I AM COMPELLED TO BEGIN WITH TO SAY SOMETHING OF MY OWN COLLEGE
CAREER I AM A LONDON UNIVERSITY MAN YOU KNOW AND I AM SURE THAT
YOU WILL NOT THINK THAT I AM UNDULY SINGING MY OWN PRAISES IF I SAY
THAT MY STUDENT CAREER WAS CONSIDERED BY MY PROFESSORS TO BE A VERY
PROMISING ONE AFTER I HAD GRADUATED I CONTINUED TO DEVOTE MYSELF TO
RESEARCH OCCUPYING A MINOR POSITION IN KINGS COLLEGE HOSPITAL AND
I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO EXCITE CONSIDERABLE INTEREST BY MY RESEARCH
INTO THE PATHOLOGY OF CATALEPSY AND FINALLY TO WIN THE BRUCE
PINKERTON PRIZE AND MEDAL BY THE MONOGRAPH ON NERVOUS LESIONS TO
WHICH YOUR FRIEND HAS JUST ALLUDED I SHOULD NOT GO TOO FAR IF I WERE
TO SAY THAT THERE WAS A GENERAL IMPRESSION AT THAT TIME THAT A
DISTINGUISHED CAREER LAY BEFORE ME
BUT THE ONE GREAT STUMBLINGBLOCK LAY IN MY WANT OF CAPITAL AS YOU
WILL READILY UNDERSTAND A SPECIALIST WHO AIMS HIGH IS COMPELLED TO
START IN ONE OF A DOZEN STREETS IN THE CAVENDISH SQUARE QUARTER ALL
OF WHICH ENTAIL ENORMOUS RENTS AND FURNISHING EXPENSES BESIDES THIS
PRELIMINARY OUTLAY HE MUST BE PREPARED TO KEEP HIMSELF FOR SOME
YEARS AND TO HIRE A PRESENTABLE CARRIAGE AND HORSE TO DO THIS WAS
QUITE BEYOND MY POWER AND I COULD ONLY HOPE THAT BY ECONOMY I MIGHT
IN TEN YEARS TIME SAVE ENOUGH TO ENABLE ME TO PUT UP MY PLATE
SUDDENLY HOWEVER AN UNEXPECTED INCIDENT OPENED UP QUITE A NEW
PROSPECT TO ME
THIS WAS A VISIT FROM A GENTLEMAN OF THE NAME OF BLESSINGTON WHO
WAS A COMPLETE STRANGER TO ME HE CAME UP TO MY ROOM ONE MORNING AND
PLUNGED INTO BUSINESS IN AN INSTANT
YOU ARE THE SAME PERCY TREVELYAN WHO HAS HAD SO DISTINGUISHED A
CAREER AND WON A GREAT PRIZE LATELY SAID HE
I BOWED
ANSWER ME FRANKLY HE CONTINUED FOR YOU WILL FIND IT TO YOUR
INTEREST TO DO SO YOU HAVE ALL THE CLEVERNESS WHICH MAKES A
SUCCESSFUL MAN HAVE YOU THE TACT
I COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE ABRUPTNESS OF THE QUESTION
I TRUST THAT I HAVE MY SHARE I SAID
ANY BAD HABITS NOT DRAWN TOWARDS DRINK EH
REALLY SIR I CRIED
QUITE RIGHT THATS ALL RIGHT BUT I WAS BOUND TO ASK WITH ALL
THESE QUALITIES WHY ARE YOU NOT IN PRACTICE
I SHRUGGED MY SHOULDERS
COME COME SAID HE IN HIS BUSTLING WAY ITS THE OLD STORY
MORE IN YOUR BRAINS THAN IN YOUR POCKET EH WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I
WERE TO START YOU IN BROOK STREET
I STARED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
OH ITS FOR MY SAKE NOT FOR YOURS HE CRIED ILL BE PERFECTLY
FRANK WITH YOU AND IF IT SUITS YOU IT WILL SUIT ME VERY WELL I HAVE
A FEW THOUSANDS TO INVEST DYE SEE AND I THINK ILL SINK THEM IN
YOU
BUT WHY I GASPED
WELL ITS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SPECULATION AND SAFER THAN MOST
WHAT AM I TO DO THEN
ILL TELL YOU ILL TAKE THE HOUSE FURNISH IT PAY THE MAIDS AND
RUN THE WHOLE PLACE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST TO WEAR OUT YOUR
CHAIR IN THE CONSULTINGROOM ILL LET YOU HAVE POCKETMONEY AND
EVERYTHING THEN YOU HAND OVER TO ME THREE QUARTERS OF WHAT YOU EARN
AND YOU KEEP THE OTHER QUARTER FOR YOURSELF
THIS WAS THE STRANGE PROPOSAL MR HOLMES WITH WHICH THE MAN
BLESSINGTON APPROACHED ME I WONT WEARY YOU WITH THE ACCOUNT OF HOW
WE BARGAINED AND NEGOTIATED IT ENDED IN MY MOVING INTO THE HOUSE
NEXT LADY DAY AND STARTING IN PRACTICE ON VERY MUCH THE SAME
CONDITIONS AS HE HAD SUGGESTED HE CAME HIMSELF TO LIVE WITH ME IN
THE CHARACTER OF A RESIDENT PATIENT HIS HEART WAS WEAK IT APPEARS
AND HE NEEDED CONSTANT MEDICAL SUPERVISION HE TURNED THE TWO BEST
ROOMS OF THE FIRST FLOOR INTO A SITTINGROOM AND BEDROOM FOR HIMSELF
HE WAS A MAN OF SINGULAR HABITS SHUNNING COMPANY AND VERY SELDOM
GOING OUT HIS LIFE WAS IRREGULAR BUT IN ONE RESPECT HE WAS
REGULARITY ITSELF EVERY EVENING AT THE SAME HOUR HE WALKED INTO
THE CONSULTINGROOM EXAMINED THE BOOKS PUT DOWN FIVE AND
THREEPENCE FOR EVERY GUINEA THAT I HAD EARNED AND CARRIED THE REST
OFF TO THE STRONGBOX IN HIS OWN ROOM
I MAY SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT HE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO REGRET HIS
SPECULATION FROM THE FIRST IT WAS A SUCCESS A FEW GOOD CASES AND
THE REPUTATION WHICH I HAD WON IN THE HOSPITAL BROUGHT ME RAPIDLY TO
THE FRONT AND DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS I HAVE MADE HIM A RICH MAN
SO MUCH MR HOLMES FOR MY PAST HISTORY AND MY RELATIONS WITH MR
BLESSINGTON IT ONLY REMAINS FOR ME NOW TO TELL YOU WHAT HAS OCCURRED
TO BRING ME HERE TONIGHT
SOME WEEKS AGO MR BLESSINGTON CAME DOWN TO ME IN AS IT SEEMED TO
ME A STATE OF CONSIDERABLE AGITATION HE SPOKE OF SOME BURGLARY
WHICH HE SAID HAD BEEN COMMITTED IN THE WEST END AND HE APPEARED
I REMEMBER TO BE QUITE UNNECESSARILY EXCITED ABOUT IT DECLARING
THAT A DAY SHOULD NOT PASS BEFORE WE SHOULD ADD STRONGER BOLTS TO OUR
WINDOWS AND DOORS FOR A WEEK HE CONTINUED TO BE IN A PECULIAR STATE
OF RESTLESSNESS PEERING CONTINUALLY OUT OF THE WINDOWS AND CEASING
TO TAKE THE SHORT WALK WHICH HAD USUALLY BEEN THE PRELUDE TO HIS
DINNER FROM HIS MANNER IT STRUCK ME THAT HE WAS IN MORTAL DREAD OF
SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY BUT WHEN I QUESTIONED HIM UPON THE POINT HE
BECAME SO OFFENSIVE THAT I WAS COMPELLED TO DROP THE SUBJECT
GRADUALLY AS TIME PASSED HIS FEARS APPEARED TO DIE AWAY AND HE HAD
RENEWED HIS FORMER HABITS WHEN A FRESH EVENT REDUCED HIM TO THE
PITIABLE STATE OF PROSTRATION IN WHICH HE NOW LIES
WHAT HAPPENED WAS THIS TWO DAYS AGO I RECEIVED THE LETTER WHICH I
NOW READ TO YOU NEITHER ADDRESS NOR DATE IS ATTACHED TO IT
A RUSSIAN NOBLEMAN WHO IS NOW RESIDENT IN ENGLAND IT RUNS WOULD
BE GLAD TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANCE OF DR PERCY
TREVELYAN HE HAS BEEN FOR SOME YEARS A VICTIM TO CATALEPTIC ATTACKS
ON WHICH AS IS WELL KNOWN DR TREVELYAN IS AN AUTHORITY HE
PROPOSES TO CALL AT ABOUT QUARTER PAST SIX TOMORROW EVENING IF DR
TREVELYAN WILL MAKE IT CONVENIENT TO BE AT HOME
THIS LETTER INTERESTED ME DEEPLY BECAUSE THE CHIEF DIFFICULTY IN
THE STUDY OF CATALEPSY IS THE RARENESS OF THE DISEASE YOU MAY
BELIEVE THAN THAT I WAS IN MY CONSULTINGROOM WHEN AT THE
APPOINTED HOUR THE PAGE SHOWED IN THE PATIENT
HE WAS AN ELDERLY MAN THIN DEMURE AND COMMONPLACEBY NO MEANS
THE CONCEPTION ONE FORMS OF A RUSSIAN NOBLEMAN I WAS MUCH MORE
STRUCK BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS COMPANION THIS WAS A TALL YOUNG MAN
SURPRISINGLY HANDSOME WITH A DARK FIERCE FACE AND THE LIMBS AND
CHEST OF A HERCULES HE HAD HIS HAND UNDER THE OTHERS ARM AS THEY
ENTERED AND HELPED HIM TO A CHAIR WITH A TENDERNESS WHICH ONE WOULD
HARDLY HAVE EXPECTED FROM HIS APPEARANCE
YOU WILL EXCUSE MY COMING IN DOCTOR SAID HE TO ME SPEAKING
ENGLISH WITH A SLIGHT LISP THIS IS MY FATHER AND HIS HEALTH IS A
MATTER OF THE MOST OVERWHELMING IMPORTANCE TO ME
I WAS TOUCHED BY THIS FILIAL ANXIETY YOU WOULD PERHAPS CARE TO
REMAIN DURING THE CONSULTATION SAID I
NOT FOR THE WORLD HE CRIED WITH A GESTURE OF HORROR IT IS MORE
PAINFUL TO ME THAN I CAN EXPRESS IF I WERE TO SEE MY FATHER IN ONE
OF THESE DREADFUL SEIZURES I AM CONVINCED THAT I SHOULD NEVER SURVIVE
IT MY OWN NERVOUS SYSTEM IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY SENSITIVE ONE WITH
YOUR PERMISSION I WILL REMAIN IN THE WAITINGROOM WHILE YOU GO INTO
MY FATHERS CASE
TO THIS OF COURSE I ASSENTED AND THE YOUNG MAN WITHDREW THE
PATIENT AND I THEN PLUNGED INTO A DISCUSSION OF HIS CASE OF WHICH I
TOOK EXHAUSTIVE NOTES HE WAS NOT REMARKABLE FOR INTELLIGENCE AND
HIS ANSWERS WERE FREQUENTLY OBSCURE WHICH I ATTRIBUTED TO HIS
LIMITED ACQUAINTANCE WITH OUR LANGUAGE SUDDENLY HOWEVER AS I SAT
WRITING HE CEASED TO GIVE ANY ANSWER AT ALL TO MY INQUIRIES AND ON
MY TURNING TOWARDS HIM I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THAT HE WAS SITTING BOLT
UPRIGHT IN HIS CHAIR STARING AT ME WITH A PERFECTLY BLANK AND RIGID
FACE HE WAS AGAIN IN THE GRIP OF HIS MYSTERIOUS MALADY
MY FIRST FEELING AS I HAVE JUST SAID WAS ONE OF PITY AND HORROR
MY SECOND I FEAR WAS RATHER ONE OF PROFESSIONAL SATISFACTION I
MADE NOTES OF MY PATIENTS PULSE AND TEMPERATURE TESTED THE RIGIDITY
OF HIS MUSCLES AND EXAMINED HIS REFLEXES THERE WAS NOTHING MARKEDLY
ABNORMAL IN ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS WHICH HARMONIZED WITH MY FORMER
EXPERIENCES I HAD OBTAINED GOOD RESULTS IN SUCH CASES BY THE
INHALATION OF NITRITE OF AMYL AND THE PRESENT SEEMED AN ADMIRABLE
OPPORTUNITY OF TESTING ITS VIRTUES THE BOTTLE WAS DOWNSTAIRS IN MY
LABORATORY SO LEAVING MY PATIENT SEATED IN HIS CHAIR I RAN DOWN TO
GET IT THERE WAS SOME LITTLE DELAY IN FINDING ITFIVE MINUTES LET
US SAYAND THEN I RETURNED IMAGINE MY AMAZEMENT TO FIND THE ROOM
EMPTY AND THE PATIENT GONE
OF COURSE MY FIRST ACT WAS TO RUN INTO THE WAITINGROOM THE SON
HAD GONE ALSO THE HALL DOOR HAD BEEN CLOSED BUT NOT SHUT MY PAGE
WHO ADMITS PATIENTS IS A NEW BOY AND BY NO MEANS QUICK HE WAITS
DOWNSTAIRS AND RUNS UP TO SHOW PATIENTS OUT WHEN I RING THE
CONSULTINGROOM BELL HE HAD HEARD NOTHING AND THE AFFAIR REMAINED A
COMPLETE MYSTERY MR BLESSINGTON CAME IN FROM HIS WALK SHORTLY
AFTERWARDS BUT I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING TO HIM UPON THE SUBJECT FOR
TO TELL THE TRUTH I HAVE GOT IN THE WAY OF LATE OF HOLDING AS LITTLE
COMMUNICATION WITH HIM AS POSSIBLE
WELL I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD SEE ANYTHING MORE OF THE RUSSIAN
AND HIS SON SO YOU CAN IMAGINE MY AMAZEMENT WHEN AT THE VERY SAME
HOUR THIS EVENING THEY BOTH CAME MARCHING INTO MY CONSULTINGROOM
JUST AS THEY HAD DONE BEFORE
I FEEL THAT I OWE YOU A GREAT MANY APOLOGIES FOR MY ABRUPT
DEPARTURE YESTERDAY DOCTOR SAID MY PATIENT
I CONFESS THAT I WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED AT IT SAID I
WELL THE FACT IS HE REMARKED THAT WHEN I RECOVER FROM THESE
ATTACKS MY MIND IS ALWAYS VERY CLOUDED AS TO ALL THAT HAS GONE
BEFORE I WOKE UP IN A STRANGE ROOM AS IT SEEMED TO ME AND MADE MY
WAY OUT INTO THE STREET IN A SORT OF DAZED WAY WHEN YOU WERE ABSENT
AND I SAID THE SON SEEING MY FATHER PASS THE DOOR OF THE
WAITINGROOM NATURALLY THOUGHT THAT THE CONSULTATION HAD COME TO AN
END IT WAS NOT UNTIL WE HAD REACHED HOME THAT I BEGAN TO REALIZE THE
TRUE STATE OF AFFAIRS
WELL SAID I LAUGHING THERE IS NO HARM DONE EXCEPT THAT YOU
PUZZLED ME TERRIBLY SO IF YOU SIR WOULD KINDLY STEP INTO THE
WAITINGROOM I SHALL BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE OUR CONSULTATION WHICH WAS
BROUGHT TO SO ABRUPT AN ENDING
FOR HALF AN HOUR OR SO I DISCUSSED THAT OLD GENTLEMANS SYMPTOMS
WITH HIM AND THEN HAVING PRESCRIBED FOR HIM I SAW HIM GO OFF UPON
THE ARM OF HIS SON
I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT MR BLESSINGTON GENERALLY CHOSE THIS HOUR OF
THE DAY FOR HIS EXERCISE HE CAME IN SHORTLY AFTERWARDS AND PASSED
UPSTAIRS AN INSTANT LATER I HEARD HIM RUNNING DOWN AND HE BURST
INTO MY CONSULTINGROOM LIKE A MAN WHO IS MAD WITH PANIC
WHO HAS BEEN IN MY ROOM HE CRIED
NO ONE SAID I
ITS A LIE HE YELLED COME UP AND LOOK
I PASSED OVER THE GROSSNESS OF HIS LANGUAGE AS HE SEEMED HALF OUT
OF HIS MIND WITH FEAR WHEN I WENT UPSTAIRS WITH HIM HE POINTED TO
SEVERAL FOOTPRINTS UPON THE LIGHT CARPET
DYOU MEAN TO SAY THOSE ARE MINE HE CRIED
THEY WERE CERTAINLY VERY MUCH LARGER THAN ANY WHICH HE COULD HAVE
MADE AND WERE EVIDENTLY QUITE FRESH IT RAINED HARD THIS AFTERNOON
AS YOU KNOW AND MY PATIENTS WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CALLED IT MUST
HAVE BEEN THE CASE THEN THAT THE MAN IN THE WAITINGROOM HAD FOR
SOME UNKNOWN REASON WHILE I WAS BUSY WITH THE OTHER ASCENDED TO THE
ROOM OF MY RESIDENT PATIENT NOTHING HAS BEEN TOUCHED OR TAKEN BUT
THERE WERE THE FOOTPRINTS TO PROVE THAT THE INTRUSION WAS AN
UNDOUBTED FACT
MR BLESSINGTON SEEMED MORE EXCITED OVER THE MATTER THAN I SHOULD
HAVE THOUGHT POSSIBLE THOUGH OF COURSE IT WAS ENOUGH TO DISTURB
ANYBODYS PEACE OF MIND HE ACTUALLY SAT CRYING IN AN ARMCHAIR AND
I COULD HARDLY GET HIM TO SPEAK COHERENTLY IT WAS HIS SUGGESTION
THAT I SHOULD COME ROUND TO YOU AND OF COURSE I AT ONCE SAW THE
PROPRIETY OF IT FOR CERTAINLY THE INCIDENT IS A VERY SINGULAR ONE
THOUGH HE APPEARS TO COMPLETELY OVERRATE ITS IMPORTANCE IF YOU WOULD
ONLY COME BACK WITH ME IN MY BROUGHAM YOU WOULD AT LEAST BE ABLE TO
SOOTHE HIM THOUGH I CAN HARDLY HOPE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN
THIS REMARKABLE OCCURRENCE
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD LISTENED TO THIS LONG NARRATIVE WITH AN
INTENTNESS WHICH SHOWED ME THAT HIS INTEREST WAS KEENLY AROUSED HIS
FACE WAS AS IMPASSIVE AS EVER BUT HIS LIDS HAD DROOPED MORE HEAVILY
OVER HIS EYES AND HIS SMOKE HAD CURLED UP MORE THICKLY FROM HIS PIPE
TO EMPHASIZE EACH CURIOUS EPISODE IN THE DOCTORS TALE AS OUR
VISITOR CONCLUDED HOLMES SPRANG UP WITHOUT A WORD HANDED ME MY HAT
PICKED HIS OWN FROM THE TABLE AND FOLLOWED DR TREVELYAN TO THE
DOOR WITHIN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WE HAD BEEN DROPPED AT THE DOOR OF
THE PHYSICIANS RESIDENCE IN BROOK STREET ONE OF THOSE SOMBRE
FLATFACED HOUSES WHICH ONE ASSOCIATES WITH A WESTEND PRACTICE A
SMALL PAGE ADMITTED US AND WE BEGAN AT ONCE TO ASCEND THE BROAD
WELLCARPETED STAIR
BUT A SINGULAR INTERRUPTION BROUGHT US TO A STANDSTILL THE LIGHT AT
THE TOP WAS SUDDENLY WHISKED OUT AND FROM THE DARKNESS CAME A REEDY
QUIVERING VOICE
I HAVE A PISTOL IT CRIED I GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT ILL FIRE IF
YOU COME ANY NEARER
THIS REALLY GROWS OUTRAGEOUS MR BLESSINGTON CRIED DR TREVELYAN
OH THEN IT IS YOU DOCTOR SAID THE VOICE WITH A GREAT HEAVE OF
RELIEF BUT THOSE OTHER GENTLEMEN ARE THEY WHAT THEY PRETEND TO
BE
WE WERE CONSCIOUS OF A LONG SCRUTINY OUT OF THE DARKNESS
YES YES ITS ALL RIGHT SAID THE VOICE AT LAST YOU CAN COME UP
AND I AM SORRY IF MY PRECAUTIONS HAVE ANNOYED YOU
HE RELIT THE STAIR GAS AS HE SPOKE AND WE SAW BEFORE US A
SINGULARLOOKING MAN WHOSE APPEARANCE AS WELL AS HIS VOICE
TESTIFIED TO HIS JANGLED NERVES HE WAS VERY FAT BUT HAD APPARENTLY
AT SOME TIME BEEN MUCH FATTER SO THAT THE SKIN HUNG ABOUT HIS FACE
IN LOOSE POUCHES LIKE THE CHEEKS OF A BLOODHOUND HE WAS OF A
SICKLY COLOR AND HIS THIN SANDY HAIR SEEMED TO BRISTLE UP WITH THE
INTENSITY OF HIS EMOTION IN HIS HAND HE HELD A PISTOL BUT HE THRUST
IT INTO HIS POCKET AS WE ADVANCED
GOODEVENING MR HOLMES SAID HE I AM SURE I AM VERY MUCH
OBLIGED TO YOU FOR COMING ROUND NO ONE EVER NEEDED YOUR ADVICE MORE
THAN I DO I SUPPOSE THAT DR TREVELYAN HAS TOLD YOU OF THIS MOST
UNWARRANTABLE INTRUSION INTO MY ROOMS
QUITE SO SAID HOLMES WHO ARE THESE TWO MEN MR BLESSINGTON AND
WHY DO THEY WISH TO MOLEST YOU
WELL WELL SAID THE RESIDENT PATIENT IN A NERVOUS FASHION OF
COURSE IT IS HARD TO SAY THAT YOU CAN HARDLY EXPECT ME TO ANSWER
THAT MR HOLMES
DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU DONT KNOW
COME IN HERE IF YOU PLEASE JUST HAVE THE KINDNESS TO STEP IN
HERE
HE LED THE WAY INTO HIS BEDROOM WHICH WAS LARGE AND COMFORTABLY
FURNISHED
YOU SEE THAT SAID HE POINTING TO A BIG BLACK BOX AT THE END OF
HIS BED I HAVE NEVER BEEN A VERY RICH MAN MR HOLMESNEVER MADE
BUT ONE INVESTMENT IN MY LIFE AS DR TREVELYAN WOULD TELL YOU BUT I
DONT BELIEVE IN BANKERS I WOULD NEVER TRUST A BANKER MR HOLMES
BETWEEN OURSELVES WHAT LITTLE I HAVE IS IN THAT BOX SO YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO ME WHEN UNKNOWN PEOPLE FORCE THEMSELVES
INTO MY ROOMS
HOLMES LOOKED AT BLESSINGTON IN HIS QUESTIONING WAY AND SHOOK HIS
HEAD
I CANNOT POSSIBLY ADVISE YOU IF YOU TRY TO DECEIVE ME SAID HE
BUT I HAVE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
HOLMES TURNED ON HIS HEEL WITH A GESTURE OF DISGUST GOODNIGHT DR
TREVELYAN SAID HE
AND NO ADVICE FOR ME CRIED BLESSINGTON IN A BREAKING VOICE
MY ADVICE TO YOUR SIR IS TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
A MINUTE LATER WE WERE IN THE STREET AND WALKING FOR HOME WE HAD
CROSSED OXFORD STREET AND WERE HALF WAY DOWN HARLEY STREET BEFORE I
COULD GET A WORD FROM MY COMPANION
SORRY TO BRING YOU OUT ON SUCH A FOOLS ERRAND WATSON HE SAID AT
LAST IT IS AN INTERESTING CASE TOO AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
I CAN MAKE LITTLE OF IT I CONFESSED
WELL IT IS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THERE ARE TWO MENMORE PERHAPS BUT
AT LEAST TWOWHO ARE DETERMINED FOR SOME REASON TO GET AT THIS
FELLOW BLESSINGTON I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT BOTH ON THE FIRST
AND ON THE SECOND OCCASION THAT YOUNG MAN PENETRATED TO BLESSINGTONS
ROOM WHILE HIS CONFEDERATE BY AN INGENIOUS DEVICE KEPT THE DOCTOR
FROM INTERFERING
AND THE CATALEPSY
A FRAUDULENT IMITATION WATSON THOUGH I SHOULD HARDLY DARE TO HINT
AS MUCH TO OUR SPECIALIST IT IS A VERY EASY COMPLAINT TO IMITATE I
HAVE DONE IT MYSELF
AND THEN
BY THE PUREST CHANCE BLESSINGTON WAS OUT ON EACH OCCASION THEIR
REASON FOR CHOOSING SO UNUSUAL AN HOUR FOR A CONSULTATION WAS
OBVIOUSLY TO INSURE THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO OTHER PATIENT IN THE
WAITINGROOM IT JUST HAPPENED HOWEVER THAT THIS HOUR COINCIDED
WITH BLESSINGTONS CONSTITUTIONAL WHICH SEEMS TO SHOW THAT THEY WERE
NOT VERY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIS DAILY ROUTINE OF COURSE IF THEY
HAD BEEN MERELY AFTER PLUNDER THEY WOULD AT LEAST HAVE MADE SOME
ATTEMPT TO SEARCH FOR IT BESIDES I CAN READ IN A MANS EYE WHEN IT
IS HIS OWN SKIN THAT HE IS FRIGHTENED FOR IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT
THIS FELLOW COULD HAVE MADE TWO SUCH VINDICTIVE ENEMIES AS THESE
APPEAR TO BE WITHOUT KNOWING OF IT I HOLD IT THEREFORE TO BE
CERTAIN THAT HE DOES KNOW WHO THESE MEN ARE AND THAT FOR REASONS OF
HIS OWN HE SUPPRESSES IT IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT TOMORROW MAY FIND
HIM IN A MORE COMMUNICATIVE MOOD
IS THERE NOT ONE ALTERNATIVE I SUGGESTED GROTESQUELY IMPROBABLY
NO DOUBT BUT STILL JUST CONCEIVABLE MIGHT THE WHOLE STORY OF THE
CATALEPTIC RUSSIAN AND HIS SON BE A CONCOCTION OF DR TREVELYANS
WHO HAS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES BEEN IN BLESSINGTONS ROOMS
I SAW IN THE GASLIGHT THAT HOLMES WORE AN AMUSED SMILE AT THIS
BRILLIANT DEPARTURE OF MINE
MY DEAR FELLOW SAID HE IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SOLUTIONS WHICH
OCCURRED TO ME BUT I WAS SOON ABLE TO CORROBORATE THE DOCTORS TALE
THIS YOUNG MAN HAS LEFT PRINTS UPON THE STAIRCARPET WHICH MADE IT
QUITE SUPERFLUOUS FOR ME TO ASK TO SEE THOSE WHICH HE HAD MADE IN THE
ROOM WHEN I TELL YOU THAT HIS SHOES WERE SQUARETOED INSTEAD OF
BEING POINTED LIKE BLESSINGTONS AND WERE QUITE AN INCH AND A THIRD
LONGER THAN THE DOCTORS YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE CAN BE NO
DOUBT AS TO HIS INDIVIDUALITY BUT WE MAY SLEEP ON IT NOW FOR I
SHALL BE SURPRISED IF WE DO NOT HEAR SOMETHING FURTHER FROM BROOK
STREET IN THE MORNING
SHERLOCK HOLMESS PROPHECY WAS SOON FULFILLED AND IN A DRAMATIC
FASHION AT HALFPAST SEVEN NEXT MORNING IN THE FIRST GLIMMER OF
DAYLIGHT I FOUND HIM STANDING BY MY BEDSIDE IN HIS DRESSINGGOWN
THERES A BROUGHAM WAITING FOR US WATSON SAID HE
WHATS THE MATTER THEN
THE BROOK STREET BUSINESS
ANY FRESH NEWS
TRAGIC BUT AMBIGUOUS SAID HE PULLING UP THE BLIND LOOK AT
THISA SHEET FROM A NOTEBOOK WITH FOR GODS SAKE COME AT ONCEP
T SCRAWLED UPON IT IN PENCIL OUR FRIEND THE DOCTOR WAS HARD PUT
TO IT WHEN HE WROTE THIS COME ALONG MY DEAR FELLOW FOR ITS AN
URGENT CALL
IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR SO WE WERE BACK AT THE PHYSICIANS HOUSE HE
CAME RUNNING OUT TO MEET US WITH A FACE OF HORROR
OH SUCH A BUSINESS HE CRIED WITH HIS HANDS TO HIS TEMPLES
WHAT THEN
BLESSINGTON HAS COMMITTED SUICIDE
HOLMES WHISTLED
YES HE HANGED HIMSELF DURING THE NIGHT
WE HAD ENTERED AND THE DOCTOR HAD PRECEDED US INTO WHAT WAS
EVIDENTLY HIS WAITINGROOM
I REALLY HARDLY KNOW WHAT I AM DOING HE CRIED THE POLICE ARE
ALREADY UPSTAIRS IT HAS SHAKEN ME MOST DREADFULLY
WHEN DID YOU FIND IT OUT
HE HAS A CUP OF TEA TAKEN IN TO HIM EARLY EVERY MORNING WHEN THE
MAID ENTERED ABOUT SEVEN THERE THE UNFORTUNATE FELLOW WAS HANGING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM HE HAD TIED HIS CORD TO THE HOOK ON WHICH
THE HEAVY LAMP USED TO HANG AND HE HAD JUMPED OFF FROM THE TOP OF
THE VERY BOX THAT HE SHOWED US YESTERDAY
HOLMES STOOD FOR A MOMENT IN DEEP THOUGHT
WITH YOUR PERMISSION SAID HE AT LAST I SHOULD LIKE TO GO
UPSTAIRS AND LOOK INTO THE MATTER
WE BOTH ASCENDED FOLLOWED BY THE DOCTOR
IT WAS A DREADFUL SIGHT WHICH MET US AS WE ENTERED THE BEDROOM DOOR
I HAVE SPOKEN OF THE IMPRESSION OF FLABBINESS WHICH THIS MAN
BLESSINGTON CONVEYED AS HE DANGLED FROM THE HOOK IT WAS EXAGGERATED
AND INTENSIFIED UNTIL HE WAS SCARCE HUMAN IN HIS APPEARANCE THE NECK
WAS DRAWN OUT LIKE A PLUCKED CHICKENS MAKING THE REST OF HIM SEEM
THE MORE OBESE AND UNNATURAL BY THE CONTRAST HE WAS CLAD ONLY IN HIS
LONG NIGHTDRESS AND HIS SWOLLEN ANKLES AND UNGAINLY FEET PROTRUDED
STARKLY FROM BENEATH IT BESIDE HIM STOOD A SMARTLOOKING
POLICEINSPECTOR WHO WAS TAKING NOTES IN A POCKETBOOK
AH MR HOLMES SAID HE HEARTILY AS MY FRIEND ENTERED I AM
DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU
GOODMORNING LANNER ANSWERED HOLMES YOU WONT THINK ME AN
INTRUDER I AM SURE HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE EVENTS WHICH LED UP TO
THIS AFFAIR
YES I HEARD SOMETHING OF THEM
HAVE YOU FORMED ANY OPINION
AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THE MAN HAS BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF HIS SENSES BY
FRIGHT THE BED HAS BEEN WELL SLEPT IN YOU SEE THERES HIS
IMPRESSION DEEP ENOUGH ITS ABOUT FIVE IN THE MORNING YOU KNOW
THAT SUICIDES ARE MOST COMMON THAT WOULD BE ABOUT HIS TIME FOR
HANGING HIMSELF IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A VERY DELIBERATE AFFAIR
I SHOULD SAY THAT HE HAS BEEN DEAD ABOUT THREE HOURS JUDGING BY THE
RIGIDITY OF THE MUSCLES SAID I
NOTICED ANYTHING PECULIAR ABOUT THE ROOM ASKED HOLMES
FOUND A SCREWDRIVER AND SOME SCREWS ON THE WASHHAND STAND SEEMS
TO HAVE SMOKED HEAVILY DURING THE NIGHT TOO HERE ARE FOUR
CIGARENDS THAT I PICKED OUT OF THE FIREPLACE
HUM SAID HOLMES HAVE YOU GOT HIS CIGARHOLDER
NO I HAVE SEEN NONE
HIS CIGARCASE THEN
YES IT WAS IN HIS COATPOCKET
HOLMES OPENED IT AND SMELLED THE SINGLE CIGAR WHICH IT CONTAINED
OH THIS IS AN HAVANA AND THESE OTHERS ARE CIGARS OF THE PECULIAR
SORT WHICH ARE IMPORTED BY THE DUTCH FROM THEIR EAST INDIAN COLONIES
THEY ARE USUALLY WRAPPED IN STRAW YOU KNOW AND ARE THINNER FOR
THEIR LENGTH THAN ANY OTHER BRAND HE PICKED UP THE FOUR ENDS AND
EXAMINED THEM WITH HIS POCKETLENS
TWO OF THESE HAVE BEEN SMOKED FROM A HOLDER AND TWO WITHOUT SAID
HE TWO HAVE BEEN CUT BY A NOT VERY SHARP KNIFE AND TWO HAVE HAD
THE ENDS BITTEN OFF BY A SET OF EXCELLENT TEETH THIS IS NO SUICIDE
MR LANNER IT IS A VERY DEEPLY PLANNED AND COLDBLOODED MURDER
IMPOSSIBLE CRIED THE INSPECTOR
AND WHY
WHY SHOULD ANY ONE MURDER A MAN IN SO CLUMSY A FASHION AS BY HANGING
HIM
THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
HOW COULD THEY GET IN
THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR
IT WAS BARRED IN THE MORNING
THEN IT WAS BARRED AFTER THEM
HOW DO YOU KNOW
I SAW THEIR TRACES EXCUSE ME A MOMENT AND I MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE
YOU SOME FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT IT
HE WENT OVER TO THE DOOR AND TURNING THE LOCK HE EXAMINED IT IN HIS
METHODICAL WAY THEN HE TOOK OUT THE KEY WHICH WAS ON THE INSIDE
AND INSPECTED THAT ALSO THE BED THE CARPET THE CHAIRS THE
MANTELPIECE THE DEAD BODY AND THE ROPE WERE EACH IN TURN EXAMINED
UNTIL AT LAST HE PROFESSED HIMSELF SATISFIED AND WITH MY AID AND
THAT OF THE INSPECTOR CUT DOWN THE WRETCHED OBJECT AND LAID IT
REVERENTLY UNDER A SHEET
HOW ABOUT THIS ROPE HE ASKED
IT IS CUT OFF THIS SAID DR TREVELYAN DRAWING A LARGE COIL FROM
UNDER THE BED HE WAS MORBIDLY NERVOUS OF FIRE AND ALWAYS KEPT THIS
BESIDE HIM SO THAT HE MIGHT ESCAPE BY THE WINDOW IN CASE THE STAIRS
WERE BURNING
THAT MUST HAVE SAVED THEM TROUBLE SAID HOLMES THOUGHTFULLY YES
THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE VERY PLAIN AND I SHALL BE SURPRISED IF BY THE
AFTERNOON I CANNOT GIVE YOU THE REASONS FOR THEM AS WELL I WILL TAKE
THIS PHOTOGRAPH OF BLESSINGTON WHICH I SEE UPON THE MANTELPIECE AS
IT MAY HELP ME IN MY INQUIRIES
BUT YOU HAVE TOLD US NOTHING CRIED THE DOCTOR
OH THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS SAID
HOLMES THERE WERE THREE OF THEM IN IT THE YOUNG MAN THE OLD MAN
AND A THIRD TO WHOSE IDENTITY I HAVE NO CLUE THE FIRST TWO I NEED
HARDLY REMARK ARE THE SAME WHO MASQUERADED AS THE RUSSIAN COUNT AND
HIS SON SO WE CAN GIVE A VERY FULL DESCRIPTION OF THEM THEY WERE
ADMITTED BY A CONFEDERATE INSIDE THE HOUSE IF I MIGHT OFFER YOU A
WORD OF ADVICE INSPECTOR IT WOULD BE TO ARREST THE PAGE WHO AS I
UNDERSTAND HAS ONLY RECENTLY COME INTO YOUR SERVICE DOCTOR
THE YOUNG IMP CANNOT BE FOUND SAID DR TREVELYAN THE MAID AND
THE COOK HAVE JUST BEEN SEARCHING FOR HIM
HOLMES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
HE HAS PLAYED A NOT UNIMPORTANT PART IN THIS DRAMA SAID HE THE
THREE MEN HAVING ASCENDED THE STAIRS WHICH THEY DID ON TIPTOE THE
ELDER MAN FIRST THE YOUNGER MAN SECOND AND THE UNKNOWN MAN IN THE
REAR
MY DEAR HOLMES I EJACULATED
OH THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION AS TO THE SUPERIMPOSING OF THE
FOOTMARKS I HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF LEARNING WHICH WAS WHICH LAST
NIGHT THEY ASCENDED THEN TO MR BLESSINGTONS ROOM THE DOOR OF
WHICH THEY FOUND TO BE LOCKED WITH THE HELP OF A WIRE HOWEVER THEY
FORCED ROUND THE KEY EVEN WITHOUT THE LENS YOU WILL PERCEIVE BY THE
SCRATCHES ON THIS WARD WHERE THE PRESSURE WAS APPLIED
ON ENTERING THE ROOM THEIR FIRST PROCEEDING MUST HAVE BEEN TO GAG
MR BLESSINGTON HE MAY HAVE BEEN ASLEEP OR HE MAY HAVE BEEN SO
PARALYZED WITH TERROR AS TO HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CRY OUT THESE WALLS
ARE THICK AND IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT HIS SHRIEK IF HE HAD TIME TO
UTTER ONE WAS UNHEARD
HAVING SECURED HIM IT IS EVIDENT TO ME THAT A CONSULTATION OF SOME
SORT WAS HELD PROBABLY IT WAS SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF A JUDICIAL
PROCEEDING IT MUST HAVE LASTED FOR SOME TIME FOR IT WAS THEN THAT
THESE CIGARS WERE SMOKED THE OLDER MAN SAT IN THAT WICKER CHAIR IT
WAS HE WHO USED THE CIGARHOLDER THE YOUNGER MAN SAT OVER YONDER HE
KNOCKED HIS ASH OFF AGAINST THE CHEST OF DRAWERS THE THIRD FELLOW
PACED UP AND DOWN BLESSINGTON I THINK SAT UPRIGHT IN THE BED BUT
OF THAT I CANNOT BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
WELL IT ENDED BY THEIR TAKING BLESSINGTON AND HANGING HIM THE
MATTER WAS SO PREARRANGED THAT IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THEY BROUGHT WITH
THEM SOME SORT OF BLOCK OR PULLEY WHICH MIGHT SERVE AS A GALLOWS
THAT SCREWDRIVER AND THOSE SCREWS WERE AS I CONCEIVE FOR FIXING IT
UP SEEING THE HOOK HOWEVER THEY NATURALLY SAVED THEMSELVES THE
TROUBLE HAVING FINISHED THEIR WORK THEY MADE OFF AND THE DOOR WAS
BARRED BEHIND THEM BY THEIR CONFEDERATE
WE HAD ALL LISTENED WITH THE DEEPEST INTEREST TO THIS SKETCH OF THE
NIGHTS DOINGS WHICH HOLMES HAD DEDUCED FROM SIGNS SO SUBTLE AND
MINUTE THAT EVEN WHEN HE HAD POINTED THEM OUT TO US WE COULD
SCARCELY FOLLOW HIM IN HIS REASONING THE INSPECTOR HURRIED AWAY ON
THE INSTANT TO MAKE INQUIRIES ABOUT THE PAGE WHILE HOLMES AND I
RETURNED TO BAKER STREET FOR BREAKFAST
ILL BE BACK BY THREE SAID HE WHEN WE HAD FINISHED OUR MEAL
BOTH THE INSPECTOR AND THE DOCTOR WILL MEET ME HERE AT THAT HOUR
AND I HOPE BY THAT TIME TO HAVE CLEARED UP ANY LITTLE OBSCURITY WHICH
THE CASE MAY STILL PRESENT
OUR VISITORS ARRIVED AT THE APPOINTED TIME BUT IT WAS A QUARTER TO
FOUR BEFORE MY FRIEND PUT IN AN APPEARANCE FROM HIS EXPRESSION AS HE
ENTERED HOWEVER I COULD SEE THAT ALL HAD GONE WELL WITH HIM
ANY NEWS INSPECTOR
WE HAVE GOT THE BOY SIR
EXCELLENT AND I HAVE GOT THE MEN
YOU HAVE GOT THEM WE CRIED ALL THREE
WELL AT LEAST I HAVE GOT THEIR IDENTITY THIS SOCALLED BLESSINGTON
IS AS I EXPECTED WELL KNOWN AT HEADQUARTERS AND SO ARE HIS
ASSAILANTS THEIR NAMES ARE BIDDLE HAYWARD AND MOFFAT
THE WORTHINGDON BANK GANG CRIED THE INSPECTOR
PRECISELY SAID HOLMES
THEN BLESSINGTON MUST HAVE BEEN SUTTON
EXACTLY SAID HOLMES
WHY THAT MAKES IT AS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL SAID THE INSPECTOR
BUT TREVELYAN AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN BEWILDERMENT
YOU MUST SURELY REMEMBER THE GREAT WORTHINGDON BANK BUSINESS SAID
HOLMES FIVE MEN WERE IN ITTHESE FOUR AND A FIFTH CALLED
CARTWRIGHT TOBIN THE CARETAKER WAS MURDERED AND THE THIEVES GOT
AWAY WITH SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS THIS WAS IN THEY WERE ALL FIVE
ARRESTED BUT THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM WAS BY NO MEANS CONCLUSIVE
THIS BLESSINGTON OR SUTTON WHO WAS THE WORST OF THE GANG TURNED
INFORMER ON HIS EVIDENCE CARTWRIGHT WAS HANGED AND THE OTHER THREE
GOT FIFTEEN YEARS APIECE WHEN THEY GOT OUT THE OTHER DAY WHICH WAS
SOME YEARS BEFORE THEIR FULL TERM THEY SET THEMSELVES AS YOU
PERCEIVE TO HUNT DOWN THE TRAITOR AND TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THEIR
COMRADE UPON HIM TWICE THEY TRIED TO GET AT HIM AND FAILED A THIRD
TIME YOU SEE IT CAME OFF IS THERE ANYTHING FURTHER WHICH I CAN
EXPLAIN DR TREVELYAN
I THINK YOU HAVE MADE IT ALL REMARKABLE CLEAR SAID THE DOCTOR NO
DOUBT THE DAY ON WHICH HE WAS PERTURBED WAS THE DAY WHEN HE HAD SEEN
OF THEIR RELEASE IN THE NEWSPAPERS
QUITE SO HIS TALK ABOUT A BURGLARY WAS THE MEREST BLIND
BUT WHY COULD HE NOT TELL YOU THIS
WELL MY DEAR SIR KNOWING THE VINDICTIVE CHARACTER OF HIS OLD
ASSOCIATES HE WAS TRYING TO HIDE HIS OWN IDENTITY FROM EVERYBODY AS
LONG AS HE COULD HIS SECRET WAS A SHAMEFUL ONE AND HE COULD NOT
BRING HIMSELF TO DIVULGE IT HOWEVER WRETCH AS HE WAS HE WAS STILL
LIVING UNDER THE SHIELD OF BRITISH LAW AND I HAVE NO DOUBT
INSPECTOR THAT YOU WILL SEE THAT THOUGH THAT SHIELD MAY FAIL TO
GUARD THE SWORD OF JUSTICE IS STILL THERE TO AVENGE
SUCH WERE THE SINGULAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESIDENT
PATIENT AND THE BROOK STREET DOCTOR FROM THAT NIGHT NOTHING HAS BEEN
SEEN OF THE THREE MURDERERS BY THE POLICE AND IT IS SURMISED AT
SCOTLAND YARD THAT THEY WERE AMONG THE PASSENGERS OF THE ILLFATED
STEAMER NORAH CREINA WHICH WAS LOST SOME YEARS AGO WITH ALL HANDS
UPON THE PORTUGUESE COAST SOME LEAGUES TO THE NORTH OF OPORTO THE
PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE PAGE BROKE DOWN FOR WANT OF EVIDENCE AND THE
BROOK STREET MYSTERY AS IT WAS CALLED HAS NEVER UNTIL NOW BEEN
FULLY DEALT WITH IN ANY PUBLIC PRINT
THE GREEK INTERPRETER
DURING MY LONG AND INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH MR SHERLOCK HOLMES I
HAD NEVER HEARD HIM REFER TO HIS RELATIONS AND HARDLY EVER TO HIS
OWN EARLY LIFE THIS RETICENCE UPON HIS PART HAD INCREASED THE
SOMEWHAT INHUMAN EFFECT WHICH HE PRODUCED UPON ME UNTIL SOMETIMES I
FOUND MYSELF REGARDING HIM AS AN ISOLATED PHENOMENON A BRAIN WITHOUT
A HEART AS DEFICIENT IN HUMAN SYMPATHY AS HE WAS PREEMINENT IN
INTELLIGENCE HIS AVERSION TO WOMEN AND HIS DISINCLINATION TO FORM
NEW FRIENDSHIPS WERE BOTH TYPICAL OF HIS UNEMOTIONAL CHARACTER BUT
NOT MORE SO THAN HIS COMPLETE SUPPRESSION OF EVERY REFERENCE TO HIS
OWN PEOPLE I HAD COME TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS AN ORPHAN WITH NO
RELATIVES LIVING BUT ONE DAY TO MY VERY GREAT SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO
TALK TO ME ABOUT HIS BROTHER
IT WAS AFTER TEA ON A SUMMER EVENING AND THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD
ROAMED IN A DESULTORY SPASMODIC FASHION FROM GOLF CLUBS TO THE
CAUSES OF THE CHANGE IN THE OBLIQUITY OF THE ECLIPTIC CAME ROUND AT
LAST TO THE QUESTION OF ATAVISM AND HEREDITARY APTITUDES THE POINT
UNDER DISCUSSION WAS HOW FAR ANY SINGULAR GIFT IN AN INDIVIDUAL WAS
DUE TO HIS ANCESTRY AND HOW FAR TO HIS OWN EARLY TRAINING
IN YOUR OWN CASE SAID I FROM ALL THAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME IT SEEMS
OBVIOUS THAT YOUR FACULTY OF OBSERVATION AND YOUR PECULIAR FACILITY
FOR DEDUCTION ARE DUE TO YOUR OWN SYSTEMATIC TRAINING
TO SOME EXTENT HE ANSWERED THOUGHTFULLY MY ANCESTORS WERE
COUNTRY SQUIRES WHO APPEAR TO HAVE LED MUCH THE SAME LIFE AS IS
NATURAL TO THEIR CLASS BUT NONE THE LESS MY TURN THAT WAY IS IN
MY VEINS AND MAY HAVE COME WITH MY GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS THE SISTER
OF VERNET THE FRENCH ARTIST ART IN THE BLOOD IS LIABLE TO TAKE THE
STRANGEST FORMS
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT IT IS HEREDITARY
BECAUSE MY BROTHER MYCROFT POSSESSES IT IN A LARGER DEGREE THAN I
DO
THIS WAS NEWS TO ME INDEED IF THERE WERE ANOTHER MAN WITH SUCH
SINGULAR POWERS IN ENGLAND HOW WAS IT THAT NEITHER POLICE NOR PUBLIC
HAD HEARD OF HIM I PUT THE QUESTION WITH A HINT THAT IT WAS MY
COMPANIONS MODESTY WHICH MADE HIM ACKNOWLEDGE HIS BROTHER AS HIS
SUPERIOR HOLMES LAUGHED AT MY SUGGESTION
MY DEAR WATSON SAID HE I CANNOT AGREE WITH THOSE WHO RANK
MODESTY AMONG THE VIRTUES TO THE LOGICIAN ALL THINGS SHOULD BE SEEN
EXACTLY AS THEY ARE AND TO UNDERESTIMATE ONES SELF IS AS MUCH A
DEPARTURE FROM TRUTH AS TO EXAGGERATE ONES OWN POWERS WHEN I SAY
THEREFORE THAT MYCROFT HAS BETTER POWERS OF OBSERVATION THAN I YOU
MAY TAKE IT THAT I AM SPEAKING THE EXACT AND LITERAL TRUTH
IS HE YOUR JUNIOR
SEVEN YEARS MY SENIOR
HOW COMES IT THAT HE IS UNKNOWN
OH HE IS VERY WELL KNOWN IN HIS OWN CIRCLE
WHERE THEN
WELL IN THE DIOGENES CLUB FOR EXAMPLE
I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE INSTITUTION AND MY FACE MUST HAVE
PROCLAIMED AS MUCH FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES PULLED OUT HIS WATCH
THE DIOGENES CLUB IS THE QUEEREST CLUB IN LONDON AND MYCROFT ONE OF
THE QUEEREST MEN HES ALWAYS THERE FROM QUARTER TO FIVE TO TWENTY
TO EIGHT ITS SIX NOW SO IF YOU CARE FOR A STROLL THIS BEAUTIFUL
EVENING I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY TO INTRODUCE YOU TO TWO CURIOSITIES
FIVE MINUTES LATER WE WERE IN THE STREET WALKING TOWARDS REGENTS
CIRCUS
YOU WONDER SAID MY COMPANION WHY IT IS THAT MYCROFT DOES NOT USE
HIS POWERS FOR DETECTIVE WORK HE IS INCAPABLE OF IT
BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID
I SAID THAT HE WAS MY SUPERIOR IN OBSERVATION AND DEDUCTION IF THE
ART OF THE DETECTIVE BEGAN AND ENDED IN REASONING FROM AN ARMCHAIR
MY BROTHER WOULD BE THE GREATEST CRIMINAL AGENT THAT EVER LIVED BUT
HE HAS NO AMBITION AND NO ENERGY HE WILL NOT EVEN GO OUT OF HIS WAY
TO VERIFY HIS OWN SOLUTION AND WOULD RATHER BE CONSIDERED WRONG THAN
TAKE THE TROUBLE TO PROVE HIMSELF RIGHT AGAIN AND AGAIN I HAVE
TAKEN A PROBLEM TO HIM AND HAVE RECEIVED AN EXPLANATION WHICH HAS
AFTERWARDS PROVED TO BE THE CORRECT ONE AND YET HE WAS ABSOLUTELY
INCAPABLE OF WORKING OUT THE PRACTICAL POINTS WHICH MUST BE GONE INTO
BEFORE A CASE COULD BE LAID BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY
IT IS NOT HIS PROFESSION THEN
BY NO MEANS WHAT IS TO ME A MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD IS TO HIM THE
MEREST HOBBY OF A DILETTANTE HE HAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FACULTY FOR
FIGURES AND AUDITS THE BOOKS IN SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
MYCROFT LODGES IN PALL MALL AND HE WALKS ROUND THE CORNER INTO
WHITEHALL EVERY MORNING AND BACK EVERY EVENING FROM YEARS END TO
YEARS END HE TAKES NO OTHER EXERCISE AND IS SEEN NOWHERE ELSE
EXCEPT ONLY IN THE DIOGENES CLUB WHICH IS JUST OPPOSITE HIS ROOMS
I CANNOT RECALL THE NAME
VERY LIKELY NOT THERE ARE MANY MEN IN LONDON YOU KNOW WHO SOME
FROM SHYNESS SOME FROM MISANTHROPY HAVE NO WISH FOR THE COMPANY OF
THEIR FELLOWS YET THEY ARE NOT AVERSE TO COMFORTABLE CHAIRS AND THE
LATEST PERIODICALS IT IS FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THESE THAT THE
DIOGENES CLUB WAS STARTED AND IT NOW CONTAINS THE MOST UNSOCIABLE
AND UNCLUBABLE MEN IN TOWN NO MEMBER IS PERMITTED TO TAKE THE LEAST
NOTICE OF ANY OTHER ONE SAVE IN THE STRANGERS ROOM NO TALKING IS
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOWED AND THREE OFFENCES IF BROUGHT TO
THE NOTICE OF THE COMMITTEE RENDER THE TALKER LIABLE TO EXPULSION MY
BROTHER WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS AND I HAVE MYSELF FOUND IT A VERY
SOOTHING ATMOSPHERE
WE HAD REACHED PALL MALL AS WE TALKED AND WERE WALKING DOWN IT FROM
THE ST JAMESS END SHERLOCK HOLMES STOPPED AT A DOOR SOME LITTLE
DISTANCE FROM THE CARLTON AND CAUTIONING ME NOT TO SPEAK HE LED
THE WAY INTO THE HALL THROUGH THE GLASS PANELING I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE
OF A LARGE AND LUXURIOUS ROOM IN WHICH A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF MEN
WERE SITTING ABOUT AND READING PAPERS EACH IN HIS OWN LITTLE NOOK
HOLMES SHOWED ME INTO A SMALL CHAMBER WHICH LOOKED OUT INTO PALL
MALL AND THEN LEAVING ME FOR A MINUTE HE CAME BACK WITH A
COMPANION WHOM I KNEW COULD ONLY BE HIS BROTHER
MYCROFT HOLMES WAS A MUCH LARGER AND STOUTER MAN THAN SHERLOCK HIS
BODY WAS ABSOLUTELY CORPULENT BUT HIS FACE THOUGH MASSIVE HAD
PRESERVED SOMETHING OF THE SHARPNESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH WAS SO
REMARKABLE IN THAT OF HIS BROTHER HIS EYES WHICH WERE OF A
PECULIARLY LIGHT WATERY GRAY SEEMED TO ALWAYS RETAIN THAT FARAWAY
INTROSPECTIVE LOOK WHICH I HAD ONLY OBSERVED IN SHERLOCKS WHEN HE
WAS EXERTING HIS FULL POWERS
I AM GLAD TO MEET YOU SIR SAID HE PUTTING OUT A BROAD FAT HAND
LIKE THE FLIPPER OF A SEAL I HEAR OF SHERLOCK EVERYWHERE SINCE YOU
BECAME HIS CHRONICLER BY THE WAY SHERLOCK I EXPECTED TO SEE YOU
ROUND LAST WEEK TO CONSULT ME OVER THAT MANOR HOUSE CASE I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE OUT OF YOUR DEPTH
NO I SOLVED IT SAID MY FRIEND SMILING
IT WAS ADAMS OF COURSE
YES IT WAS ADAMS
I WAS SURE OF IT FROM THE FIRST THE TWO SAT DOWN TOGETHER IN THE
BOWWINDOW OF THE CLUB TO ANY ONE WHO WISHES TO STUDY MANKIND THIS
IS THE SPOT SAID MYCROFT LOOK AT THE MAGNIFICENT TYPES LOOK AT
THESE TWO MEN WHO ARE COMING TOWARDS US FOR EXAMPLE
THE BILLIARDMARKER AND THE OTHER
PRECISELY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE OTHER
THE TWO MEN HAD STOPPED OPPOSITE THE WINDOW SOME CHALK MARKS OVER
THE WAISTCOAT POCKET WERE THE ONLY SIGNS OF BILLIARDS WHICH I COULD
SEE IN ONE OF THEM THE OTHER WAS A VERY SMALL DARK FELLOW WITH
HIS HAT PUSHED BACK AND SEVERAL PACKAGES UNDER HIS ARM
AN OLD SOLDIER I PERCEIVE SAID SHERLOCK
AND VERY RECENTLY DISCHARGED REMARKED THE BROTHER
SERVED IN INDIA I SEE
AND A NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER
ROYAL ARTILLERY I FANCY SAID SHERLOCK
AND A WIDOWER
BUT WITH A CHILD
CHILDREN MY DEAR BOY CHILDREN
COME SAID I LAUGHING THIS IS A LITTLE TOO MUCH
SURELY ANSWERED HOLMES IT IS NOT HARD TO SAY THAT A MAN WITH
THAT BEARING EXPRESSION OF AUTHORITY AND SUNBAKED SKIN IS A
SOLDIER IS MORE THAN A PRIVATE AND IS NOT LONG FROM INDIA
THAT HE HAS NOT LEFT THE SERVICE LONG IS SHOWN BY HIS STILL WEARING
HIS AMMUNITION BOOTS AS THEY ARE CALLED OBSERVED MYCROFT
HE HAD NOT THE CAVALRY STRIDE YET HE WORE HIS HAT ON ONE SIDE AS
IS SHOWN BY THE LIGHTER SKIN OF THAT SIDE OF HIS BROW HIS WEIGHT IS
AGAINST HIS BEING A SAPPER HE IS IN THE ARTILLERY
THEN OF COURSE HIS COMPLETE MOURNING SHOWS THAT HE HAS LOST SOME
ONE VERY DEAR THE FACT THAT HE IS DOING HIS OWN SHOPPING LOOKS AS
THOUGH IT WERE HIS WIFE HE HAS BEEN BUYING THINGS FOR CHILDREN YOU
PERCEIVE THERE IS A RATTLE WHICH SHOWS THAT ONE OF THEM IS VERY
YOUNG THE WIFE PROBABLY DIED IN CHILDBED THE FACT THAT HE HAS A
PICTUREBOOK UNDER HIS ARM SHOWS THAT THERE IS ANOTHER CHILD TO BE
THOUGHT OF
I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MY FRIEND MEANT WHEN HE SAID THAT HIS
BROTHER POSSESSED EVEN KEENER FACULTIES THAT HE DID HIMSELF HE
GLANCED ACROSS AT ME AND SMILED MYCROFT TOOK SNUFF FROM A
TORTOISESHELL BOX AND BRUSHED AWAY THE WANDERING GRAINS FROM HIS
COAT FRONT WITH A LARGE RED SILK HANDKERCHIEF
BY THE WAY SHERLOCK SAID HE I HAVE HAD SOMETHING QUITE AFTER
YOUR OWN HEARTA MOST SINGULAR PROBLEMSUBMITTED TO MY JUDGMENT I
REALLY HAD NOT THE ENERGY TO FOLLOW IT UP SAVE IN A VERY INCOMPLETE
FASHION BUT IT GAVE ME A BASIS FOR SOME PLEASING SPECULATION IF
YOU WOULD CARE TO HEAR THE FACTS
MY DEAR MYCROFT I SHOULD BE DELIGHTED
THE BROTHER SCRIBBLED A NOTE UPON A LEAF OF HIS POCKETBOOK AND
RINGING THE BELL HE HANDED IT TO THE WAITER
I HAVE ASKED MR MELAS TO STEP ACROSS SAID HE HE LODGES ON THE
FLOOR ABOVE ME AND I HAVE SOME SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM WHICH
LED HIM TO COME TO ME IN HIS PERPLEXITY MR MELAS IS A GREEK BY
EXTRACTION AS I UNDERSTAND AND HE IS A REMARKABLE LINGUIST HE
EARNS HIS LIVING PARTLY AS INTERPRETER IN THE LAW COURTS AND PARTLY
BY ACTING AS GUIDE TO ANY WEALTHY ORIENTALS WHO MAY VISIT THE
NORTHUMBERLAND AVENUE HOTELS I THINK I WILL LEAVE HIM TO TELL HIS
VERY REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE IN HIS OWN FASHION
A FEW MINUTES LATER WE WERE JOINED BY A SHORT STOUT MAN WHOSE OLIVE
FACE AND COALBLACK HAIR PROCLAIMED HIS SOUTHERN ORIGIN THOUGH HIS
SPEECH WAS THAT OF AN EDUCATED ENGLISHMAN HE SHOOK HANDS EAGERLY
WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES AND HIS DARK EYES SPARKLED WITH PLEASURE WHEN
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SPECIALIST WAS ANXIOUS TO HEAR HIS STORY
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE POLICE CREDIT MEON MY WORD I DO NOT
SAID HE IN A WAILING VOICE JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF
IT BEFORE THEY THINK THAT SUCH A THING CANNOT BE BUT I KNOW THAT I
SHALL NEVER BE EASY IN MY MIND UNTIL I KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF MY
POOR MAN WITH THE STICKINGPLASTER UPON HIS FACE
I AM ALL ATTENTION SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
THIS IS WEDNESDAY EVENING SAID MR MELAS WELL THEN IT WAS
MONDAY NIGHTONLY TWO DAYS AGO YOU UNDERSTANDTHAT ALL THIS
HAPPENED I AM AN INTERPRETER AS PERHAPS MY NEIGHBOR THERE HAS TOLD
YOU I INTERPRET ALL LANGUAGESOR NEARLY ALLBUT AS I AM A GREEK
BY BIRTH AND WITH A GRECIAN NAME IT IS WITH THAT PARTICULAR TONGUE
THAT I AM PRINCIPALLY ASSOCIATED FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE BEEN THE
CHIEF GREEK INTERPRETER IN LONDON AND MY NAME IS VERY WELL KNOWN IN
THE HOTELS
IT HAPPENS NOT UNFREQUENTLY THAT I AM SENT FOR AT STRANGE HOURS BY
FOREIGNERS WHO GET INTO DIFFICULTIES OR BY TRAVELERS WHO ARRIVE LATE
AND WISH MY SERVICES I WAS NOT SURPRISED THEREFORE ON MONDAY
NIGHT WHEN A MR LATIMER A VERY FASHIONABLY DRESSED YOUNG MAN CAME
UP TO MY ROOMS AND ASKED ME TO ACCOMPANY HIM IN A CAB WHICH WAS
WAITING AT THE DOOR A GREEK FRIEND HAD COME TO SEE HIM UPON
BUSINESS HE SAID AND AS HE COULD SPEAK NOTHING BUT HIS OWN TONGUE
THE SERVICES OF AN INTERPRETER WERE INDISPENSABLE HE GAVE ME TO
UNDERSTAND THAT HIS HOUSE WAS SOME LITTLE DISTANCE OFF IN
KENSINGTON AND HE SEEMED TO BE IN A GREAT HURRY BUSTLING ME RAPIDLY
INTO THE CAB WHEN WE HAD DESCENDED TO THE STREET
I SAY INTO THE CAB BUT I SOON BECAME DOUBTFUL AS TO WHETHER IT WAS
NOT A CARRIAGE IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF IT WAS CERTAINLY MORE ROOMY
THAN THE ORDINARY FOURWHEELED DISGRACE TO LONDON AND THE FITTINGS
THOUGH FRAYED WERE OF RICH QUALITY MR LATIMER SEATED HIMSELF
OPPOSITE TO ME AND WE STARTED OFF THROUGH CHARING CROSS AND UP THE
SHAFTESBURY AVENUE WE HAD COME OUT UPON OXFORD STREET AND I HAD
VENTURED SOME REMARK AS TO THIS BEING A ROUNDABOUT WAY TO KENSINGTON
WHEN MY WORDS WERE ARRESTED BY THE EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT OF MY
COMPANION
HE BEGAN BY DRAWING A MOST FORMIDABLELOOKING BLUDGEON LOADED WITH
LEAD FROM HIS POCKET AND SWITCHING IT BACKWARD AND FORWARD SEVERAL
TIMES AS IF TO TEST ITS WEIGHT AND STRENGTH THEN HE PLACED IT
WITHOUT A WORD UPON THE SEAT BESIDE HIM HAVING DONE THIS HE DREW
UP THE WINDOWS ON EACH SIDE AND I FOUND TO MY ASTONISHMENT THAT THEY
WERE COVERED WITH PAPER SO AS TO PREVENT MY SEEING THROUGH THEM
I AM SORRY TO CUT OFF YOUR VIEW MR MELAS SAID HE THE FACT IS
THAT I HAVE NO INTENTION THAT YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT THE PLACE IS TO
WHICH WE ARE DRIVING IT MIGHT POSSIBLY BE INCONVENIENT TO ME IF YOU
COULD FIND YOUR WAY THERE AGAIN
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE I WAS UTTERLY TAKEN ABACK BY SUCH AN ADDRESS MY
COMPANION WAS A POWERFUL BROADSHOULDERED YOUNG FELLOW AND
APART FROM THE WEAPON I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE IN
A STRUGGLE WITH HIM
THIS IS VERY EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MR LATIMER I STAMMERED YOU MUST BE
AWARE THAT WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS QUITE ILLEGAL
IT IS SOMEWHAT OF A LIBERTY NO DOUBT SAID HE BUT WELL MAKE IT
UP TO YOU I MUST WARN YOU HOWEVER MR MELAS THAT IF AT ANY TIME
TONIGHT YOU ATTEMPT TO RAISE AN ALARM OR DO ANYTHING WHICH IS
AGAINST MY INTERESTS YOU WILL FIND IT A VERY SERIOUS THING I BEG
YOU TO REMEMBER THAT NO ONE KNOWS WHERE YOU ARE AND THAT WHETHER
YOU ARE IN THIS CARRIAGE OR IN MY HOUSE YOU ARE EQUALLY IN MY
POWER
HIS WORDS WERE QUIET BUT HE HAD A RASPING WAY OF SAYING THEM WHICH
WAS VERY MENACING I SAT IN SILENCE WONDERING WHAT ON EARTH COULD BE
HIS REASON FOR KIDNAPPING ME IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY FASHION WHATEVER
IT MIGHT BE IT WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE USE IN
MY RESISTING AND THAT I COULD ONLY WAIT TO SEE WHAT MIGHT BEFALL
FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS WE DROVE WITHOUT MY HAVING THE LEAST CLUE AS TO
WHERE WE WERE GOING SOMETIMES THE RATTLE OF THE STONES TOLD OF A
PAVED CAUSEWAY AND AT OTHERS OUR SMOOTH SILENT COURSE SUGGESTED
ASPHALT BUT SAVE BY THIS VARIATION IN SOUND THERE WAS NOTHING AT
ALL WHICH COULD IN THE REMOTEST WAY HELP ME TO FORM A GUESS AS TO
WHERE WE WERE THE PAPER OVER EACH WINDOW WAS IMPENETRABLE TO LIGHT
AND A BLUE CURTAIN WAS DRAWN ACROSS THE GLASS WORK IN FRONT IT WAS
A QUARTERPAST SEVEN WHEN WE LEFT PALL MALL AND MY WATCH SHOWED ME
THAT IT WAS TEN MINUTES TO NINE WHEN WE AT LAST CAME TO A STANDSTILL
MY COMPANION LET DOWN THE WINDOW AND I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A LOW
ARCHED DOORWAY WITH A LAMP BURNING ABOVE IT AS I WAS HURRIED FROM
THE CARRIAGE IT SWUNG OPEN AND I FOUND MYSELF INSIDE THE HOUSE WITH
A VAGUE IMPRESSION OF A LAWN AND TREES ON EACH SIDE OF ME AS I
ENTERED WHETHER THESE WERE PRIVATE GROUNDS HOWEVER OR BONAFIDE
COUNTRY WAS MORE THAN I COULD POSSIBLY VENTURE TO SAY
THERE WAS A COLORED GASLAMP INSIDE WHICH WAS TURNED SO LOW THAT I
COULD SEE LITTLE SAVE THAT THE HALL WAS OF SOME SIZE AND HUNG WITH
PICTURES IN THE DIM LIGHT I COULD MAKE OUT THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD
OPENED THE DOOR WAS A SMALL MEANLOOKING MIDDLEAGED MAN WITH
ROUNDED SHOULDERS AS HE TURNED TOWARDS US THE GLINT OF THE LIGHT
SHOWED ME THAT HE WAS WEARING GLASSES
IS THIS MR MELAS HAROLD SAID HE
YES
WELL DONE WELL DONE NO ILLWILL MR MELAS I HOPE BUT WE COULD
NOT GET ON WITHOUT YOU IF YOU DEAL FAIR WITH US YOULL NOT REGRET
IT BUT IF YOU TRY ANY TRICKS GOD HELP YOU HE SPOKE IN A NERVOUS
JERKY FASHION AND WITH LITTLE GIGGLING LAUGHS IN BETWEEN BUT
SOMEHOW HE IMPRESSED ME WITH FEAR MORE THAN THE OTHER
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME I ASKED
ONLY TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS OF A GREEK GENTLEMAN WHO IS VISITING
US AND TO LET US HAVE THE ANSWERS BUT SAY NO MORE THAN YOU ARE
TOLD TO SAY OR HERE CAME THE NERVOUS GIGGLE AGAINYOU HAD
BETTER NEVER HAVE BEEN BORN
AS HE SPOKE HE OPENED A DOOR AND SHOWED THE WAY INTO A ROOM WHICH
APPEARED TO BE VERY RICHLY FURNISHED BUT AGAIN THE ONLY LIGHT WAS
AFFORDED BY A SINGLE LAMP HALFTURNED DOWN THE CHAMBER WAS
CERTAINLY LARGE AND THE WAY IN WHICH MY FEET SANK INTO THE CARPET AS
I STEPPED ACROSS IT TOLD ME OF ITS RICHNESS I CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF
VELVET CHAIRS A HIGH WHITE MARBLE MANTELPIECE AND WHAT SEEMED TO
BE A SUIT OF JAPANESE ARMOR AT ONE SIDE OF IT THERE WAS A CHAIR
JUST UNDER THE LAMP AND THE ELDERLY MAN MOTIONED THAT I SHOULD SIT
IN IT THE YOUNGER HAD LEFT US BUT HE SUDDENLY RETURNED THROUGH
ANOTHER DOOR LEADING WITH HIM A GENTLEMAN CLAD IN SOME SORT OF LOOSE
DRESSINGGOWN WHO MOVED SLOWLY TOWARDS US AS HE CAME INTO THE
CIRCLE OF DIM LIGHT WHICH ENABLED ME TO SEE HIM MORE CLEARLY I WAS
THRILLED WITH HORROR AT HIS APPEARANCE HE WAS DEADLY PALE AND
TERRIBLY EMACIATED WITH THE PROTRUDING BRILLIANT EYES OF A MAN
WHOSE SPIRIT WAS GREATER THAN HIS STRENGTH BUT WHAT SHOCKED ME MORE
THAN ANY SIGNS OF PHYSICAL WEAKNESS WAS THAT HIS FACE WAS GROTESQUELY
CRISSCROSSED WITH STICKINGPLASTER AND THAT ONE LARGE PAD OF IT WAS
FASTENED OVER HIS MOUTH
HAVE YOU THE SLATE HAROLD CRIED THE OLDER MAN AS THIS STRANGE
BEING FELL RATHER THAN SAT DOWN INTO A CHAIR ARE HIS HANDS LOOSE NOW
THEN GIVE HIM THE PENCIL YOU ARE TO ASK THE QUESTIONS MR
MELAS AND HE WILL WRITE THE ANSWERS ASK HIM FIRST OF ALL WHETHER
HE IS PREPARED TO SIGN THE PAPERS
THE MANS EYES FLASHED FIRE
NEVER HE WROTE IN GREEK UPON THE SLATE
ON NO CONDITION I ASKED AT THE BIDDING OF OUR TYRANT
ONLY IF I SEE HER MARRIED IN MY PRESENCE BY A GREEK PRIEST WHOM I
KNOW
THE MAN GIGGLED IN HIS VENOMOUS WAY
YOU KNOW WHAT AWAITS YOU THEN
I CARE NOTHING FOR MYSELF
THESE ARE SAMPLES OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WHICH MADE UP OUR
STRANGE HALFSPOKEN HALFWRITTEN CONVERSATION AGAIN AND AGAIN I
HAD TO ASK HIM WHETHER HE WOULD GIVE IN AND SIGN THE DOCUMENTS AGAIN
AND AGAIN I HAD THE SAME INDIGNANT REPLY BUT SOON A HAPPY
THOUGHT CAME TO ME I TOOK TO ADDING ON LITTLE SENTENCES OF MY OWN
TO EACH QUESTION INNOCENT ONES AT FIRST TO TEST WHETHER EITHER OF
OUR COMPANIONS KNEW ANYTHING OF THE MATTER AND THEN AS I FOUND THAT
THEY SHOWED NO SIGNS I PLAYED A MORE DANGEROUS GAME OUR
CONVERSATION RAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS
YOU CAN DO NO GOOD BY THIS OBSTINACY WHO ARE YOU
I CARE NOT I AM A STRANGER IN LONDON
YOUR FATE WILL BE UPON YOUR OWN HEAD HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE
LET IT BE SO THREE WEEKS
THE PROPERTY CAN NEVER BE YOURS WHAT AILS YOU
IT SHALL NOT GO TO VILLAINS THEY ARE STARVING ME
YOU SHALL GO FREE IF YOU SIGN WHAT HOUSE IS THIS
I WILL NEVER SIGN I DO NOT KNOW
YOU ARE NOT DOING HER ANY SERVICE WHAT IS YOUR NAME
LET ME HEAR HER SAY SO KRATIDES
YOU SHALL SEE HER IF YOU SIGN WHERE ARE YOU FROM
THEN I SHALL NEVER SEE HER ATHENS
ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES MR HOLMES AND I SHOULD HAVE WORMED OUT THE
WHOLE STORY UNDER THEIR VERY NOSES MY VERY NEXT QUESTION MIGHT HAVE
CLEARED THE MATTER UP BUT AT THAT INSTANT THE DOOR OPENED AND A
WOMAN STEPPED INTO THE ROOM I COULD NOT SEE HER CLEARLY ENOUGH TO
KNOW MORE THAN THAT SHE WAS TALL AND GRACEFUL WITH BLACK HAIR AND
CLAD IN SOME SORT OF LOOSE WHITE GOWN
HAROLD SAID SHE SPEAKING ENGLISH WITH A BROKEN ACCENT I COULD
NOT STAY AWAY LONGER IT IS SO LONELY UP THERE WITH ONLYOH MY
GOD IT IS PAUL
THESE LAST WORDS WERE IN GREEK AND AT THE SAME INSTANT THE MAN WITH
A CONVULSIVE EFFORT TORE THE PLASTER FROM HIS LIPS AND SCREAMING OUT
SOPHY SOPHY RUSHED INTO THE WOMANS ARMS THEIR EMBRACE WAS BUT
FOR AN INSTANT HOWEVER FOR THE YOUNGER MAN SEIZED THE WOMAN AND
PUSHED HER OUT OF THE ROOM WHILE THE ELDER EASILY OVERPOWERED HIS
EMACIATED VICTIM AND DRAGGED HIM AWAY THROUGH THE OTHER DOOR FOR A
MOMENT I WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE ROOM AND I SPRANG TO MY FEET WITH
SOME VAGUE IDEA THAT I MIGHT IN SOME WAY GET A CLUE TO WHAT THIS
HOUSE WAS IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF FORTUNATELY HOWEVER I TOOK NO
STEPS FOR LOOKING UP I SAW THAT THE OLDER MAN WAS STANDING IN THE
DOORWAY WITH HIS EYES FIXED UPON ME
THAT WILL DO MR MELAS SAID HE YOU PERCEIVE THAT WE HAVE
TAKEN YOU INTO OUR CONFIDENCE OVER SOME VERY PRIVATE BUSINESS WE
SHOULD NOT HAVE TROUBLED YOU ONLY THAT OUR FRIEND WHO SPEAKS GREEK
AND WHO BEGAN THESE NEGOTIATIONS HAS BEEN FORCED TO RETURN TO THE
EAST IT WAS QUITE NECESSARY FOR US TO FIND SOME ONE TO TAKE HIS
PLACE AND WE WERE FORTUNATE IN HEARING OF YOUR POWERS
I BOWED
THERE ARE FIVE SOVEREIGNS HERE SAID HE WALKING UP TO ME WHICH
WILL I HOPE BE A SUFFICIENT FEE BUT REMEMBER HE ADDED TAPPING
ME LIGHTLY ON THE CHEST AND GIGGLING IF YOU SPEAK TO A HUMAN SOUL
ABOUT THISONE HUMAN SOUL MINDWELL MAY GOD HAVE MERCY UPON YOUR
SOUL
I CANNOT TELL YOU THE LOATHING AND HORROR WITH WHICH THIS
INSIGNIFICANTLOOKING MAN INSPIRED ME I COULD SEE HIM BETTER NOW AS
THE LAMPLIGHT SHONE UPON HIM HIS FEATURES WERE PEAKY AND SALLOW
AND HIS LITTLE POINTED BEARD WAS THREADY AND ILLNOURISHED HE
PUSHED HIS FACE FORWARD AS HE SPOKE AND HIS LIPS AND EYELIDS WERE
CONTINUALLY TWITCHING LIKE A MAN WITH ST VITUSS DANCE I COULD NOT
HELP THINKING THAT HIS STRANGE CATCHY LITTLE LAUGH WAS ALSO A
SYMPTOM OF SOME NERVOUS MALADY THE TERROR OF HIS FACE LAY IN HIS
EYES HOWEVER STEEL GRAY AND GLISTENING COLDLY WITH A MALIGNANT
INEXORABLE CRUELTY IN THEIR DEPTHS
WE SHALL KNOW IF YOU SPEAK OF THIS SAID HE WE HAVE OUR OWN
MEANS OF INFORMATION NOW YOU WILL FIND THE CARRIAGE WAITING AND MY
FRIEND WILL SEE YOU ON YOUR WAY
I WAS HURRIED THROUGH THE HALL AND INTO THE VEHICLE AGAIN OBTAINING
THAT MOMENTARY GLIMPSE OF TREES AND A GARDEN MR LATIMER FOLLOWED
CLOSELY AT MY HEELS AND TOOK HIS PLACE OPPOSITE TO ME WITHOUT A
WORD IN SILENCE WE AGAIN DROVE FOR AN INTERMINABLE DISTANCE WITH
THE WINDOWS RAISED UNTIL AT LAST JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT THE CARRIAGE
PULLED UP
YOU WILL GET DOWN HERE MR MELAS SAID MY COMPANION I AM SORRY
TO LEAVE YOU SO FAR FROM YOUR HOUSE BUT THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE ANY
ATTEMPT UPON YOUR PART TO FOLLOW THE CARRIAGE CAN ONLY END IN
INJURY TO YOURSELF
HE OPENED THE DOOR AS HE SPOKE AND I HAD HARDLY TIME TO SPRING OUT
WHEN THE COACHMAN LASHED THE HORSE AND THE CARRIAGE RATTLED AWAY I
LOOKED AROUND ME IN ASTONISHMENT I WAS ON SOME SORT OF A HEATHY
COMMON MOTTLED OVER WITH DARK CLUMPS OF FURZEBUSHES FAR AWAY
STRETCHED A LINE OF HOUSES WITH A LIGHT HERE AND THERE IN THE UPPER
WINDOWS ON THE OTHER SIDE I SAW THE RED SIGNALLAMPS OF A RAILWAY
THE CARRIAGE WHICH HAD BROUGHT ME WAS ALREADY OUT OF SIGHT I STOOD
GAZING ROUND AND WONDERING WHERE ON EARTH I MIGHT BE WHEN I SAW SOME
ONE COMING TOWARDS ME IN THE DARKNESS AS HE CAME UP TO ME I MADE
OUT THAT HE WAS A RAILWAY PORTER
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT PLACE THIS IS I ASKED
WANDSWORTH COMMON SAID HE
CAN I GET A TRAIN INTO TOWN
IF YOU WALK ON A MILE OR SO TO CLAPHAM JUNCTION SAID HE YOULL
JUST BE IN TIME FOR THE LAST TO VICTORIA
SO THAT WAS THE END OF MY ADVENTURE MR HOLMES I DO NOT KNOW
WHERE I WAS NOR WHOM I SPOKE WITH NOR ANYTHING SAVE WHAT I HAVE
TOLD YOU BUT I KNOW THAT THERE IS FOUL PLAY GOING ON AND I WANT TO
HELP THAT UNHAPPY MAN IF I CAN I TOLD THE WHOLE STORY TO MR
MYCROFT HOLMES NEXT MORNING AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO THE POLICE
WE ALL SAT IN SILENCE FOR SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER LISTENING TO THIS
EXTRAORDINARY NARRATIVE THEN SHERLOCK LOOKED ACROSS AT HIS BROTHER
ANY STEPS HE ASKED
MYCROFT PICKED UP THE DAILY NEWS WHICH WAS LYING ON THE SIDETABLE
ANYBODY SUPPLYING ANY INFORMATION AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF A GREEK
GENTLEMAN NAMED PAUL KRATIDES FROM ATHENS WHO IS UNABLE TO SPEAK
ENGLISH WILL BE REWARDED A SIMILAR REWARD PAID TO ANY ONE GIVING
INFORMATION ABOUT A GREEK LADY WHOSE FIRST NAME IS SOPHY X THAT WAS IN
ALL THE DAILIES NO ANSWER
HOW ABOUT THE GREEK LEGATION
I HAVE INQUIRED THEY KNOW NOTHING
A WIRE TO THE HEAD OF THE ATHENS POLICE THEN
SHERLOCK HAS ALL THE ENERGY OF THE FAMILY SAID MYCROFT TURNING TO
ME WELL YOU TAKE THE CASE UP BY ALL MEANS AND LET ME KNOW IF YOU
DO ANY GOOD
CERTAINLY ANSWERED MY FRIEND RISING FROM HIS CHAIR ILL LET
YOU KNOW AND MR MELAS ALSO IN THE MEANTIME MR MELAS I SHOULD
CERTAINLY BE ON MY GUARD IF I WERE YOU FOR OF COURSE THEY MUST KNOW
THROUGH THESE ADVERTISEMENTS THAT YOU HAVE BETRAYED THEM
AS WE WALKED HOME TOGETHER HOLMES STOPPED AT A TELEGRAPH OFFICE AND
SENT OFF SEVERAL WIRES
YOU SEE WATSON HE REMARKED OUR EVENING HAS BEEN BY NO MEANS
WASTED SOME OF MY MOST INTERESTING CASES HAVE COME TO ME IN THIS
WAY THROUGH MYCROFT THE PROBLEM WHICH WE HAVE JUST LISTENED TO
ALTHOUGH IT CAN ADMIT OF BUT ONE EXPLANATION HAS STILL SOME
DISTINGUISHING FEATURES
YOU HAVE HOPES OF SOLVING IT
WELL KNOWING AS MUCH AS WE DO IT WILL BE SINGULAR INDEED IF WE
FAIL TO DISCOVER THE REST YOU MUST YOURSELF HAVE FORMED SOME THEORY
WHICH WILL EXPLAIN THE FACTS TO WHICH WE HAVE LISTENED
IN A VAGUE WAY YES
WHAT WAS YOUR IDEA THEN
IT SEEMED TO ME TO BE OBVIOUS THAT THIS GREEK GIRL HAD BEEN CARRIED
OFF BY THE YOUNG ENGLISHMAN NAMED HAROLD LATIMER
CARRIED OFF FROM WHERE
ATHENS PERHAPS
SHERLOCK HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD THIS YOUNG MAN COULD NOT TALK A
WORD OF GREEK THE LADY COULD TALK ENGLISH FAIRLY WELL INFERENCETHAT
SHE HAD BEEN IN ENGLAND SOME LITTLE TIME BUT HE HAD
NOT BEEN IN GREECE
WELL THEN WE WILL PRESUME THAT SHE HAD COME ON A VISIT TO ENGLAND
AND THAT THIS HAROLD HAD PERSUADED HER TO FLY WITH HIM
THAT IS MORE PROBABLE
THEN THE BROTHERFOR THAT I FANCY MUST BE THE RELATIONSHIPCOMES
OVER FROM GREECE TO INTERFERE HE IMPRUDENTLY PUTS HIMSELF INTO THE
POWER OF THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS OLDER ASSOCIATE THEY SEIZE HIM AND
USE VIOLENCE TOWARDS HIM IN ORDER TO MAKE HIM SIGN SOME PAPERS TO
MAKE OVER THE GIRLS FORTUNEOF WHICH HE MAY BE TRUSTEETO THEM THIS HE
REFUSES TO DO IN ORDER TO NEGOTIATE WITH HIM THEY HAVE TO
GET AN INTERPRETER AND THEY PITCH UPON THIS MR MELAS HAVING USED
SOME OTHER ONE BEFORE THE GIRL IS NOT TOLD OF THE ARRIVAL OF HER
BROTHER AND FINDS IT OUT BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT
EXCELLENT WATSON CRIED HOLMES I REALLY FANCY THAT YOU ARE NOT
FAR FROM THE TRUTH YOU SEE THAT WE HOLD ALL THE CARDS AND WE HAVE
ONLY TO FEAR SOME SUDDEN ACT OF VIOLENCE ON THEIR PART IF THEY GIVE
US TIME WE MUST HAVE THEM
BUT HOW CAN WE FIND WHERE THIS HOUSE LIES
WELL IF OUR CONJECTURE IS CORRECT AND THE GIRLS NAME IS OR WAS
SOPHY KRATIDES WE SHOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN TRACING HER THAT
MUST BE OUR MAIN HOPE FOR THE BROTHER IS OF COURSE A COMPLETE
STRANGER IT IS CLEAR THAT SOME TIME HAS ELAPSED SINCE THIS HAROLD
ESTABLISHED THESE RELATIONS WITH THE GIRLSOME WEEKS AT ANY
RATESINCE THE BROTHER IN GREECE HAS HAD TIME TO HEAR OF IT AND COME
ACROSS IF THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING IN THE SAME PLACE DURING THIS TIME
IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE SHALL HAVE SOME ANSWER TO MYCROFTS
ADVERTISEMENT
WE HAD REACHED OUR HOUSE IN BAKER STREET WHILE WE HAD BEEN TALKING
HOLMES ASCENDED THE STAIR FIRST AND AS HE OPENED THE DOOR OF OUR
ROOM HE GAVE A START OF SURPRISE LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER I WAS
EQUALLY ASTONISHED HIS BROTHER MYCROFT WAS SITTING SMOKING IN THE
ARMCHAIR
COME IN SHERLOCK COME IN SIR SAID HE BLANDLY SMILING AT OUR
SURPRISED FACES YOU DONT EXPECT SUCH ENERGY FROM ME DO YOU
SHERLOCK BUT SOMEHOW THIS CASE ATTRACTS ME
HOW DID YOU GET HERE
I PASSED YOU IN A HANSOM
THERE HAS BEEN SOME NEW DEVELOPMENT
I HAD AN ANSWER TO MY ADVERTISEMENT
AH
YES IT CAME WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF YOUR LEAVING
AND TO WHAT EFFECT
MYCROFT HOLMES TOOK OUT A SHEET OF PAPER
HERE IT IS SAID HE WRITTEN WITH A J PEN ON ROYAL CREAM PAPER BY
A MIDDLEAGED MAN WITH A WEAK CONSTITUTION
SIR HE SAYS
IN ANSWER TO YOUR ADVERTISEMENT OF TODAYS DATE I BEG TO INFORM
YOU THAT I KNOW THE YOUNG LADY IN QUESTION VERY WELL IF YOU SHOULD
CARE TO CALL UPON ME I COULD GIVE YOU SOME PARTICULARS AS TO HER
PAINFUL HISTORY SHE IS LIVING AT PRESENT AT THE MYRTLES BECKENHAM
YOURS FAITHFULLY
J DAVENPORT
HE WRITES FROM LOWER BRIXTON SAID MYCROFT HOLMES DO YOU NOT
THINK THAT WE MIGHT DRIVE TO HIM NOW SHERLOCK AND LEARN THESE
PARTICULARS
MY DEAR MYCROFT THE BROTHERS LIFE IS MORE VALUABLE THAN THE
SISTERS STORY I THINK WE SHOULD CALL AT SCOTLAND YARD FOR
INSPECTOR GREGSON AND GO STRAIGHT OUT TO BECKENHAM WE KNOW THAT A
MAN IS BEING DONE TO DEATH AND EVERY HOUR MAY BE VITAL
BETTER PICK UP MR MELAS ON OUR WAY I SUGGESTED WE MAY NEED AN
INTERPRETER
EXCELLENT SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES SEND THE BOY FOR A FOURWHEELER
AND WE SHALL BE OFF AT ONCE HE OPENED THE TABLEDRAWER AS HE
SPOKE AND I NOTICED THAT HE SLIPPED HIS REVOLVER INTO HIS POCKET YES
SAID HE IN ANSWER TO MY GLANCE I SHOULD SAY FROM WHAT WE
HAVE HEARD THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS GANG
IT WAS ALMOST DARK BEFORE WE FOUND OURSELVES IN PALL MALL AT THE
ROOMS OF MR MELAS A GENTLEMAN HAD JUST CALLED FOR HIM AND HE WAS
GONE
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE ASKED MYCROFT HOLMES
I DONT KNOW SIR ANSWERED THE WOMAN WHO HAD OPENED THE DOOR I
ONLY KNOW THAT HE DROVE AWAY WITH THE GENTLEMAN IN A CARRIAGE
DID THE GENTLEMAN GIVE A NAME
NO SIR
HE WASNT A TALL HANDSOME DARK YOUNG MAN
OH NO SIR HE WAS A LITTLE GENTLEMAN WITH GLASSES THIN IN THE
FACE BUT VERY PLEASANT IN HIS WAYS FOR HE WAS LAUGHING ALL THE TIME
THAT HE WAS TALKING
COME ALONG CRIED SHERLOCK HOLMES ABRUPTLY THIS GROWS SERIOUS
HE OBSERVED AS WE DROVE TO SCOTLAND YARD THESE MEN HAVE GOT HOLD
OF MELAS AGAIN HE IS A MAN OF NO PHYSICAL COURAGE AS THEY ARE WELL
AWARE FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE THE OTHER NIGHT THIS VILLAIN WAS ABLE
TO TERRORIZE HIM THE INSTANT THAT HE GOT INTO HIS PRESENCE NO DOUBT
THEY WANT HIS PROFESSIONAL SERVICES BUT HAVING USED HIM THEY MAY
BE INCLINED TO PUNISH HIM FOR WHAT THEY WILL REGARD AS HIS
TREACHERY
OUR HOPE WAS THAT BY TAKING TRAIN WE MIGHT GET TO BECKENHAM AS SOON
OR SOONER THAN THE CARRIAGE ON REACHING SCOTLAND YARD HOWEVER IT
WAS MORE THAN AN HOUR BEFORE WE COULD GET INSPECTOR GREGSON AND
COMPLY WITH THE LEGAL FORMALITIES WHICH WOULD ENABLE US TO ENTER THE
HOUSE IT WAS A QUARTER TO TEN BEFORE WE REACHED LONDON BRIDGE AND
HALF PAST BEFORE THE FOUR OF US ALIGHTED ON THE BECKENHAM PLATFORM A
DRIVE OF HALF A MILE BROUGHT US TO THE MYRTLESA LARGE DARK HOUSE
STANDING BACK FROM THE ROAD IN ITS OWN GROUNDS HERE WE DISMISSED
OUR CAB AND MADE OUR WAY UP THE DRIVE TOGETHER
THE WINDOWS ARE ALL DARK REMARKED THE INSPECTOR THE HOUSE SEEMS
DESERTED
OUR BIRDS ARE FLOWN AND THE NEST EMPTY SAID HOLMES
WHY DO YOU SAY SO
A CARRIAGE HEAVILY LOADED WITH LUGGAGE HAS PASSED OUT DURING THE
LAST HOUR
THE INSPECTOR LAUGHED I SAW THE WHEELTRACKS IN THE LIGHT OF THE
GATELAMP BUT WHERE DOES THE LUGGAGE COME IN
YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED THE SAME WHEELTRACKS GOING THE OTHER WAY BUT THE
OUTWARDBOUND ONES WERE VERY MUCH DEEPERSO MUCH SO THAT WE
CAN SAY FOR A CERTAINTY THAT THERE WAS A VERY CONSIDERABLE WEIGHT ON
THE CARRIAGE
YOU GET A TRIFLE BEYOND ME THERE SAID THE INSPECTOR SHRUGGING HIS
SHOULDER IT WILL NOT BE AN EASY DOOR TO FORCE BUT WE WILL TRY IF
WE CANNOT MAKE SOME ONE HEAR US
HE HAMMERED LOUDLY AT THE KNOCKER AND PULLED AT THE BELL BUT WITHOUT
ANY SUCCESS HOLMES HAD SLIPPED AWAY BUT HE CAME BACK IN A FEW
MINUTES
I HAVE A WINDOW OPEN SAID HE
IT IS A MERCY THAT YOU ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE FORCE AND NOT AGAINST
IT MR HOLMES REMARKED THE INSPECTOR AS HE NOTED THE CLEVER WAY
IN WHICH MY FRIEND HAD FORCED BACK THE CATCH WELL I THINK THAT
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY ENTER WITHOUT AN INVITATION
ONE AFTER THE OTHER WE MADE OUR WAY INTO A LARGE APARTMENT WHICH WAS
EVIDENTLY THAT IN WHICH MR MELAS HAD FOUND HIMSELF THE INSPECTOR
HAD LIT HIS LANTERN AND BY ITS LIGHT WE COULD SEE THE TWO DOORS THE
CURTAIN THE LAMP AND THE SUIT OF JAPANESE MAIL AS HE HAD DESCRIBED
THEM ON THE TABLE LAY TWO GLASSES AND EMPTY BRANDYBOTTLE AND THE
REMAINS OF A MEAL
WHAT IS THAT ASKED HOLMES SUDDENLY
WE ALL STOOD STILL AND LISTENED A LOW MOANING SOUND WAS COMING FROM
SOMEWHERE OVER OUR HEADS HOLMES RUSHED TO THE DOOR AND OUT INTO THE
HALL THE DISMAL NOISE CAME FROM UPSTAIRS HE DASHED UP THE
INSPECTOR AND I AT HIS HEELS WHILE HIS BROTHER MYCROFT FOLLOWED AS
QUICKLY AS HIS GREAT BULK WOULD PERMIT
THREE DOORS FACED UP UPON THE SECOND FLOOR AND IT WAS FROM THE
CENTRAL OF THESE THAT THE SINISTER SOUNDS WERE ISSUING SINKING
SOMETIMES INTO A DULL MUMBLE AND RISING AGAIN INTO A SHRILL WHINE IT
WAS LOCKED BUT THE KEY HAD BEEN LEFT ON THE OUTSIDE HOLMES
FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND RUSHED IN BUT HE WAS OUT AGAIN IN AN
INSTANT WITH HIS HAND TO HIS THROAT
ITS CHARCOAL HE CRIED GIVE IT TIME IT WILL CLEAR
PEERING IN WE COULD SEE THAT THE ONLY LIGHT IN THE ROOM CAME FROM A
DULL BLUE FLAME WHICH FLICKERED FROM A SMALL BRASS TRIPOD IN THE
CENTRE IT THREW A LIVID UNNATURAL CIRCLE UPON THE FLOOR WHILE IN
THE SHADOWS BEYOND WE SAW THE VAGUE LOOM OF TWO FIGURES WHICH
CROUCHED AGAINST THE WALL FROM THE OPEN DOOR THERE REEKED A
HORRIBLE POISONOUS EXHALATION WHICH SET US GASPING AND COUGHING HOLMES
RUSHED TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRS TO DRAW IN THE FRESH AIR AND
THEN DASHING INTO THE ROOM HE THREW UP THE WINDOW AND HURLED THE
BRAZEN TRIPOD OUT INTO THE GARDEN
WE CAN ENTER IN A MINUTE HE GASPED DARTING OUT AGAIN WHERE IS
A CANDLE I DOUBT IF WE COULD STRIKE A MATCH IN THAT ATMOSPHERE HOLD
THE LIGHT AT THE DOOR AND WE SHALL GET THEM OUT MYCROFT NOW
WITH A RUSH WE GOT TO THE POISONED MEN AND DRAGGED THEM OUT INTO THE
WELLLIT HALL BOTH OF THEM WERE BLUELIPPED AND INSENSIBLE WITH
SWOLLEN CONGESTED FACES AND PROTRUDING EYES INDEED SO DISTORTED
WERE THEIR FEATURES THAT SAVE FOR HIS BLACK BEARD AND STOUT FIGURE
WE MIGHT HAVE FAILED TO RECOGNIZE IN ONE OF THEM THE GREEK
INTERPRETER WHO HAD PARTED FROM US ONLY A FEW HOURS BEFORE AT THE
DIOGENES CLUB HIS HANDS AND FEET WERE SECURELY STRAPPED TOGETHER
AND HE BORE OVER ONE EYE THE MARKS OF A VIOLENT BLOW THE OTHER WHO
WAS SECURED IN A SIMILAR FASHION WAS A TALL MAN IN THE LAST STAGE OF
EMACIATION WITH SEVERAL STRIPS OF STICKINGPLASTER ARRANGED IN A
GROTESQUE PATTERN OVER HIS FACE HE HAD CEASED TO MOAN AS WE LAID
HIM DOWN AND A GLANCE SHOWED ME THAT FOR HIM AT LEAST OUR AID HAD
COME TOO LATE MR MELAS HOWEVER STILL LIVED AND IN LESS THAN AN
HOUR WITH THE AID OF AMMONIA AND BRANDY I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF
SEEING HIM OPEN HIS EYES AND OF KNOWING THAT MY HAND HAD DRAWN HIM
BACK FROM THAT DARK VALLEY IN WHICH ALL PATHS MEET
IT WAS A SIMPLE STORY WHICH HE HAD TO TELL AND ONE WHICH DID BUT
CONFIRM OUR OWN DEDUCTIONS HIS VISITOR ON ENTERING HIS ROOMS HAD
DRAWN A LIFEPRESERVER FROM HIS SLEEVE AND HAD SO IMPRESSED HIM WITH
THE FEAR OF INSTANT AND INEVITABLE DEATH THAT HE HAD KIDNAPPED HIM
FOR THE SECOND TIME INDEED IT WAS ALMOST MESMERIC THE EFFECT
WHICH THIS GIGGLING RUFFIAN HAD PRODUCED UPON THE UNFORTUNATE
LINGUIST FOR HE COULD NOT SPEAK OF HIM SAVE WITH TREMBLING HANDS AND
A BLANCHED CHEEK HE HAD BEEN TAKEN SWIFTLY TO BECKENHAM AND HAD
ACTED AS INTERPRETER IN A SECOND INTERVIEW EVEN MORE DRAMATIC THAN
THE FIRST IN WHICH THE TWO ENGLISHMEN HAD MENACED THEIR PRISONER
WITH INSTANT DEATH IF HE DID NOT COMPLY WITH THEIR DEMANDS FINALLY
FINDING HIM PROOF AGAINST EVERY THREAT THEY HAD HURLED HIM BACK INTO
HIS PRISON AND AFTER REPROACHING MELAS WITH HIS TREACHERY WHICH
APPEARED FROM THE NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENT THEY HAD STUNNED HIM WITH
A BLOW FROM A STICK AND HE REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE UNTIL HE FOUND US
BENDING OVER HIM
AND THIS WAS THE SINGULAR CASE OF THE GRECIAN INTERPRETER THE
EXPLANATION OF WHICH IS STILL INVOLVED IN SOME MYSTERY WE WERE ABLE
TO FIND OUT BY COMMUNICATING WITH THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAD ANSWERED THE
ADVERTISEMENT THAT THE UNFORTUNATE YOUNG LADY CAME OF A WEALTHY
GRECIAN FAMILY AND THAT SHE HAD BEEN ON A VISIT TO SOME FRIENDS IN
ENGLAND WHILE THERE SHE HAD MET A YOUNG MAN NAMED HAROLD LATIMER
WHO HAD ACQUIRED AN ASCENDANCY OVER HER AND HAD EVENTUALLY PERSUADED
HER TO FLY WITH HIM HER FRIENDS SHOCKED AT THE EVENT HAD
CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH INFORMING HER BROTHER AT ATHENS AND HAD
THEN WASHED THEIR HANDS OF THE MATTER THE BROTHER ON HIS ARRIVAL
IN ENGLAND HAD IMPRUDENTLY PLACED HIMSELF IN THE POWER OF LATIMER
AND OF HIS ASSOCIATE WHOSE NAME WAS WILSON KEMPA MAN OF THE
FOULEST ANTECEDENTS THESE TWO FINDING THAT THROUGH HIS IGNORANCE
OF THE LANGUAGE HE WAS HELPLESS IN THEIR HANDS HAD KEPT HIM A
PRISONER AND HAD ENDEAVORED BY CRUELTY AND STARVATION TO MAKE HIM
SIGN AWAY HIS OWN AND HIS SISTERS PROPERTY THEY HAD KEPT HIM IN
THE HOUSE WITHOUT THE GIRLS KNOWLEDGE AND THE PLASTER OVER THE FACE
HAD BEEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING RECOGNITION DIFFICULT IN CASE SHE
SHOULD EVER CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM HER FEMININE PERCEPTION
HOWEVER HAD INSTANTLY SEEN THROUGH THE DISGUISE WHEN ON THE
OCCASION OF THE INTERPRETERS VISIT SHE HAD SEEN HIM FOR THE FIRST
TIME THE POOR GIRL HOWEVER WAS HERSELF A PRISONER FOR THERE WAS
NO ONE ABOUT THE HOUSE EXCEPT THE MAN WHO ACTED AS COACHMAN AND HIS
WIFE BOTH OF WHOM WERE TOOLS OF THE CONSPIRATORS FINDING THAT
THEIR SECRET WAS OUT AND THAT THEIR PRISONER WAS NOT TO BE COERCED
THE TWO VILLAINS WITH THE GIRL HAD FLED AWAY AT A FEW HOURS NOTICE
FROM THE FURNISHED HOUSE WHICH THEY HAD HIRED HAVING FIRST AS THEY
THOUGHT TAKEN VENGEANCE BOTH UPON THE MAN WHO HAD DEFIED AND THE ONE
WHO HAD BETRAYED THEM
MONTHS AFTERWARDS A CURIOUS NEWSPAPER CUTTING REACHED US FROM
BUDAPESTH IT TOLD HOW TWO ENGLISHMEN WHO HAD BEEN TRAVELING WITH A
WOMAN HAD MET WITH A TRAGIC END THEY HAD EACH BEEN STABBED IT
SEEMS AND THE HUNGARIAN POLICE WERE OF OPINION THAT THEY HAD
QUARRELED AND HAD INFLICTED MORTAL INJURIES UPON EACH OTHER HOLMES
HOWEVER IS I FANCY OF A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING AND HOLDS TO
THIS DAY THAT IF ONE COULD FIND THE GRECIAN GIRL ONE MIGHT LEARN
HOW THE WRONGS OF HERSELF AND HER BROTHER CAME TO BE AVENGED
THE NAVAL TREATY
THE JULY WHICH IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDED MY MARRIAGE WAS MADE MEMORABLE
BY THREE CASES OF INTEREST IN WHICH I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING
ASSOCIATED WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES AND OF STUDYING HIS METHODS I FIND
THEM RECORDED IN MY NOTES UNDER THE HEADINGS OF THE ADVENTURE OF THE
SECOND STAIN THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY AND THE
ADVENTURE OF THE TIRED CAPTAIN THE FIRST OF THESE HOWEVER DEALS
WITH INTEREST OF SUCH IMPORTANCE AND IMPLICATES SO MANY OF THE FIRST
FAMILIES IN THE KINGDOM THAT FOR MANY YEARS IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO
MAKE IT PUBLIC NO CASE HOWEVER IN WHICH HOLMES WAS ENGAGED HAS
EVER ILLUSTRATED THE VALUE OF HIS ANALYTICAL METHODS SO CLEARLY OR
HAS IMPRESSED THOSE WHO WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIM SO DEEPLY I STILL
RETAIN AN ALMOST VERBATIM REPORT OF THE INTERVIEW IN WHICH HE
DEMONSTRATED THE TRUE FACTS OF THE CASE TO MONSIEUR DUBUGUE OF THE
PARIS POLICE AND FRITZ VON WALDBAUM THE WELLKNOWN SPECIALIST OF
DANTZIG BOTH OF WHOM HAD WASTED THEIR ENERGIES UPON WHAT PROVED TO
BE SIDEISSUES THE NEW CENTURY WILL HAVE COME HOWEVER BEFORE THE
STORY CAN BE SAFELY TOLD MEANWHILE I PASS ON TO THE SECOND ON MY
LIST WHICH PROMISED ALSO AT ONE TIME TO BE OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE
AND WAS MARKED BY SEVERAL INCIDENTS WHICH GIVE IT A QUITE UNIQUE
CHARACTER
DURING MY SCHOOLDAYS I HAD BEEN INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH A LAD
NAMED PERCY PHELPS WHO WAS OF MUCH THE SAME AGE AS MYSELF THOUGH HE
WAS TWO CLASSES AHEAD OF ME HE WAS A VERY BRILLIANT BOY AND CARRIED
AWAY EVERY PRIZE WHICH THE SCHOOL HAD TO OFFER FINISHING HIS
EXPLOITS BY WINNING A SCHOLARSHIP WHICH SENT HIM ON TO CONTINUE HIS
TRIUMPHANT CAREER AT CAMBRIDGE HE WAS I REMEMBER EXTREMELY WELL
CONNECTED AND EVEN WHEN WE WERE ALL LITTLE BOYS TOGETHER WE KNEW
THAT HIS MOTHERS BROTHER WAS LORD HOLDHURST THE GREAT CONSERVATIVE
POLITICIAN THIS GAUDY RELATIONSHIP DID HIM LITTLE GOOD AT SCHOOL ON
THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED RATHER A PIQUANT THING TO US TO CHEVY HIM
ABOUT THE PLAYGROUND AND HIT HIM OVER THE SHINS WITH A WICKET BUT IT
WAS ANOTHER THING WHEN HE CAME OUT INTO THE WORLD I HEARD VAGUELY
THAT HIS ABILITIES AND THE INFLUENCES WHICH HE COMMANDED HAD WON HIM
A GOOD POSITION AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND THEN HE PASSED COMPLETELY
OUT OF MY MIND UNTIL THE FOLLOWING LETTER RECALLED HIS EXISTENCE
BRIARBRAE WOKING
MY DEAR WATSON
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER TADPOLE PHELPS WHO WAS IN
THE FIFTH FORM WHEN YOU WERE IN THE THIRD IT IS POSSIBLE EVEN THAT
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT THROUGH MY UNCLES INFLUENCE I OBTAINED A
GOOD APPOINTMENT AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND THAT I WAS IN A SITUATION
OF TRUST AND HONOR UNTIL A HORRIBLE MISFORTUNE CAME SUDDENLY TO BLAST
MY CAREER
THERE IS NO USE WRITING OF THE DETAILS OF THAT DREADFUL EVENT IN THE
EVENT OF YOUR ACCEDING TO MY REQUEST IT IS PROBABLE THAT I SHALL HAVE
TO NARRATE THEM TO YOU I HAVE ONLY JUST RECOVERED FROM NINE WEEKS OF
BRAINFEVER AND AM STILL EXCEEDINGLY WEAK DO YOU THINK THAT YOU
COULD BRING YOUR FRIEND MR HOLMES DOWN TO SEE ME I SHOULD LIKE TO
HAVE HIS OPINION OF THE CASE THOUGH THE AUTHORITIES ASSURE ME THAT
NOTHING MORE CAN BE DONE DO TRY TO BRING HIM DOWN AND AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE EVERY MINUTE SEEMS AN HOUR WHILE I LIVE IN THIS STATE OF
HORRIBLE SUSPENSE ASSURE HIM THAT IF I HAVE NOT ASKED HIS ADVICE
SOONER IT WAS NOT BECAUSE I DID NOT APPRECIATE HIS TALENTS BUT
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN OFF MY HEAD EVER SINCE THE BLOW FELL NOW I AM
CLEAR AGAIN THOUGH I DARE NOT THINK OF IT TOO MUCH FOR FEAR OF A
RELAPSE I AM STILL SO WEAK THAT I HAVE TO WRITE AS YOU SEE BY
DICTATING DO TRY TO BRING HIM
YOUR OLD SCHOOLFELLOW
PERCY PHELPS
THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT TOUCHED ME AS I READ THIS LETTER SOMETHING
PITIABLE IN THE REITERATED APPEALS TO BRING HOLMES SO MOVED WAS I
THAT EVEN HAD IT BEEN A DIFFICULT MATTER I SHOULD HAVE TRIED IT BUT
OF COURSE I KNEW WELL THAT HOLMES LOVED HIS ART SO THAT HE WAS EVER
AS READY TO BRING HIS AID AS HIS CLIENT COULD BE TO RECEIVE IT MY
WIFE AGREED WITH ME THAT NOT A MOMENT SHOULD BE LOST IN LAYING THE
MATTER BEFORE HIM AND SO WITHIN AN HOUR OF BREAKFASTTIME I FOUND
MYSELF BACK ONCE MORE IN THE OLD ROOMS IN BAKER STREET
HOLMES WAS SEATED AT HIS SIDETABLE CLAD IN HIS DRESSINGGOWN AND
WORKING HARD OVER A CHEMICAL INVESTIGATION A LARGE CURVED RETORT WAS
BOILING FURIOUSLY IN THE BLUISH FLAME OF A BUNSEN BURNER AND THE
DISTILLED DROPS WERE CONDENSING INTO A TWOLITRE MEASURE MY FRIEND
HARDLY GLANCED UP AS I ENTERED AND I SEEING THAT HIS INVESTIGATION
MUST BE OF IMPORTANCE SEATED MYSELF IN AN ARMCHAIR AND WAITED HE
DIPPED INTO THIS BOTTLE OR THAT DRAWING OUT A FEW DROPS OF EACH WITH
HIS GLASS PIPETTE AND FINALLY BROUGHT A TESTTUBE CONTAINING A
SOLUTION OVER TO THE TABLE IN HIS RIGHT HAND HE HELD A SLIP OF
LITMUSPAPER
YOU COME AT A CRISIS WATSON SAID HE IF THIS PAPER REMAINS BLUE
ALL IS WELL IF IT TURNS RED IT MEANS A MANS LIFE HE DIPPED IT
INTO THE TESTTUBE AND IT FLUSHED AT ONCE INTO A DULL DIRTY CRIMSON
HUM I THOUGHT AS MUCH HE CRIED I WILL BE AT YOUR SERVICE IN AN
INSTANT WATSON YOU WILL FIND TOBACCO IN THE PERSIAN SLIPPER HE
TURNED TO HIS DESK AND SCRIBBLED OFF SEVERAL TELEGRAMS WHICH WERE
HANDED OVER TO THE PAGEBOY THEN HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN INTO THE
CHAIR OPPOSITE AND DREW UP HIS KNEES UNTIL HIS FINGERS CLASPED ROUND
HIS LONG THIN SHINS
A VERY COMMONPLACE LITTLE MURDER SAID HE YOUVE GOT SOMETHING
BETTER I FANCY YOU ARE THE STORMY PETREL OF CRIME WATSON WHAT IS
IT
I HANDED HIM THE LETTER WHICH HE READ WITH THE MOST CONCENTRATED
ATTENTION
IT DOES NOT TELL US VERY MUCH DOES IT HE REMARKED AS HE HANDED
IT BACK TO ME
HARDLY ANYTHING
AND YET THE WRITING IS OF INTEREST
BUT THE WRITING IS NOT HIS OWN
PRECISELY IT IS A WOMANS
A MANS SURELY I CRIED
NO A WOMANS AND A WOMAN OF RARE CHARACTER YOU SEE AT THE
COMMENCEMENT OF AN INVESTIGATION IT IS SOMETHING TO KNOW THAT YOUR
CLIENT IS IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH SOME ONE WHO FOR GOOD OR EVIL HAS
AN EXCEPTIONAL NATURE MY INTEREST IS ALREADY AWAKENED IN THE CASE
IF YOU ARE READY WE WILL START AT ONCE FOR WOKING AND SEE THIS
DIPLOMATIST WHO IS IN SUCH EVIL CASE AND THE LADY TO WHOM HE
DICTATES HIS LETTERS
WE WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO CATCH AN EARLY TRAIN AT WATERLOO AND IN
A LITTLE UNDER AN HOUR WE FOUND OURSELVES AMONG THE FIRWOODS AND THE
HEATHER OF WOKING BRIARBRAE PROVED TO BE A LARGE DETACHED HOUSE
STANDING IN EXTENSIVE GROUNDS WITHIN A FEW MINUTES WALK OF THE
STATION ON SENDING IN OUR CARDS WE WERE SHOWN INTO AN ELEGANTLY
APPOINTED DRAWINGROOM WHERE WE WERE JOINED IN A FEW MINUTES BY A
RATHER STOUT MAN WHO RECEIVED US WITH MUCH HOSPITALITY HIS AGE MAY
HAVE BEEN NEARER FORTY THAN THIRTY BUT HIS CHEEKS WERE SO RUDDY AND
HIS EYES SO MERRY THAT HE STILL CONVEYED THE IMPRESSION OF A PLUMP
AND MISCHIEVOUS BOY
I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU HAVE COME SAID HE SHAKING OUR HANDS WITH
EFFUSION PERCY HAS BEEN INQUIRING FOR YOU ALL MORNING AH POOR OLD
CHAP HE CLINGS TO ANY STRAW HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER ASKED ME TO
SEE YOU FOR THE MERE MENTION OF THE SUBJECT IS VERY PAINFUL TO
THEM
WE HAVE HAD NO DETAILS YET OBSERVED HOLMES I PERCEIVE THAT YOU
ARE NOT YOURSELF A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
OUR ACQUAINTANCE LOOKED SURPRISED AND THEN GLANCING DOWN HE BEGAN
TO LAUGH
OF COURSE YOU SAW THE J H MONOGRAM ON MY LOCKET SAID HE FOR A
MOMENT I THOUGHT YOU HAD DONE SOMETHING CLEVER JOSEPH HARRISON IS MY
NAME AND AS PERCY IS TO MARRY MY SISTER ANNIE I SHALL AT LEAST BE A
RELATION BY MARRIAGE YOU WILL FIND MY SISTER IN HIS ROOM FOR SHE
HAS NURSED HIM HANDANDFOOT THIS TWO MONTHS BACK PERHAPS WED
BETTER GO IN AT ONCE FOR I KNOW HOW IMPATIENT HE IS
THE CHAMBER IN WHICH WE WERE SHOWN WAS ON THE SAME FLOOR AS THE
DRAWINGROOM IT WAS FURNISHED PARTLY AS A SITTING AND PARTLY AS A
BEDROOM WITH FLOWERS ARRANGED DAINTILY IN EVERY NOOK AND CORNER A
YOUNG MAN VERY PALE AND WORN WAS LYING UPON A SOFA NEAR THE OPEN
WINDOW THROUGH WHICH CAME THE RICH SCENT OF THE GARDEN AND THE BALMY
SUMMER AIR A WOMAN WAS SITTING BESIDE HIM WHO ROSE AS WE ENTERED
SHALL I LEAVE PERCY SHE ASKED
HE CLUTCHED HER HAND TO DETAIN HER HOW ARE YOU WATSON SAID HE
CORDIALLY I SHOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN YOU UNDER THAT MOUSTACHE AND I
DARE SAY YOU WOULD NOT BE PREPARED TO SWEAR TO ME THIS I PRESUME IS
YOUR CELEBRATED FRIEND MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
I INTRODUCED HIM IN A FEW WORDS AND WE BOTH SAT DOWN THE STOUT
YOUNG MAN HAD LEFT US BUT HIS SISTER STILL REMAINED WITH HER HAND IN
THAT OF THE INVALID SHE WAS A STRIKINGLOOKING WOMAN A LITTLE SHORT
AND THICK FOR SYMMETRY BUT WITH A BEAUTIFUL OLIVE COMPLEXION LARGE
DARK ITALIAN EYES AND A WEALTH OF DEEP BLACK HAIR HER RICH TINTS
MADE THE WHITE FACE OF HER COMPANION THE MORE WORN AND HAGGARD BY THE
CONTRAST
I WONT WASTE YOUR TIME SAID HE RAISING HIMSELF UPON THE SOFA
ILL PLUNGE INTO THE MATTER WITHOUT FURTHER PREAMBLE I WAS A HAPPY
AND SUCCESSFUL MAN MR HOLMES AND ON THE EVE OF BEING MARRIED WHEN
A SUDDEN AND DREADFUL MISFORTUNE WRECKED ALL MY PROSPECTS IN LIFE
I WAS AS WATSON MAY HAVE TOLD YOU IN THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND
THROUGH THE INFLUENCES OF MY UNCLE LORD HOLDHURST I ROSE RAPIDLY TO
A RESPONSIBLE POSITION WHEN MY UNCLE BECAME FOREIGN MINISTER IN THIS
ADMINISTRATION HE GAVE ME SEVERAL MISSIONS OF TRUST AND AS I ALWAYS
BROUGHT THEM TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION HE CAME AT LAST TO HAVE THE
UTMOST CONFIDENCE IN MY ABILITY AND TACT
NEARLY TEN WEEKS AGOTO BE MORE ACCURATE ON THE TWENTYTHIRD OF
MAYHE CALLED ME INTO HIS PRIVATE ROOM AND AFTER COMPLIMENTING ME
ON THE GOOD WORK WHICH I HAD DONE HE INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD A NEW
COMMISSION OF TRUST FOR ME TO EXECUTE
THIS SAID HE TAKING A GRAY ROLL OF PAPER FROM HIS BUREAU IS
THE ORIGINAL OF THAT SECRET TREATY BETWEEN ENGLAND AND ITALY OF
WHICH I REGRET TO SAY SOME RUMORS HAVE ALREADY GOT INTO THE PUBLIC
PRESS IT IS OF ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE THAT NOTHING FURTHER SHOULD LEAK
OUT THE FRENCH OR THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY WOULD PAY AN IMMENSE SUM TO
LEARN THE CONTENTS OF THESE PAPERS THEY SHOULD NOT LEAVE MY BUREAU
WERE IT NOT THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO HAVE THEM COPIED YOU
HAVE A DESK IN YOUR OFFICE
YES SIR
THEN TAKE THE TREATY AND LOCK IT UP THERE I SHALL GIVE DIRECTIONS
THAT YOU MAY REMAIN BEHIND WHEN THE OTHERS GO SO THAT YOU MAY COPY
IT AT YOUR LEISURE WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING OVERLOOKED WHEN YOU HAVE
FINISHED RELOCK BOTH THE ORIGINAL AND THE DRAFT IN THE DESK AND
HAND THEM OVER TO ME PERSONALLY TOMORROW MORNING
I TOOK THE PAPERS AND
EXCUSE ME AN INSTANT SAID HOLMES WERE YOU ALONE DURING THIS
CONVERSATION
ABSOLUTELY
IN A LARGE ROOM
THIRTY FEET EACH WAY
IN THE CENTRE
YES ABOUT IT
AND SPEAKING LOW
MY UNCLES VOICE IS ALWAYS REMARKABLY LOW I HARDLY SPOKE AT ALL
THANK YOU SAID HOLMES SHUTTING HIS EYES PRAY GO ON
I DID EXACTLY WHAT HE INDICATED AND WAITED UNTIL THE OTHER CLERKS
HAD DEPARTED ONE OF THEM IN MY ROOM CHARLES GOROT HAD SOME ARREARS
OF WORK TO MAKE UP SO I LEFT HIM THERE AND WENT OUT TO DINE WHEN I
RETURNED HE WAS GONE I WAS ANXIOUS TO HURRY MY WORK FOR I KNEW THAT
JOSEPHTHE MR HARRISON WHOM YOU SAW JUST NOWWAS IN TOWN AND THAT
HE WOULD TRAVEL DOWN TO WOKING BY THE ELEVENOCLOCK TRAIN AND I
WANTED IF POSSIBLE TO CATCH IT
WHEN I CAME TO EXAMINE THE TREATY I SAW AT ONCE THAT IT WAS OF SUCH
IMPORTANCE THAT MY UNCLE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF NO EXAGGERATION IN WHAT
HE HAD SAID WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAILS I MAY SAY THAT IT DEFINED
THE POSITION OF GREAT BRITAIN TOWARDS THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE AND
FORESHADOWED THE POLICY WHICH THIS COUNTRY WOULD PURSUE IN THE EVENT
OF THE FRENCH FLEET GAINING A COMPLETE ASCENDANCY OVER THAT OF ITALY
IN THE MEDITERRANEAN THE QUESTIONS TREATED IN IT WERE PURELY NAVAL
AT THE END WERE THE SIGNATURES OF THE HIGH DIGNITARIES WHO HAD SIGNED
IT I GLANCED MY EYES OVER IT AND THEN SETTLED DOWN TO MY TASK OF
COPYING
IT WAS A LONG DOCUMENT WRITTEN IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AND
CONTAINING TWENTYSIX SEPARATE ARTICLES I COPIED AS QUICKLY AS I
COULD BUT AT NINE OCLOCK I HAD ONLY DONE NINE ARTICLES AND IT
SEEMED HOPELESS FOR ME TO ATTEMPT TO CATCH MY TRAIN I WAS FEELING
DROWSY AND STUPID PARTLY FROM MY DINNER AND ALSO FROM THE EFFECTS OF
A LONG DAYS WORK A CUP OF COFFEE WOULD CLEAR MY BRAIN A
COMMISSIONAIRE REMAINS ALL NIGHT IN A LITTLE LODGE AT THE FOOT OF THE
STAIRS AND IS IN THE HABIT OF MAKING COFFEE AT HIS SPIRITLAMP FOR
ANY OF THE OFFICIALS WHO MAY BE WORKING OVER TIME I RANG THE BELL
THEREFORE TO SUMMON HIM
TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS A WOMAN WHO ANSWERED THE SUMMONS A LARGE
COARSEFACED ELDERLY WOMAN IN AN APRON SHE EXPLAINED THAT SHE WAS
THE COMMISSIONAIRES WIFE WHO DID THE CHARING AND I GAVE HER THE
ORDER FOR THE COFFEE
I WROTE TWO MORE ARTICLES AND THEN FEELING MORE DROWSY THAN EVER I
ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM TO STRETCH MY LEGS MY COFFEE
HAD NOT YET COME AND I WONDERED WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DELAY
COULD BE OPENING THE DOOR I STARTED DOWN THE CORRIDOR TO FIND OUT
THERE WAS A STRAIGHT PASSAGE DIMLY LIGHTED WHICH LED FROM THE ROOM
IN WHICH I HAD BEEN WORKING AND WAS THE ONLY EXIT FROM IT IT ENDED
IN A CURVING STAIRCASE WITH THE COMMISSIONAIRES LODGE IN THE
PASSAGE AT THE BOTTOM HALF WAY DOWN THIS STAIRCASE IS A SMALL
LANDING WITH ANOTHER PASSAGE RUNNING INTO IT AT RIGHT ANGLES THIS
SECOND ONE LEADS BY MEANS OF A SECOND SMALL STAIR TO A SIDE DOOR
USED BY SERVANTS AND ALSO AS A SHORT CUT BY CLERKS WHEN COMING FROM
CHARLES STREET HERE IS A ROUGH CHART OF THE PLACE
THANK YOU I THINK THAT I QUITE FOLLOW YOU SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
IT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT YOU SHOULD NOTICE THIS POINT I
WENT DOWN THE STAIRS AND INTO THE HALL WHERE I FOUND THE
COMMISSIONAIRE FAST ASLEEP IN HIS BOX WITH THE KETTLE BOILING
FURIOUSLY UPON THE SPIRITLAMP I TOOK OFF THE KETTLE AND BLEW OUT
THE LAMP FOR THE WATER WAS SPURTING OVER THE FLOOR THEN I PUT OUT
MY HAND AND WAS ABOUT TO SHAKE THE MAN WHO WAS STILL SLEEPING
SOUNDLY WHEN A BELL OVER HIS HEAD RANG LOUDLY AND HE WOKE WITH A
START
MR PHELPS SIR SAID HE LOOKING AT ME IN BEWILDERMENT
I CAME DOWN TO SEE IF MY COFFEE WAS READY
I WAS BOILING THE KETTLE WHEN I FELL ASLEEP SIR HE LOOKED AT ME
AND THEN UP AT THE STILL QUIVERING BELL WITH AN EVERGROWING
ASTONISHMENT UPON HIS FACE
IF YOU WAS HERE SIR THEN WHO RANG THE BELL HE ASKED
THE BELL I CRIED WHAT BELL IS IT
ITS THE BELL OF THE ROOM YOU WERE WORKING IN
A COLD HAND SEEMED TO CLOSE ROUND MY HEART SOME ONE THEN WAS IN
THAT ROOM WHERE MY PRECIOUS TREATY LAY UPON THE TABLE I RAN
FRANTICALLY UP THE STAIR AND ALONG THE PASSAGE THERE WAS NO ONE IN
THE CORRIDORS MR HOLMES THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE ROOM ALL WAS
EXACTLY AS I LEFT IT SAVE ONLY THAT THE PAPERS WHICH HAD BEEN
COMMITTED TO MY CARE HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE DESK ON WHICH THEY LAY
THE COPY WAS THERE AND THE ORIGINAL WAS GONE
HOLMES SAT UP IN HIS CHAIR AND RUBBED HIS HANDS I COULD SEE THAT THE
PROBLEM WAS ENTIRELY TO HIS HEART PRAY WHAT DID YOU DO THEN HE
MURMURED
I RECOGNIZED IN AN INSTANT THAT THE THIEF MUST HAVE COME UP THE
STAIRS FROM THE SIDE DOOR OF COURSE I MUST HAVE MET HIM IF HE HAD
COME THE OTHER WAY
YOU WERE SATISFIED THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONCEALED IN THE ROOM
ALL THE TIME OR IN THE CORRIDOR WHICH YOU HAVE JUST DESCRIBED AS
DIMLY LIGHTED
IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE A RAT COULD NOT CONCEAL HIMSELF EITHER
IN THE ROOM OR THE CORRIDOR THERE IS NO COVER AT ALL
THANK YOU PRAY PROCEED
THE COMMISSIONAIRE SEEING BY MY PALE FACE THAT SOMETHING WAS TO BE
FEARED HAD FOLLOWED ME UPSTAIRS NOW WE BOTH RUSHED ALONG THE
CORRIDOR AND DOWN THE STEEP STEPS WHICH LED TO CHARLES STREET THE
DOOR AT THE BOTTOM WAS CLOSED BUT UNLOCKED WE FLUNG IT OPEN AND
RUSHED OUT I CAN DISTINCTLY REMEMBER THAT AS WE DID SO THERE CAME
THREE CHIMES FROM A NEIGHBORING CLOCK IT WAS QUARTER TO TEN
THAT IS OF ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE SAID HOLMES MAKING A NOTE UPON HIS
SHIRTCUFF
THE NIGHT WAS VERY DARK AND A THIN WARM RAIN WAS FALLING THERE
WAS NO ONE IN CHARLES STREET BUT A GREAT TRAFFIC WAS GOING ON AS
USUAL IN WHITEHALL AT THE EXTREMITY WE RUSHED ALONG THE PAVEMENT
BAREHEADED AS WE WERE AND AT THE FAR CORNER WE FOUND A POLICEMAN
STANDING
A ROBBERY HAS BEEN COMMITTED I GASPED A DOCUMENT OF IMMENSE
VALUE HAS BEEN STOLEN FROM THE FOREIGN OFFICE HAS ANY ONE PASSED
THIS WAY
I HAVE BEEN STANDING HERE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SIR SAID HE
ONLY ONE PERSON HAS PASSED DURING THAT TIMEA WOMAN TALL AND
ELDERLY WITH A PAISLEY SHAWL
AH THAT IS ONLY MY WIFE CRIED THE COMMISSIONAIRE HAS NO ONE
ELSE PASSED
NO ONE
THEN IT MUST BE THE OTHER WAY THAT THE THIEF TOOK CRIED THE
FELLOW TUGGING AT MY SLEEVE
BUT I WAS NOT SATISFIED AND THE ATTEMPTS WHICH HE MADE TO DRAW ME
AWAY INCREASED MY SUSPICIONS
WHICH WAY DID THE WOMAN GO I CRIED
I DONT KNOW SIR I NOTICED HER PASS BUT I HAD NO SPECIAL REASON
FOR WATCHING HER SHE SEEMED TO BE IN A HURRY
HOW LONG AGO WAS IT
OH NOT VERY MANY MINUTES
WITHIN THE LAST FIVE
WELL IT COULD NOT BE MORE THAN FIVE
YOURE ONLY WASTING YOUR TIME SIR AND EVERY MINUTE NOW IS OF
IMPORTANCE CRIED THE COMMISSIONAIRE TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THAT MY
OLD WOMAN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND COME DOWN TO THE OTHER END
OF THE STREET WELL IF YOU WONT I WILL AND WITH THAT HE RUSHED
OFF IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
BUT I WAS AFTER HIM IN AN INSTANT AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE SLEEVE
WHERE DO YOU LIVE SAID I
IVY LANE BRIXTON HE ANSWERED BUT DONT LET YOURSELF BE
DRAWN AWAY UPON A FALSE SCENT MR PHELPS COME TO THE OTHER END OF
THE STREET AND LET US SEE IF WE CAN HEAR OF ANYTHING
NOTHING WAS TO BE LOST BY FOLLOWING HIS ADVICE WITH THE POLICEMAN
WE BOTH HURRIED DOWN BUT ONLY TO FIND THE STREET FULL OF TRAFFIC
MANY PEOPLE COMING AND GOING BUT ALL ONLY TOO EAGER TO GET TO A
PLACE OF SAFETY UPON SO WET A NIGHT THERE WAS NO LOUNGER WHO COULD
TELL US WHO HAD PASSED
THEN WE RETURNED TO THE OFFICE AND SEARCHED THE STAIRS AND THE
PASSAGE WITHOUT RESULT THE CORRIDOR WHICH LED TO THE ROOM WAS LAID
DOWN WITH A KIND OF CREAMY LINOLEUM WHICH SHOWS AN IMPRESSION VERY
EASILY WE EXAMINED IT VERY CAREFULLY BUT FOUND NO OUTLINE OF ANY
FOOTMARK
HAD IT BEEN RAINING ALL EVENING
SINCE ABOUT SEVEN
HOW IS IT THEN THAT THE WOMAN WHO CAME INTO THE ROOM ABOUT NINE
LEFT NO TRACES WITH HER MUDDY BOOTS
I AM GLAD YOU RAISED THE POINT IT OCCURRED TO ME AT THE TIME THE
CHARWOMEN ARE IN THE HABIT OF TAKING OFF THEIR BOOTS AT THE
COMMISSIONAIRES OFFICE AND PUTTING ON LIST SLIPPERS
THAT IS VERY CLEAR THERE WERE NO MARKS THEN THOUGH THE NIGHT WAS
A WET ONE THE CHAIN OF EVENTS IS CERTAINLY ONE OF EXTRAORDINARY
INTEREST WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT
WE EXAMINED THE ROOM ALSO THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF A SECRET DOOR
AND THE WINDOWS ARE QUITE THIRTY FEET FROM THE GROUND BOTH OF THEM
WERE FASTENED ON THE INSIDE THE CARPET PREVENTS ANY POSSIBILITY OF A
TRAPDOOR AND THE CEILING IS OF THE ORDINARY WHITEWASHED KIND I
WILL PLEDGE MY LIFE THAT WHOEVER STOLE MY PAPERS COULD ONLY HAVE COME
THROUGH THE DOOR
HOW ABOUT THE FIREPLACE
THEY USE NONE THERE IS A STOVE THE BELLROPE HANGS FROM THE WIRE
JUST TO THE RIGHT OF MY DESK WHOEVER RANG IT MUST HAVE COME RIGHT UP
TO THE DESK TO DO IT BUT WHY SHOULD ANY CRIMINAL WISH TO RING THE
BELL IT IS A MOST INSOLUBLE MYSTERY
CERTAINLY THE INCIDENT WAS UNUSUAL WHAT WERE YOUR NEXT STEPS YOU
EXAMINED THE ROOM I PRESUME TO SEE IF THE INTRUDER HAD LEFT ANY
TRACESANY CIGAREND OR DROPPED GLOVE OR HAIRPIN OR OTHER TRIFLE
THERE WAS NOTHING OF THE SORT
NO SMELL
WELL WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT
AH A SCENT OF TOBACCO WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH A GREAT DEAL TO US IN
SUCH AN INVESTIGATION
I NEVER SMOKE MYSELF SO I THINK I SHOULD HAVE OBSERVED IT IF THERE
HAD BEEN ANY SMELL OF TOBACCO THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE OF ANY
KIND THE ONLY TANGIBLE FACT WAS THAT THE COMMISSIONAIRES WIFEMRS
TANGEY WAS THE NAMEHAD HURRIED OUT OF THE PLACE HE COULD GIVE NO
EXPLANATION SAVE THAT IT WAS ABOUT THE TIME WHEN THE WOMAN ALWAYS
WENT HOME THE POLICEMAN AND I AGREED THAT OUR BEST PLAN WOULD BE TO
SEIZE THE WOMAN BEFORE SHE COULD GET RID OF THE PAPERS PRESUMING
THAT SHE HAD THEM
THE ALARM HAD REACHED SCOTLAND YARD BY THIS TIME AND MR FORBES
THE DETECTIVE CAME ROUND AT ONCE AND TOOK UP THE CASE WITH A GREAT
DEAL OF ENERGY WE HIRED A HANSOM AND IN HALF AN HOUR WE WERE AT THE
ADDRESS WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN TO US A YOUNG WOMAN OPENED THE DOOR
WHO PROVED TO BE MRS TANGEYS ELDEST DAUGHTER HER MOTHER HAD NOT
COME BACK YET AND WE WERE SHOWN INTO THE FRONT ROOM TO WAIT
ABOUT TEN MINUTES LATER A KNOCK CAME AT THE DOOR AND HERE WE MADE
THE ONE SERIOUS MISTAKE FOR WHICH I BLAME MYSELF INSTEAD OF OPENING
THE DOOR OURSELVES WE ALLOWED THE GIRL TO DO SO WE HEARD HER SAY
MOTHER THERE ARE TWO MEN IN THE HOUSE WAITING TO SEE YOU AND AN
INSTANT AFTERWARDS WE HEARD THE PATTER OF FEET RUSHING DOWN THE
PASSAGE FORBES FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND WE BOTH RAN INTO THE BACK
ROOM OR KITCHEN BUT THE WOMAN HAD GOT THERE BEFORE US SHE STARED AT
US WITH DEFIANT EYES AND THEN SUDDENLY RECOGNIZING ME AN
EXPRESSION OF ABSOLUTE ASTONISHMENT CAME OVER HER FACE
WHY IF IT ISNT MR PHELPS OF THE OFFICE SHE CRIED
COME COME WHO DID YOU THINK WE WERE WHEN YOU RAN AWAY FROM US
ASKED MY COMPANION
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE BROKERS SAID SHE WE HAVE HAD SOME
TROUBLE WITH A TRADESMAN
THATS NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH ANSWERED FORBES WE HAVE REASON TO
BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN A PAPER OF IMPORTANCE FROM THE FOREIGN
OFFICE AND THAT YOU RAN IN HERE TO DISPOSE OF IT YOU MUST COME BACK
WITH US TO SCOTLAND YARD TO BE SEARCHED
IT WAS IN VAIN THAT SHE PROTESTED AND RESISTED A FOURWHEELER WAS
BROUGHT AND WE ALL THREE DROVE BACK IN IT WE HAD FIRST MADE AN
EXAMINATION OF THE KITCHEN AND ESPECIALLY OF THE KITCHEN FIRE TO
SEE WHETHER SHE MIGHT HAVE MADE AWAY WITH THE PAPERS DURING THE
INSTANT THAT SHE WAS ALONE THERE WERE NO SIGNS HOWEVER OF ANY
ASHES OR SCRAPS WHEN WE REACHED SCOTLAND YARD SHE WAS HANDED OVER AT
ONCE TO THE FEMALE SEARCHER I WAITED IN AN AGONY OF SUSPENSE UNTIL
SHE CAME BACK WITH HER REPORT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF THE PAPERS
THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THE HORROR OF MY SITUATION CAME IN ITS FULL
FORCE HITHERTO I HAD BEEN ACTING AND ACTION HAD NUMBED THOUGHT I
HAD BEEN SO CONFIDENT OF REGAINING THE TREATY AT ONCE THAT I HAD NOT
DARED TO THINK OF WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE IF I FAILED TO DO SO
BUT NOW THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE DONE AND I HAD LEISURE TO
REALIZE MY POSITION IT WAS HORRIBLE WATSON THERE WOULD TELL YOU
THAT I WAS A NERVOUS SENSITIVE BOY AT SCHOOL IT IS MY NATURE I
THOUGHT OF MY UNCLE AND OF HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE CABINET OF THE
SHAME WHICH I HAD BROUGHT UPON HIM UPON MYSELF UPON EVERY ONE
CONNECTED WITH ME WHAT THOUGH I WAS THE VICTIM OF AN EXTRAORDINARY
ACCIDENT NO ALLOWANCE IS MADE FOR ACCIDENTS WHERE DIPLOMATIC
INTERESTS ARE AT STAKE I WAS RUINED SHAMEFULLY HOPELESSLY RUINED
I DONT KNOW WHAT I DID I FANCY I MUST HAVE MADE A SCENE I HAVE A
DIM RECOLLECTION OF A GROUP OF OFFICIALS WHO CROWDED ROUND ME
ENDEAVORING TO SOOTHE ME ONE OF THEM DROVE DOWN WITH ME TO WATERLOO
AND SAW ME INTO THE WOKING TRAIN I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD HAVE COME
ALL THE WAY HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT DR FERRIER WHO LIVES NEAR ME WAS
GOING DOWN BY THAT VERY TRAIN THE DOCTOR MOST KINDLY TOOK CHARGE OF
ME AND IT WAS WELL HE DID SO FOR I HAD A FIT IN THE STATION AND
BEFORE WE REACHED HOME I WAS PRACTICALLY A RAVING MANIAC
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE STATE OF THINGS HERE WHEN THEY WERE ROUSED FROM
THEIR BEDS BY THE DOCTORS RINGING AND FOUND ME IN THIS CONDITION
POOR ANNIE HERE AND MY MOTHER WERE BROKENHEARTED DR FERRIER HAD
JUST HEARD ENOUGH FROM THE DETECTIVE AT THE STATION TO BE ABLE TO
GIVE AN IDEA OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND HIS STORY DID NOT MEND
MATTERS IT WAS EVIDENT TO ALL THAT I WAS IN FOR A LONG ILLNESS SO
JOSEPH WAS BUNDLED OUT OF THIS CHEERY BEDROOM AND IT WAS TURNED INTO
A SICKROOM FOR ME HERE I HAVE LAIN MR HOLMES FOR OVER NINE
WEEKS UNCONSCIOUS AND RAVING WITH BRAINFEVER IF IT HAD NOT BEEN
FOR MISS HARRISON HERE AND FOR THE DOCTORS CARE I SHOULD NOT BE
SPEAKING TO YOU NOW SHE HAS NURSED ME BY DAY AND A HIRED NURSE HAS
LOOKED AFTER ME BY NIGHT FOR IN MY MAD FITS I WAS CAPABLE OF
ANYTHING SLOWLY MY REASON HAS CLEARED BUT IT IS ONLY DURING THE
LAST THREE DAYS THAT MY MEMORY HAS QUITE RETURNED SOMETIMES I WISH
THAT IT NEVER HAD THE FIRST THING THAT I DID WAS TO WIRE TO MR
FORBES WHO HAD THE CASE IN HAND HE CAME OUT AND ASSURES ME THAT
THOUGH EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DONE NO TRACE OF A CLUE HAS BEEN
DISCOVERED THE COMMISSIONAIRE AND HIS WIFE HAVE BEEN EXAMINED IN
EVERY WAY WITHOUT ANY LIGHT BEING THROWN UPON THE MATTER THE
SUSPICIONS OF THE POLICE THEN RESTED UPON YOUNG GOROT WHO AS YOU
MAY REMEMBER STAYED OVER TIME IN THE OFFICE THAT NIGHT HIS
REMAINING BEHIND AND HIS FRENCH NAME WERE REALLY THE ONLY TWO POINTS
WHICH COULD SUGGEST SUSPICION BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT I DID NOT
BEGIN WORK UNTIL HE HAD GONE AND HIS PEOPLE ARE OF HUGUENOT
EXTRACTION BUT AS ENGLISH IN SYMPATHY AND TRADITION AS YOU AND I
ARE NOTHING WAS FOUND TO IMPLICATE HIM IN ANY WAY AND THERE THE
MATTER DROPPED I TURN TO YOU MR HOLMES AS ABSOLUTELY MY LAST
HOPE IF YOU FAIL ME THEN MY HONOR AS WELL AS MY POSITION ARE
FOREVER FORFEITED
THE INVALID SANK BACK UPON HIS CUSHIONS TIRED OUT BY THIS LONG
RECITAL WHILE HIS NURSE POURED HIM OUT A GLASS OF SOME STIMULATING
MEDICINE HOLMES SAT SILENTLY WITH HIS HEAD THROWN BACK AND HIS EYES
CLOSED IN AN ATTITUDE WHICH MIGHT SEEM LISTLESS TO A STRANGER BUT
WHICH I KNEW BETOKENED THE MOST INTENSE SELFABSORPTION
YOU STATEMENT HAS BEEN SO EXPLICIT SAID HE AT LAST THAT YOU HAVE
REALLY LEFT ME VERY FEW QUESTIONS TO ASK THERE IS ONE OF THE VERY
UTMOST IMPORTANCE HOWEVER DID YOU TELL ANY ONE THAT YOU HAD THIS
SPECIAL TASK TO PERFORM
NO ONE
NOT MISS HARRISON HERE FOR EXAMPLE
NO I HAD NOT BEEN BACK TO WOKING BETWEEN GETTING THE ORDER AND
EXECUTING THE COMMISSION
AND NONE OF YOUR PEOPLE HAD BY CHANCE BEEN TO SEE YOU
NONE
DID ANY OF THEM KNOW THEIR WAY ABOUT IN THE OFFICE
OH YES ALL OF THEM HAD BEEN SHOWN OVER IT
STILL OF COURSE IF YOU SAID NOTHING TO ANY ONE ABOUT THE TREATY
THESE INQUIRIES ARE IRRELEVANT
I SAID NOTHING
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF THE COMMISSIONAIRE
NOTHING EXCEPT THAT HE IS AN OLD SOLDIER
WHAT REGIMENT
OH I HAVE HEARDCOLDSTREAM GUARDS
THANK YOU I HAVE NO DOUBT I CAN GET DETAILS FROM FORBES THE
AUTHORITIES ARE EXCELLENT AT AMASSING FACTS THOUGH THEY DO NOT
ALWAYS USE THEM TO ADVANTAGE WHAT A LOVELY THING A ROSE IS
HE WALKED PAST THE COUCH TO THE OPEN WINDOW AND HELD UP THE DROOPING
STALK OF A MOSSROSE LOOKING DOWN AT THE DAINTY BLEND OF CRIMSON AND
GREEN IT WAS A NEW PHASE OF HIS CHARACTER TO ME FOR I HAD NEVER
BEFORE SEEN HIM SHOW ANY KEEN INTEREST IN NATURAL OBJECTS
THERE IS NOTHING IN WHICH DEDUCTION IS SO NECESSARY AS IN RELIGION
SAID HE LEANING WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE SHUTTERS IT CAN BE BUILT
UP AS AN EXACT SCIENCE BY THE REASONER OUR HIGHEST ASSURANCE OF THE
GOODNESS OF PROVIDENCE SEEMS TO ME TO REST IN THE FLOWERS ALL OTHER
THINGS OUR POWERS OUR DESIRES OUR FOOD ARE ALL REALLY NECESSARY
FOR OUR EXISTENCE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BUT THIS ROSE IS AN EXTRA
ITS SMELL AND ITS COLOR ARE AN EMBELLISHMENT OF LIFE NOT A CONDITION
OF IT IT IS ONLY GOODNESS WHICH GIVES EXTRAS AND SO I SAY AGAIN
THAT WE HAVE MUCH TO HOPE FROM THE FLOWERS
PERCY PHELPS AND HIS NURSE LOOKED AT HOLMES DURING THIS DEMONSTRATION
WITH SURPRISE AND A GOOD DEAL OF DISAPPOINTMENT WRITTEN UPON THEIR
FACES HE HAD FALLEN INTO A REVERIE WITH THE MOSSROSE BETWEEN HIS
FINGERS IT HAD LASTED SOME MINUTES BEFORE THE YOUNG LADY BROKE IN
UPON IT
DO YOU SEE ANY PROSPECT OF SOLVING THIS MYSTERY MR HOLMES SHE
ASKED WITH A TOUCH OF ASPERITY IN HER VOICE
OH THE MYSTERY HE ANSWERED COMING BACK WITH A START TO THE
REALITIES OF LIFE WELL IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO DENY THAT THE CASE IS
A VERY ABSTRUSE AND COMPLICATED ONE BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT I
WILL LOOK INTO THE MATTER AND LET YOU KNOW ANY POINTS WHICH MAY
STRIKE ME
DO YOU SEE ANY CLUE
YOU HAVE FURNISHED ME WITH SEVEN BUT OF COURSE I MUST TEST THEM
BEFORE I CAN PRONOUNCE UPON THEIR VALUE
YOU SUSPECT SOME ONE
I SUSPECT MYSELF
WHAT
OF COMING TO CONCLUSIONS TOO RAPIDLY
THEN GO TO LONDON AND TEST YOUR CONCLUSIONS
YOUR ADVICE IS VERY EXCELLENT MISS HARRISON SAID HOLMES RISING
I THINK WATSON WE CANNOT DO BETTER DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO
INDULGE IN FALSE HOPES MR PHELPS THE AFFAIR IS A VERY TANGLED
ONE
I SHALL BE IN A FEVER UNTIL I SEE YOU AGAIN CRIED THE DIPLOMATIST
WELL ILL COME OUT BY THE SAME TRAIN TOMORROW THOUGH ITS MORE
THAN LIKELY THAT MY REPORT WILL BE A NEGATIVE ONE
GOD BLESS YOU FOR PROMISING TO COME CRIED OUR CLIENT IT GIVES ME
FRESH LIFE TO KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS BEING DONE BY THE WAY I HAVE
HAD A LETTER FROM LORD HOLDHURST
HA WHAT DID HE SAY
HE WAS COLD BUT NOT HARSH I DARE SAY MY SEVERE ILLNESS PREVENTED
HIM FROM BEING THAT HE REPEATED THAT THE MATTER WAS OF THE UTMOST
IMPORTANCE AND ADDED THAT NO STEPS WOULD BE TAKEN ABOUT MY
FUTUREBY WHICH HE MEANS OF COURSE MY DISMISSALUNTIL MY HEALTH
WAS RESTORED AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF REPAIRING MY MISFORTUNE
WELL THAT WAS REASONABLE AND CONSIDERATE SAID HOLMES COME
WATSON FOR WE HAVE A GOOD DAYS WORK BEFORE US IN TOWN
MR JOSEPH HARRISON DROVE US DOWN TO THE STATION AND WE WERE SOON
WHIRLING UP IN A PORTSMOUTH TRAIN HOLMES WAS SUNK IN PROFOUND
THOUGHT AND HARDLY OPENED HIS MOUTH UNTIL WE HAD PASSED CLAPHAM
JUNCTION
ITS A VERY CHEERY THING TO COME INTO LONDON BY ANY OF THESE LINES
WHICH RUN HIGH AND ALLOW YOU TO LOOK DOWN UPON THE HOUSES LIKE
THIS
I THOUGHT HE WAS JOKING FOR THE VIEW WAS SORDID ENOUGH BUT HE SOON
EXPLAINED HIMSELF
LOOK AT THOSE BIG ISOLATED CLUMPS OF BUILDING RISING UP ABOVE THE
SLATES LIKE BRICK ISLANDS IN A LEADCOLORED SEA
THE BOARDSCHOOLS
LIGHTHOUSES MY BOY BEACONS OF THE FUTURE CAPSULES WITH HUNDREDS
OF BRIGHT LITTLE SEEDS IN EACH OUT OF WHICH WILL SPRING THE WISE
BETTER ENGLAND OF THE FUTURE I SUPPOSE THAT MAN PHELPS DOES NOT
DRINK
I SHOULD NOT THINK SO
NOR SHOULD I BUT WE ARE BOUND TO TAKE EVERY POSSIBILITY INTO
ACCOUNT THE POOR DEVIL HAS CERTAINLY GOT HIMSELF INTO VERY DEEP
WATER AND ITS A QUESTION WHETHER WE SHALL EVER BE ABLE TO GET HIM
ASHORE WHAT DID YOU THINK OF MISS HARRISON
A GIRL OF STRONG CHARACTER
YES BUT SHE IS A GOOD SORT OR I AM MISTAKEN SHE AND HER BROTHER
ARE THE ONLY CHILDREN OF AN IRONMASTER SOMEWHERE UP NORTHUMBERLAND
WAY HE GOT ENGAGED TO HER WHEN TRAVELING LAST WINTER AND SHE CAME
DOWN TO BE INTRODUCED TO HIS PEOPLE WITH HER BROTHER AS ESCORT THEN
CAME THE SMASH AND SHE STAYED ON TO NURSE HER LOVER WHILE BROTHER
JOSEPH FINDING HIMSELF PRETTY SNUG STAYED ON TOO IVE BEEN MAKING
A FEW INDEPENDENT INQUIRIES YOU SEE BUT TODAY MUST BE A DAY OF
INQUIRIES
MY PRACTICE I BEGAN
OH IF YOU FIND YOUR OWN CASES MORE INTERESTING THAN MINE SAID
HOLMES WITH SOME ASPERITY
I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT MY PRACTICE COULD GET ALONG VERY WELL FOR A
DAY OR TWO SINCE IT IS THE SLACKEST TIME IN THE YEAR
EXCELLENT SAID HE RECOVERING HIS GOODHUMOR THEN WELL LOOK
INTO THIS MATTER TOGETHER I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BEGIN BY SEEING
FORBES HE CAN PROBABLY TELL US ALL THE DETAILS WE WANT UNTIL WE KNOW
FROM WHAT SIDE THE CASE IS TO BE APPROACHED
YOU SAID YOU HAD A CLUE
WELL WE HAVE SEVERAL BUT WE CAN ONLY TEST THEIR VALUE BY FURTHER
INQUIRY THE MOST DIFFICULT CRIME TO TRACK IS THE ONE WHICH IS
PURPOSELESS NOW THIS IS NOT PURPOSELESS WHO IS IT WHO PROFITS BY
IT THERE IS THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR THERE IS THE RUSSIAN THERE IS
WHOEVER MIGHT SELL IT TO EITHER OF THESE AND THERE IS LORD
HOLDHURST
LORD HOLDHURST
WELL IT IS JUST CONCEIVABLE THAT A STATESMAN MIGHT FIND HIMSELF IN
A POSITION WHERE HE WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE SUCH A DOCUMENT
ACCIDENTALLY DESTROYED
NOT A STATESMAN WITH THE HONORABLE RECORD OF LORD HOLDHURST
IT IS A POSSIBILITY AND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO DISREGARD IT WE SHALL
SEE THE NOBLE LORD TODAY AND FIND OUT IF HE CAN TELL US ANYTHING
MEANWHILE I HAVE ALREADY SET INQUIRIES ON FOOT
ALREADY
YES I SENT WIRES FROM WOKING STATION TO EVERY EVENING PAPER IN
LONDON THIS ADVERTISEMENT WILL APPEAR IN EACH OF THEM
HE HANDED OVER A SHEET TORN FROM A NOTEBOOK ON IT WAS SCRIBBLED IN
PENCIL
REWARD THE NUMBER OF THE CAB WHICH DROPPED A FARE AT OR ABOUT
THE DOOR OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE IN CHARLES STREET AT QUARTER TO TEN IN
THE EVENING OF MAY D APPLY B BAKER STREET
YOU ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE THIEF CAME IN A CAB
IF NOT THERE IS NO HARM DONE BUT IF MR PHELPS IS CORRECT IN
STATING THAT THERE IS NO HIDINGPLACE EITHER IN THE ROOM OR THE
CORRIDORS THEN THE PERSON MUST HAVE COME FROM OUTSIDE IF HE CAME
FROM OUTSIDE ON SO WET A NIGHT AND YET LEFT NO TRACE OF DAMP UPON
THE LINOLEUM WHICH WAS EXAMINED WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF HIS PASSING
THEN IT IS EXCEEDING PROBABLY THAT HE CAME IN A CAB YES I THINK
THAT WE MAY SAFELY DEDUCE A CAB
IT SOUNDS PLAUSIBLE
THAT IS ONE OF THE CLUES OF WHICH I SPOKE IT MAY LEAD US TO
SOMETHING AND THEN OF COURSE THERE IS THE BELLWHICH IS THE MOST
DISTINCTIVE FEATURE OF THE CASE WHY SHOULD THE BELL RING WAS IT THE
THIEF WHO DID IT OUT OF BRAVADO OR WAS IT SOME ONE WHO WAS WITH THE
THIEF WHO DID IT IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE CRIME OR WAS IT AN
ACCIDENT OR WAS IT HE SANK BACK INTO THE STATE OF INTENSE AND
SILENT THOUGHT FROM WHICH HE HAD EMERGED BUT IT SEEMED TO ME
ACCUSTOMED AS I WAS TO HIS EVERY MOOD THAT SOME NEW POSSIBILITY HAD
DAWNED SUDDENLY UPON HIM
IT WAS TWENTY PAST THREE WHEN WE REACHED OUR TERMINUS AND AFTER A
HASTY LUNCHEON AT THE BUFFET WE PUSHED ON AT ONCE TO SCOTLAND YARD
HOLMES HAD ALREADY WIRED TO FORBES AND WE FOUND HIM WAITING TO
RECEIVE USA SMALL FOXY MAN WITH A SHARP BUT BY NO MEANS AMIABLE
EXPRESSION HE WAS DECIDEDLY FRIGID IN HIS MANNER TO US ESPECIALLY
WHEN HE HEARD THE ERRAND UPON WHICH WE HAD COME
IVE HEARD OF YOUR METHODS BEFORE NOW MR HOLMES SAID HE TARTLY
YOU ARE READY ENOUGH TO USE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THE POLICE CAN
LAY AT YOUR DISPOSAL AND THEN YOU TRY TO FINISH THE CASE YOURSELF
AND BRING DISCREDIT ON THEM
ON THE CONTRARY SAID HOLMES OUT OF MY LAST FIFTYTHREE CASES MY
NAME HAS ONLY APPEARED IN FOUR AND THE POLICE HAVE HAD ALL THE
CREDIT IN FORTYNINE I DONT BLAME YOU FOR NOT KNOWING THIS FOR YOU
ARE YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED BUT IF YOU WISH TO GET ON IN YOUR NEW
DUTIES YOU WILL WORK WITH ME AND NOT AGAINST ME
ID BE VERY GLAD OF A HINT OR TWO SAID THE DETECTIVE CHANGING HIS
MANNER IVE CERTAINLY HAD NO CREDIT FROM THE CASE SO FAR
WHAT STEPS HAVE YOU TAKEN
TANGEY THE COMMISSIONAIRE HAS BEEN SHADOWED HE LEFT THE GUARDS
WITH A GOOD CHARACTER AND WE CAN FIND NOTHING AGAINST HIM HIS WIFE
IS A BAD LOT THOUGH I FANCY SHE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THIS THAN
APPEARS
HAVE YOU SHADOWED HER
WE HAVE SET ONE OF OUR WOMEN ON TO HER MRS TANGEY DRINKS AND OUR
WOMAN HAS BEEN WITH HER TWICE WHEN SHE WAS WELL ON BUT SHE COULD GET
NOTHING OUT OF HER
I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE HAD BROKERS IN THE HOUSE
YES BUT THEY WERE PAID OFF
WHERE DID THE MONEY COME FROM
THAT WAS ALL RIGHT HIS PENSION WAS DUE THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY
SIGN OF BEING IN FUNDS
WHAT EXPLANATION DID SHE GIVE OF HAVING ANSWERED THE BELL WHEN MR
PHELPS RANG FOR THE COFFEE
SHE SAID THAT HE HUSBAND WAS VERY TIRED AND SHE WISHED TO RELIEVE
HIM
WELL CERTAINLY THAT WOULD AGREE WITH HIS BEING FOUND A LITTLE LATER
ASLEEP IN HIS CHAIR THERE IS NOTHING AGAINST THEM THEN BUT THE
WOMANS CHARACTER DID YOU ASK HER WHY SHE HURRIED AWAY THAT NIGHT
HER HASTE ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE POLICE CONSTABLE
SHE WAS LATER THAN USUAL AND WANTED TO GET HOME
DID YOU POINT OUT TO HER THAT YOU AND MR PHELPS WHO STARTED AT
LEAST TWENTY MINUTES AFTER HE GOT HOME BEFORE HER
SHE EXPLAINS THAT BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BUS AND A HANSOM
DID SHE MAKE IT CLEAR WHY ON REACHING HER HOUSE SHE RAN INTO THE
BACK KITCHEN
BECAUSE SHE HAD THE MONEY THERE WITH WHICH TO PAY OFF THE BROKERS
SHE HAS AT LEAST AN ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING DID YOU ASK HER WHETHER
IN LEAVING SHE MET ANY ONE OR SAW ANY ONE LOITERING ABOUT CHARLES
STREET
SHE SAW NO ONE BUT THE CONSTABLE
WELL YOU SEEM TO HAVE CROSSEXAMINED HER PRETTY THOROUGHLY WHAT
ELSE HAVE YOU DONE
THE CLERK GOROT HAS BEEN SHADOWED ALL THESE NINE WEEKS BUT WITHOUT
RESULT WE CAN SHOW NOTHING AGAINST HIM
ANYTHING ELSE
WELL WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO GO UPONNO EVIDENCE OF ANY KIND
HAVE YOU FORMED A THEORY ABOUT HOW THAT BELL RANG
WELL I MUST CONFESS THAT IT BEATS ME IT WAS A COOL HAND WHOEVER
IT WAS TO GO AND GIVE THE ALARM LIKE THAT
YES IT WAS A QUEER THING TO DO MANY THANKS TO YOU FOR WHAT YOU
HAVE TOLD ME IF I CAN PUT THE MAN INTO YOUR HANDS YOU SHALL HEAR
FROM ME COME ALONG WATSON
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO NOW I ASKED AS WE LEFT THE OFFICE
WE ARE NOW GOING TO INTERVIEW LORD HOLDHURST THE CABINET MINISTER
AND FUTURE PREMIER OF ENGLAND
WE WERE FORTUNATE IN FINDING THAT LORD HOLDHURST WAS STILL IN HIS
CHAMBERS IN DOWNING STREET AND ON HOLMES SENDING IN HIS CARD WE WERE
INSTANTLY SHOWN UP THE STATESMAN RECEIVED US WITH THAT OLDFASHIONED
COURTESY FOR WHICH HE IS REMARKABLE AND SEATED US ON THE TWO
LUXURIANT LOUNGES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE STANDING ON THE
RUG BETWEEN US WITH HIS SLIGHT TALL FIGURE HIS SHARP FEATURES
THOUGHTFUL FACE AND CURLING HAIR PREMATURELY TINGED WITH GRAY HE
SEEMED TO REPRESENT THAT NOT TOO COMMON TYPE A NOBLEMAN WHO IS IN
TRUTH NOBLE
YOUR NAME IS VERY FAMILIAR TO ME MR HOLMES SAID HE SMILING
AND OF COURSE I CANNOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT OF THE OBJECT OF
YOUR VISIT THERE HAS ONLY BEEN ONE OCCURRENCE IN THESE OFFICES WHICH
COULD CALL FOR YOUR ATTENTION IN WHOSE INTEREST ARE YOU ACTING MAY
I ASK
IN THAT OF MR PERCY PHELPS ANSWERED HOLMES
AH MY UNFORTUNATE NEPHEW YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT OUR KINSHIP MAKES
IT THE MORE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SCREEN HIM IN ANY WAY I FEAR THAT
THE INCIDENT MUST HAVE A VERY PREJUDICIAL EFFECT UPON HIS CAREER
BUT IF THE DOCUMENT IS FOUND
AH THAT OF COURSE WOULD BE DIFFERENT
I HAD ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS WHICH I WISHED TO ASK YOU LORD
HOLDHURST
I SHALL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU ANY INFORMATION IN MY POWER
WAS IT IN THIS ROOM THAT YOU GAVE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS AS TO THE
COPYING OF THE DOCUMENT
IT WAS
THEN YOU COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN OVERHEARD
IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION
DID YOU EVER MENTION TO ANY ONE THAT IT WAS YOUR INTENTION TO GIVE
ANY ONE THE TREATY TO BE COPIED
NEVER
YOU ARE CERTAIN OF THAT
ABSOLUTELY
WELL SINCE YOU NEVER SAID SO AND MR PHELPS NEVER SAID SO AND
NOBODY ELSE KNEW ANYTHING OF THE MATTER THEN THE THIEFS PRESENCE IN
THE ROOM WAS PURELY ACCIDENTAL HE SAW HIS CHANCE AND HE TOOK IT
THE STATESMAN SMILED YOU TAKE ME OUT OF MY PROVINCE THERE SAID
HE
HOLMES CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT THERE IS ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT
POINT WHICH I WISH TO DISCUSS WITH YOU SAID HE YOU FEARED AS I
UNDERSTAND THAT VERY GRAVE RESULTS MIGHT FOLLOW FROM THE DETAILS OF
THIS TREATY BECOMING KNOWN
A SHADOW PASSED OVER THE EXPRESSIVE FACE OF THE STATESMAN VERY
GRAVE RESULTS INDEED
AND HAVE THEY OCCURRED
NOT YET
IF THE TREATY HAD REACHED LET US SAY THE FRENCH OR RUSSIAN FOREIGN
OFFICE YOU WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR OF IT
I SHOULD SAID LORD HOLDHURST WITH A WRY FACE
SINCE NEARLY TEN WEEKS HAVE ELAPSED THEN AND NOTHING HAS BEEN
HEARD IT IS NOT UNFAIR TO SUPPOSE THAT FOR SOME REASON THE TREATY
HAS NOT REACHED THEM
LORD HOLDHURST SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
WE CAN HARDLY SUPPOSE MR HOLMES THAT THE THIEF TOOK THE TREATY IN
ORDER TO FRAME IT AND HANG IT UP
PERHAPS HE IS WAITING FOR A BETTER PRICE
IF HE WAITS A LITTLE LONGER HE WILL GET NO PRICE AT ALL THE TREATY
WILL CEASE TO BE SECRET IN A FEW MONTHS
THAT IS MOST IMPORTANT SAID HOLMES OF COURSE IT IS A POSSIBLE
SUPPOSITION THAT THE THIEF HAS HAD A SUDDEN ILLNESS
AN ATTACK OF BRAINFEVER FOR EXAMPLE ASKED THE STATESMAN
FLASHING A SWIFT GLANCE AT HIM
I DID NOT SAY SO SAID HOLMES IMPERTURBABLY AND NOW LORD
HOLDHURST WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN UP TOO MUCH OF YOUR VALUABLE TIME
AND WE SHALL WISH YOU GOODDAY
EVERY SUCCESS TO YOUR INVESTIGATION BE THE CRIMINAL WHO IT MAY
ANSWERED THE NOBLEMAN AS HE BOWED US OUT THE DOOR
HES A FINE FELLOW SAID HOLMES AS WE CAME OUT INTO WHITEHALL
BUT HE HAS A STRUGGLE TO KEEP UP HIS POSITION HE IS FAR FROM RICH
AND HAS MANY CALLS YOU NOTICED OF COURSE THAT HIS BOOTS HAD BEEN
RESOLED NOW WATSON I WONT DETAIN YOU FROM YOUR LEGITIMATE WORK
ANY LONGER I SHALL DO NOTHING MORE TODAY UNLESS I HAVE AN ANSWER
TO MY CAB ADVERTISEMENT BUT I SHOULD BE EXTREMELY OBLIGED TO YOU IF
YOU WOULD COME DOWN WITH ME TO WOKING TOMORROW BY THE SAME TRAIN
WHICH WE TOOK YESTERDAY
I MET HIM ACCORDINGLY NEXT MORNING AND WE TRAVELED DOWN TO WOKING
TOGETHER HE HAD HAD NO ANSWER TO HIS ADVERTISEMENT HE SAID AND NO
FRESH LIGHT HAD BEEN THROWN UPON THE CASE HE HAD WHEN HE SO WILLED
IT THE UTTER IMMOBILITY OF COUNTENANCE OF A RED INDIAN AND I COULD
NOT GATHER FROM HIS APPEARANCE WHETHER HE WAS SATISFIED OR NOT WITH
THE POSITION OF THE CASE HIS CONVERSATION I REMEMBER WAS ABOUT THE
BERTILLON SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENTS AND HE EXPRESSED HIS ENTHUSIASTIC
ADMIRATION OF THE FRENCH SAVANT
WE FOUND OUR CLIENT STILL UNDER THE CHARGE OF HIS DEVOTED NURSE BUT
LOOKING CONSIDERABLY BETTER THAN BEFORE HE ROSE FROM THE SOFA AND
GREETED US WITHOUT DIFFICULTY WHEN WE ENTERED
ANY NEWS HE ASKED EAGERLY
MY REPORT AS I EXPECTED IS A NEGATIVE ONE SAID HOLMES I HAVE
SEEN FORBES AND I HAVE SEEN YOUR UNCLE AND I HAVE SET ONE OR TWO
TRAINS OF INQUIRY UPON FOOT WHICH MAY LEAD TO SOMETHING
YOU HAVE NOT LOST HEART THEN
BY NO MEANS
GOD BLESS YOU FOR SAYING THAT CRIED MISS HARRISON IF WE KEEP OUR
COURAGE AND OUR PATIENCE THE TRUTH MUST COME OUT
WE HAVE MORE TO TELL YOU THAN YOU HAVE FOR US SAID PHELPS
RESEATING HIMSELF UPON THE COUCH
I HOPED YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
YES WE HAVE HAD AN ADVENTURE DURING THE NIGHT AND ONE WHICH MIGHT
HAVE PROVED TO BE A SERIOUS ONE HIS EXPRESSION GREW VERY GRAVE AS
HE SPOKE AND A LOOK OF SOMETHING AKIN TO FEAR SPRANG UP IN HIS EYES
DO YOU KNOW SAID HE THAT I BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT I AM THE
UNCONSCIOUS CENTRE OF SOME MONSTROUS CONSPIRACY AND THAT MY LIFE IS
AIMED AT AS WELL AS MY HONOR
AH CRIED HOLMES
IT SOUNDS INCREDIBLE FOR I HAVE NOT AS FAR AS I KNOW AN ENEMY IN
THE WORLD YET FROM LAST NIGHTS EXPERIENCE I CAN COME TO NO OTHER
CONCLUSION
PRAY LET ME HEAR IT
YOU MUST KNOW THAT LAST NIGHT WAS THE VERY FIRST NIGHT THAT I HAVE
EVER SLEPT WITHOUT A NURSE IN THE ROOM I WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAT I
THOUGHT I COULD DISPENSE WITH ONE I HAD A NIGHTLIGHT BURNING
HOWEVER WELL ABOUT TWO IN THE MORNING I HAD SUNK INTO A LIGHT SLEEP
WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY AROUSED BY A SLIGHT NOISE IT WAS LIKE THE SOUND
WHICH A MOUSE MAKES WHEN IT IS GNAWING A PLANK AND I LAY LISTENING
TO IT FOR SOME TIME UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT MUST COME FROM THAT
CAUSE THEN IT GREW LOUDER AND SUDDENLY THERE CAME FROM THE WINDOW A
SHARP METALLIC SNICK I SAT UP IN AMAZEMENT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT
WHAT THE SOUNDS WERE NOW THE FIRST ONES HAD BEEN CAUSED BY SOME ONE
FORCING AN INSTRUMENT THROUGH THE SLIT BETWEEN THE SASHES AND THE
SECOND BY THE CATCH BEING PRESSED BACK
THERE WAS A PAUSE THEN FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES AS IF THE PERSON WERE
WAITING TO SEE WHETHER THE NOISE HAD AWAKENED ME THEN I HEARD A
GENTLE CREAKING AS THE WINDOW WAS VERY SLOWLY OPENED I COULD STAND
IT NO LONGER FOR MY NERVES ARE NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE I SPRANG
OUT OF BED AND FLUNG OPEN THE SHUTTERS A MAN WAS CROUCHING AT THE
WINDOW I COULD SEE LITTLE OF HIM FOR HE WAS GONE LIKE A FLASH HE
WAS WRAPPED IN SOME SORT OF CLOAK WHICH CAME ACROSS THE LOWER PART OF
HIS FACE ONE THING ONLY I AM SURE OF AND THAT IS THAT HE HAD SOME
WEAPON IN HIS HAND IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE A LONG KNIFE I DISTINCTLY
SAW THE GLEAM OF IT AS HE TURNED TO RUN
THIS IS MOST INTERESTING SAID HOLMES PRAY WHAT DID YOU DO THEN
I SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED HIM THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW IF I HAD BEEN
STRONGER AS IT WAS I RANG THE BELL AND ROUSED THE HOUSE IT TOOK ME
SOME LITTLE TIME FOR THE BELL RINGS IN THE KITCHEN AND THE SERVANTS
ALL SLEEP UPSTAIRS I SHOUTED HOWEVER AND THAT BROUGHT JOSEPH DOWN
AND HE ROUSED THE OTHERS JOSEPH AND THE GROOM FOUND MARKS ON THE BED
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW BUT THE WEATHER HAS BEEN SO DRY LATELY THAT THEY
FOUND IT HOPELESS TO FOLLOW THE TRAIL ACROSS THE GRASS THERES A
PLACE HOWEVER ON THE WOODEN FENCE WHICH SKIRTS THE ROAD WHICH SHOWS
SIGNS THEY TELL ME AS IF SOME ONE HAD GOT OVER AND HAD SNAPPED THE
TOP OF THE RAIL IN DOING SO I HAVE SAID NOTHING TO THE LOCAL POLICE
YET FOR I THOUGHT I HAD BEST HAVE YOUR OPINION FIRST
THIS TALE OF OUR CLIENTS APPEARED TO HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY EFFECT
UPON SHERLOCK HOLMES HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND PACED ABOUT THE ROOM
IN UNCONTROLLABLE EXCITEMENT
MISFORTUNES NEVER COME SINGLE SAID PHELPS SMILING THOUGH IT WAS
EVIDENT THAT HIS ADVENTURE HAD SOMEWHAT SHAKEN HIM
YOU HAVE CERTAINLY HAD YOUR SHARE SAID HOLMES DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD WALK ROUND THE HOUSE WITH ME
OH YES I SHOULD LIKE A LITTLE SUNSHINE JOSEPH WILL COME TOO
AND I ALSO SAID MISS HARRISON
I AM AFRAID NOT SAID HOLMES SHAKING HIS HEAD I THINK I MUST ASK
YOU TO REMAIN SITTING EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE
THE YOUNG LADY RESUMED HER SEAT WITH AN AIR OF DISPLEASURE HER
BROTHER HOWEVER HAD JOINED US AND WE SET OFF ALL FOUR TOGETHER WE
PASSED ROUND THE LAWN TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE YOUNG DIPLOMATISTS
WINDOW THERE WERE AS HE HAD SAID MARKS UPON THE BED BUT THEY WERE
HOPELESSLY BLURRED AND VAGUE HOLMES STOPPED OVER THEM FOR AN
INSTANT AND THEN ROSE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS
I DONT THINK ANY ONE COULD MAKE MUCH OF THIS SAID HE LET US GO
ROUND THE HOUSE AND SEE WHY THIS PARTICULAR ROOM WAS CHOSE BY THE
BURGLAR I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THOSE LARGER WINDOWS OF THE
DRAWINGROOM AND DININGROOM WOULD HAVE HAD MORE ATTRACTIONS FOR
HIM
THEY ARE MORE VISIBLE FROM THE ROAD SUGGESTED MR JOSEPH HARRISON
AH YES OF COURSE THERE IS A DOOR HERE WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE
ATTEMPTED WHAT IS IT FOR
IT IS THE SIDE ENTRANCE FOR TRADESPEOPLE OF COURSE IT IS LOCKED AT
NIGHT
HAVE YOU EVER HAD AN ALARM LIKE THIS BEFORE
NEVER SAID OUR CLIENT
DO YOU KEEP PLATE IN THE HOUSE OR ANYTHING TO ATTRACT BURGLARS
NOTHING OF VALUE
HOLMES STROLLED ROUND THE HOUSE WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND A
NEGLIGENT AIR WHICH WAS UNUSUAL WITH HIM
BY THE WAY SAID HE TO JOSEPH HARRISON YOU FOUND SOME PLACE I
UNDERSTAND WHERE THE FELLOW SCALED THE FENCE LET US HAVE A LOOK AT
THAT
THE PLUMP YOUNG MAN LED US TO A SPOT WHERE THE TOP OF ONE OF THE
WOODEN RAILS HAD BEEN CRACKED A SMALL FRAGMENT OF THE WOOD WAS
HANGING DOWN HOLMES PULLED IT OFF AND EXAMINED IT CRITICALLY
DO YOU THINK THAT WAS DONE LAST NIGHT IT LOOKS RATHER OLD DOES IT
NOT
WELL POSSIBLY SO
THERE ARE NO MARKS OF ANY ONE JUMPING DOWN UPON THE OTHER SIDE NO
I FANCY WE SHALL GET NO HELP HERE LET US GO BACK TO THE BEDROOM AND
TALK THE MATTER OVER
PERCY PHELPS WAS WALKING VERY SLOWLY LEANING UPON THE ARM OF HIS
FUTURE BROTHERINLAW HOLMES WALKED SWIFTLY ACROSS THE LAWN AND WE
WERE AT THE OPEN WINDOW OF THE BEDROOM LONG BEFORE THE OTHERS CAME
UP
MISS HARRISON SAID HOLMES SPEAKING WITH THE UTMOST INTENSITY OF
MANNER YOU MUST STAY WHERE YOU ARE ALL DAY LET NOTHING PREVENT YOU
FROM STAYING WHERE YOU ARE ALL DAY IT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH IT MR HOLMES SAID THE GIRL IN
ASTONISHMENT
WHEN YOU GO TO BED LOCK THE DOOR OF THIS ROOM ON THE OUTSIDE AND
KEEP THE KEY PROMISE TO DO THIS
BUT PERCY
HE WILL COME TO LONDON WITH US
AND AM I TO REMAIN HERE
IT IS FOR HIS SAKE YOU CAN SERVE HIM QUICK PROMISE
SHE GAVE A QUICK NOD OF ASSENT JUST AS THE OTHER TWO CAME UP
WHY DO YOU SIT MOPING THERE ANNIE CRIED HER BROTHER COME OUT
INTO THE SUNSHINE
NO THANK YOU JOSEPH I HAVE A SLIGHT HEADACHE AND THIS ROOM IS
DELICIOUSLY COOL AND SOOTHING
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE NOW MR HOLMES ASKED OUR CLIENT
WELL IN INVESTIGATING THIS MINOR AFFAIR WE MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT OF
OUR MAIN INQUIRY IT WOULD BE A VERY GREAT HELP TO ME IF YOU WOULD
COME UP TO LONDON WITH US
AT ONCE
WELL AS SOON AS YOU CONVENIENTLY CAN SAY IN AN HOUR
I FEEL QUITE STRONG ENOUGH IF I CAN REALLY BE OF ANY HELP
THE GREATEST POSSIBLE
PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO STAY THERE TONIGHT
I WAS JUST GOING TO PROPOSE IT
THEN IF MY FRIEND OF THE NIGHT COMES TO REVISIT ME HE WILL FIND
THE BIRD FLOWN WE ARE ALL IN YOUR HANDS MR HOLMES AND YOU MUST
TELL US EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE DONE PERHAPS YOU WOULD PREFER
THAT JOSEPH CAME WITH US SO AS TO LOOK AFTER ME
OH NO MY FRIEND WATSON IS A MEDICAL MAN YOU KNOW AND HELL LOOK
AFTER YOU WELL HAVE OUR LUNCH HERE IF YOU WILL PERMIT US AND THEN
WE SHALL ALL THREE SET OFF FOR TOWN TOGETHER
IT WAS ARRANGED AS HE SUGGESTED THOUGH MISS HARRISON EXCUSED HERSELF
FROM LEAVING THE BEDROOM IN ACCORDANCE WITH HOLMESS SUGGESTION
WHAT THE OBJECT OF MY FRIENDS MANOEUVRES WAS I COULD NOT CONCEIVE
UNLESS IT WERE TO KEEP THE LADY AWAY FROM PHELPS WHO REJOICED BY
HIS RETURNING HEALTH AND BY THE PROSPECT OF ACTION LUNCHED WITH US
IN THE DININGROOM HOLMES HAD STILL MORE STARTLING SURPRISE FOR US
HOWEVER FOR AFTER ACCOMPANYING US DOWN TO THE STATION AND SEEING US
INTO OUR CARRIAGE HE CALMLY ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD NO INTENTION OF
LEAVING WOKING
THERE ARE ONE OR TWO SMALL POINTS WHICH I SHOULD DESIRE TO CLEAR UP
BEFORE I GO SAID HE YOUR ABSENCE MR PHELPS WILL IN SOME WAYS
RATHER ASSIST ME WATSON WHEN YOU REACH LONDON YOU WOULD OBLIGE ME
BY DRIVING AT ONCE TO BAKER STREET WITH OUR FRIEND HERE AND
REMAINING WITH HIM UNTIL I SEE YOU AGAIN IT IS FORTUNATE THAT YOU
ARE OLD SCHOOLFELLOWS AS YOU MUST HAVE MUCH TO TALK OVER MR
PHELPS CAN HAVE THE SPARE BEDROOM TONIGHT AND I WILL BE WITH YOU IN
TIME FOR BREAKFAST FOR THERE IS A TRAIN WHICH WILL TAKE ME INTO
WATERLOO AT EIGHT
BUT HOW ABOUT OUR INVESTIGATION IN LONDON ASKED PHELPS RUEFULLY
WE CAN DO THAT TOMORROW I THINK THAT JUST AT PRESENT I CAN BE OF
MORE IMMEDIATE USE HERE
YOU MIGHT TELL THEM AT BRIARBRAE THAT I HOPE TO BE BACK TOMORROW
NIGHT CRIED PHELPS AS WE BEGAN TO MOVE FROM THE PLATFORM
I HARDLY EXPECT TO GO BACK TO BRIARBRAE ANSWERED HOLMES AND WAVED
HIS HAND TO US CHEERILY AS WE SHOT OUT FROM THE STATION
PHELPS AND I TALKED IT OVER ON OUR JOURNEY BUT NEITHER OF US COULD
DEVISE A SATISFACTORY REASON FOR THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT
I SUPPOSE HE WANTS TO FIND OUT SOME CLUE AS TO THE BURGLARY LAST
NIGHT IF A BURGLAR IT WAS FOR MYSELF I DONT BELIEVE IT WAS AN
ORDINARY THIEF
WHAT IS YOUR OWN IDEA THEN
UPON MY WORD YOU MAY PUT IT DOWN TO MY WEAK NERVES OR NOT BUT I
BELIEVE THERE IS SOME DEEP POLITICAL INTRIGUE GOING ON AROUND ME AND
THAT FOR SOME REASON THAT PASSES MY UNDERSTANDING MY LIFE IS AIMED AT
BY THE CONSPIRATORS IT SOUNDS HIGHFLOWN AND ABSURD BUT CONSIDER
THE FACTS WHY SHOULD A THIEF TRY TO BREAK IN AT A BEDROOM WINDOW
WHERE THERE COULD BE NO HOPE OF ANY PLUNDER AND WHY SHOULD HE COME
WITH A LONG KNIFE IN HIS HAND
YOU ARE SURE IT WAS NOT A HOUSEBREAKERS JIMMY
OH NO IT WAS A KNIFE I SAW THE FLASH OF THE BLADE QUITE
DISTINCTLY
BUT WHY ON EARTH SHOULD YOU BE PURSUED WITH SUCH ANIMOSITY
AH THAT IS THE QUESTION
WELL IF HOLMES TAKES THE SAME VIEW THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR HIS
ACTION WOULD IT NOT PRESUMING THAT YOUR THEORY IS CORRECT IF HE
CAN LAY HIS HANDS UPON THE MAN WHO THREATENED YOU LAST NIGHT HE WILL
HAVE GONE A LONG WAY TOWARDS FINDING WHO TOOK THE NAVAL TREATY IT IS
ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE TWO ENEMIES ONE OF WHOM ROBS YOU
WHILE THE OTHER THREATENS YOUR LIFE
BUT HOLMES SAID THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO BRIARBRAE
I HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR SOME TIME SAID I BUT I NEVER KNEW HIM DO
ANYTHING YET WITHOUT A VERY GOOD REASON AND WITH THAT OUR
CONVERSATION DRIFTED OFF ON TO OTHER TOPICS
BUT IT WAS A WEARY DAY FOR ME PHELPS WAS STILL WEAK AFTER HIS LONG
ILLNESS AND HIS MISFORTUNE MADE HIM QUERULOUS AND NERVOUS IN VAIN I
ENDEAVORED TO INTEREST HIM IN AFGHANISTAN IN INDIA IN SOCIAL
QUESTIONS IN ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT TAKE HIS MIND OUT OF THE GROOVE
HE WOULD ALWAYS COME BACK TO HIS LOST TREATY WONDERING GUESSING
SPECULATING AS TO WHAT HOLMES WAS DOING WHAT STEPS LORD HOLDHURST
WAS TAKING WHAT NEWS WE SHOULD HAVE IN THE MORNING AS THE EVENING
WORE ON HIS EXCITEMENT BECAME QUITE PAINFUL
YOU HAVE IMPLICIT FAITH IN HOLMES HE ASKED
I HAVE SEEN HIM DO SOME REMARKABLE THINGS
BUT HE NEVER BROUGHT LIGHT INTO ANYTHING QUITE SO DARK AS THIS
OH YES I HAVE KNOWN HIM SOLVE QUESTIONS WHICH PRESENTED FEWER
CLUES THAN YOURS
BUT NOT WHERE SUCH LARGE INTERESTS ARE AT STAKE
I DONT KNOW THAT TO MY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE HE HAS ACTED ON BEHALF OF
THREE OF THE REIGNING HOUSES OF EUROPE IN VERY VITAL MATTERS
BUT YOU KNOW HIM WELL WATSON HE IS SUCH AN INSCRUTABLE FELLOW THAT
I NEVER QUITE KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF HIM DO YOU THINK HE IS HOPEFUL
DO YOU THINK HE EXPECTS TO MAKE A SUCCESS OF IT
HE HAS SAID NOTHING
THAT IS A BAD SIGN
ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE NOTICED THAT WHEN HE IS OFF THE TRAIL HE
GENERALLY SAYS SO IT IS WHEN HE IS ON A SCENT AND IS NOT QUITE
ABSOLUTELY SURE YET THAT IT IS THE RIGHT ONE THAT HE IS MOST
TACITURN NOW MY DEAR FELLOW WE CANT HELP MATTERS BY MAKING
OURSELVES NERVOUS ABOUT THEM SO LET ME IMPLORE YOU TO GO TO BED AND
SO BE FRESH FOR WHATEVER MAY AWAIT US TOMORROW
I WAS ABLE AT LAST TO PERSUADE MY COMPANION TO TAKE MY ADVICE THOUGH
I KNEW FROM HIS EXCITED MANNER THAT THERE WAS NOT MUCH HOPE OF SLEEP
FOR HIM INDEED HIS MOOD WAS INFECTIOUS FOR I LAY TOSSING HALF THE
NIGHT MYSELF BROODING OVER THIS STRANGE PROBLEM AND INVENTING A
HUNDRED THEORIES EACH OF WHICH WAS MORE IMPOSSIBLE THAN THE LAST
WHY HAD HOLMES REMAINED AT WOKING WHY HAD HE ASKED MISS HARRISON TO
REMAIN IN THE SICKROOM ALL DAY WHY HAD HE BEEN SO CAREFUL NOT TO
INFORM THE PEOPLE AT BRIARBRAE THAT HE INTENDED TO REMAIN NEAR THEM
I CUDGELLED MY BRAINS UNTIL I FELL ASLEEP IN THE ENDEAVOR TO FIND
SOME EXPLANATION WHICH WOULD COVER ALL THESE FACTS
IT WAS SEVEN OCLOCK WHEN I AWOKE AND I SET OFF AT ONCE FOR PHELPSS
ROOM TO FIND HIM HAGGARD AND SPENT AFTER A SLEEPLESS NIGHT HIS
FIRST QUESTION WAS WHETHER HOLMES HAD ARRIVED YET
HELL BE HERE WHEN HE PROMISED SAID I AND NOT AN INSTANT SOONER
OR LATER
AND MY WORDS WERE TRUE FOR SHORTLY AFTER EIGHT A HANSOM DASHED UP TO
THE DOOR AND OUR FRIEND GOT OUT OF IT STANDING IN THE WINDOW WE SAW
THAT HIS LEFT HAND WAS SWATHED IN A BANDAGE AND THAT HIS FACE WAS
VERY GRIM AND PALE HE ENTERED THE HOUSE BUT IT WAS SOME LITTLE TIME
BEFORE HE CAME UPSTAIRS
HE LOOKS LIKE A BEATEN MAN CRIED PHELPS
I WAS FORCED TO CONFESS THAT HE WAS RIGHT AFTER ALL SAID I THE
CLUE OF THE MATTER LIES PROBABLY HERE IN TOWN
PHELPS GAVE A GROAN
I DONT KNOW HOW IT IS SAID HE BUT I HAD HOPED FOR SO MUCH FROM
HIS RETURN BUT SURELY HIS HAND WAS NOT TIED UP LIKE THAT YESTERDAY
WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER
YOU ARE NOT WOUNDED HOLMES I ASKED AS MY FRIEND ENTERED THE
ROOM
TUT IT IS ONLY A SCRATCH THROUGH MY OWN CLUMSINESS HE ANSWERED
NODDING HIS GOODMORNINGS TO US THIS CASE OF YOURS MR PHELPS IS
CERTAINLY ONE OF THE DARKEST WHICH I HAVE EVER INVESTIGATED
I FEARED THAT YOU WOULD FIND IT BEYOND YOU
IT HAS BEEN A MOST REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE
THAT BANDAGE TELLS OF ADVENTURES SAID I WONT YOU TELL US WHAT
HAS HAPPENED
AFTER BREAKFAST MY DEAR WATSON REMEMBER THAT I HAVE BREATHED
THIRTY MILES OF SURREY AIR THIS MORNING I SUPPOSE THAT THERE HAS
BEEN NO ANSWER FROM MY CABMAN ADVERTISEMENT WELL WELL WE CANNOT
EXPECT TO SCORE EVERY TIME
THE TABLE WAS ALL LAID AND JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO RING MRS HUDSON
ENTERED WITH THE TEA AND COFFEE A FEW MINUTES LATER SHE BROUGHT IN
THREE COVERS AND WE ALL DREW UP TO THE TABLE HOLMES RAVENOUS I
CURIOUS AND PHELPS IN THE GLOOMIEST STATE OF DEPRESSION
MRS HUDSON HAS RISEN TO THE OCCASION SAID HOLMES UNCOVERING A
DISH OF CURRIED CHICKEN HER CUISINE IS A LITTLE LIMITED BUT SHE
HAS AS GOOD AN IDEA OF BREAKFAST AS A SCOTCHWOMAN WHAT HAVE YOU
HERE WATSON
HAM AND EGGS I ANSWERED
GOOD WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE MR PHELPSCURRIED FOWL OR EGGS
OR WILL YOU HELP YOURSELF
THANK YOU I CAN EAT NOTHING SAID PHELPS
OH COME TRY THE DISH BEFORE YOU
THANK YOU I WOULD REALLY RATHER NOT
WELL THEN SAID HOLMES WITH A MISCHIEVOUS TWINKLE I SUPPOSE
THAT YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION TO HELPING ME
PHELPS RAISED THE COVER AND AS HE DID SO HE UTTERED A SCREAM AND
SAT THERE STARING WITH A FACE AS WHITE AS THE PLATE UPON WHICH HE
LOOKED ACROSS THE CENTRE OF IT WAS LYING A LITTLE CYLINDER OF
BLUEGRAY PAPER HE CAUGHT IT UP DEVOURED IT WITH HIS EYES AND THEN
DANCED MADLY ABOUT THE ROOM PASSING IT TO HIS BOSOM AND SHRIEKING
OUT IN HIS DELIGHT THEN HE FELL BACK INTO AN ARMCHAIR SO LIMP AND
EXHAUSTED WITH HIS OWN EMOTIONS THAT WE HAD TO POUR BRANDY DOWN HIS
THROAT TO KEEP HIM FROM FAINTING
THERE THERE SAID HOLMES SOOTHING PATTING HIM UPON THE SHOULDER
IT WAS TOO BAD TO SPRING IT ON YOU LIKE THIS BUT WATSON HERE WILL
TELL YOU THAT I NEVER CAN RESIST A TOUCH OF THE DRAMATIC
PHELPS SEIZED HIS HAND AND KISSED IT GOD BLESS YOU HE CRIED YOU
HAVE SAVED MY HONOR
WELL MY OWN WAS AT STAKE YOU KNOW SAID HOLMES I ASSURE YOU IT
IS JUST AS HATEFUL TO ME TO FAIL IN A CASE AS IT CAN BE TO YOU TO
BLUNDER OVER A COMMISSION
PHELPS THRUST AWAY THE PRECIOUS DOCUMENT INTO THE INNERMOST POCKET OF
HIS COAT
I HAVE NOT THE HEART TO INTERRUPT YOUR BREAKFAST ANY FURTHER AND
YET I AM DYING TO KNOW HOW YOU GOT IT AND WHERE IT WAS
SHERLOCK HOLMES SWALLOWED A CUP OF COFFEE AND TURNED HIS ATTENTION
TO THE HAM AND EGGS THEN HE ROSE LIT HIS PIPE AND SETTLED HIMSELF
DOWN INTO HIS CHAIR
ILL TELL YOU WHAT I DID FIRST AND HOW I CAME TO DO IT AFTERWARDS
SAID HE AFTER LEAVING YOU AT THE STATION I WENT FOR A CHARMING WALK
THROUGH SOME ADMIRABLE SURREY SCENERY TO A PRETTY LITTLE VILLAGE
CALLED RIPLEY WHERE I HAD MY TEA AT AN INN AND TOOK THE PRECAUTION
OF FILLING MY FLASK AND OF PUTTING A PAPER OF SANDWICHES IN MY
POCKET THERE I REMAINED UNTIL EVENING WHEN I SET OFF FOR WOKING
AGAIN AND FOUND MYSELF IN THE HIGHROAD OUTSIDE BRIARBRAE JUST AFTER
SUNSET
WELL I WAITED UNTIL THE ROAD WAS CLEARIT IS NEVER A VERY
FREQUENTED ONE AT ANY TIME I FANCYAND THEN I CLAMBERED OVER THE
FENCE INTO THE GROUNDS
SURELY THE GATE WAS OPEN EJACULATED PHELPS
YES BUT I HAVE A PECULIAR TASTE IN THESE MATTERS I CHOSE THE PLACE
WHERE THE THREE FIRTREES STAND AND BEHIND THEIR SCREEN I GOT OVER
WITHOUT THE LEAST CHANCE OF ANY ONE IN THE HOUSE BEING ABLE TO SEE
ME I CROUCHED DOWN AMONG THE BUSHES ON THE OTHER SIDE AND CRAWLED
FROM ONE TO THE OTHERWITNESS THE DISREPUTABLE STATE OF MY TROUSER
KNEESUNTIL I HAD REACHED THE CLUMP OF RHODODENDRONS JUST OPPOSITE
TO YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW THERE I SQUATTED DOWN AND AWAITED
DEVELOPMENTS
THE BLIND WAS NOT DOWN IN YOUR ROOM AND I COULD SEE MISS HARRISON
SITTING THERE READING BY THE TABLE IT WAS QUARTERPAST TEN WHEN SHE
CLOSED HER BOOK FASTENED THE SHUTTERS AND RETIRED
I HEARD HER SHUT THE DOOR AND FELT QUITE SURE THAT SHE HAD TURNED
THE KEY IN THE LOCK
THE KEY EJACULATED PHELPS
YES I HAD GIVEN MISS HARRISON INSTRUCTIONS TO LOCK THE DOOR ON THE
OUTSIDE AND TAKE THE KEY WITH HER WHEN SHE WENT TO BED SHE CARRIED
OUT EVERY ONE OF MY INJUNCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND CERTAINLY WITHOUT
HER COOPERATION YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THAT PAPER IN YOU COATPOCKET SHE
DEPARTED THEN AND THE LIGHTS WENT OUT AND I WAS LEFT SQUATTING IN
THE RHODODENDRONBUSH
THE NIGHT WAS FINE BUT STILL IT WAS A VERY WEARY VIGIL OF COURSE
IT HAS THE SORT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT IT THAT THE SPORTSMAN FEELS WHEN
HE LIES BESIDE THE WATERCOURSE AND WAITS FOR THE BIG GAME IT WAS
VERY LONG THOUGHALMOST AS LONG WATSON AS WHEN YOU AND I WAITED
IN THAT DEADLY ROOM WHEN WE LOOKED INTO THE LITTLE PROBLEM OF THE
SPECKLED BAND THERE WAS A CHURCHCLOCK DOWN AT WOKING WHICH STRUCK
THE QUARTERS AND I THOUGHT MORE THAN ONCE THAT IT HAD STOPPED AT
LAST HOWEVER ABOUT TWO IN THE MORNING I SUDDENLY HEARD THE GENTLE
SOUND OF A BOLT BEING PUSHED BACK AND THE CREAKING OF A KEY A MOMENT
LATER THE SERVANTS DOOR WAS OPENED AND MR JOSEPH HARRISON STEPPED
OUT INTO THE MOONLIGHT
JOSEPH EJACULATED PHELPS
HE WAS BAREHEADED BUT HE HAD A BLACK COAT THROWN OVER HIS SHOULDER
SO THAT HE COULD CONCEAL HIS FACE IN AN INSTANT IF THERE WERE ANY
ALARM HE WALKED ON TIPTOE UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE WALL AND WHEN HE
REACHED THE WINDOW HE WORKED A LONGBLADED KNIFE THROUGH THE SASH AND
PUSHED BACK THE CATCH THEN HE FLUNG OPEN THE WINDOW AND PUTTING HIS
KNIFE THROUGH THE CRACK IN THE SHUTTERS HE THRUST THE BAR UP AND
SWUNG THEM OPEN
FROM WHERE I LAY I HAD A PERFECT VIEW OF THE INSIDE OF THE ROOM AND
OF EVERY ONE OF HIS MOVEMENTS HE LIT THE TWO CANDLES WHICH STOOD
UPON THE MANTELPIECE AND THEN HE PROCEEDED TO TURN BACK THE CORNER
OF THE CARPET IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE DOOR PRESENTLY HE STOPPED
AND PICKED OUT A SQUARE PIECE OF BOARD SUCH AS IS USUALLY LEFT TO
ENABLE PLUMBERS TO GET AT THE JOINTS OF THE GASPIPES THIS ONE
COVERED AS A MATTER OF FACT THE T JOINT WHICH GIVES OFF THE PIPE
WHICH SUPPLIES THE KITCHEN UNDERNEATH OUT OF THIS HIDINGPLACE HE
DREW THAT LITTLE CYLINDER OF PAPER PUSHED DOWN THE BOARD REARRANGED
THE CARPET BLEW OUT THE CANDLES AND WALKED STRAIGHT INTO MY ARMS AS
I STOOD WAITING FOR HIM OUTSIDE THE WINDOW
WELL HE HAS RATHER MORE VICIOUSNESS THAN I GAVE HIM CREDIT FOR HAS
MASTER JOSEPH HE FLEW AT ME WITH HIS KNIFE AND I HAD TO GRASP HIM
TWICE AND GOT A CUT OVER THE KNUCKLES BEFORE I HAD THE UPPER HAND
OF HIM HE LOOKED MURDER OUT OF THE ONLY EYE HE COULD SEE WITH WHEN
WE HAD FINISHED BUT HE LISTENED TO REASON AND GAVE UP THE PAPERS
HAVING GOT THEM I LET MY MAN GO BUT I WIRED FULL PARTICULARS TO
FORBES THIS MORNING IF HE IS QUICK ENOUGH TO CATCH HIS BIRD WELL
AND GOOD BUT IF AS I SHREWDLY SUSPECT HE FINDS THE NEST EMPTY
BEFORE HE GETS THERE WHY ALL THE BETTER FOR THE GOVERNMENT I FANCY
THAT LORD HOLDHURST FOR ONE AND MR PERCY PHELPS FOR ANOTHER WOULD
VERY MUCH RATHER THAT THE AFFAIR NEVER GOT AS FAR AS A POLICECOURT
MY GOD GASPED OUR CLIENT DO YOU TELL ME THAT DURING THESE LONG
TEN WEEKS OF AGONY THE STOLEN PAPERS WERE WITHIN THE VERY ROOM WITH
ME ALL THE TIME
SO IT WAS
AND JOSEPH JOSEPH A VILLAIN AND A THIEF
HUM I AM AFRAID JOSEPHS CHARACTER IS A RATHER DEEPER AND MORE
DANGEROUS ONE THAN ONE MIGHT JUDGE FROM HIS APPEARANCE FROM WHAT I
HAVE HEARD FROM HIM THIS MORNING I GATHER THAT HE HAS LOST HEAVILY
IN DABBLING WITH STOCKS AND THAT HE IS READY TO DO ANYTHING ON EARTH
TO BETTER HIS FORTUNES BEING AN ABSOLUTELY SELFISH MAN WHEN A
CHANCE PRESENTED ITSELF HE DID NOT ALLOW EITHER HIS SISTERS
HAPPINESS OR YOUR REPUTATION TO HOLD HIS HAND
PERCY PHELPS SANK BACK IN HIS CHAIR MY HEAD WHIRLS SAID HE YOUR
WORDS HAVE DAZED ME
THE PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTY IN YOUR CASE REMARKED HOLMES IN HIS
DIDACTIC FASHION LAY IN THE FACT OF THERE BEING TOO MUCH EVIDENCE
WHAT WAS VITAL WAS OVERLAID AND HIDDEN BY WHAT WAS IRRELEVANT OF ALL
THE FACTS WHICH WERE PRESENTED TO US WE HAD TO PICK JUST THOSE WHICH
WE DEEMED TO BE ESSENTIAL AND THEN PIECE THEM TOGETHER IN THEIR
ORDER SO AS TO RECONSTRUCT THIS VERY REMARKABLE CHAIN OF EVENTS I
HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO SUSPECT JOSEPH FROM THE FACT THAT YOU HAD
INTENDED TO TRAVEL HOME WITH HIM THAT NIGHT AND THAT THEREFORE IT
WAS A LIKELY ENOUGH THING THAT HE SHOULD CALL FOR YOU KNOWING THE
FOREIGN OFFICE WELL UPON HIS WAY WHEN I HEARD THAT SOME ONE HAD
BEEN SO ANXIOUS TO GET INTO THE BEDROOM IN WHICH NO ONE BUT JOSEPH
COULD HAVE CONCEALED ANYTHINGYOU TOLD US IN YOUR NARRATIVE HOW YOU
HAD TURNED JOSEPH OUT WHEN YOU ARRIVED WITH THE DOCTORMY SUSPICIONS
ALL CHANGED TO CERTAINTIES ESPECIALLY AS THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE ON THE
FIRST NIGHT UPON WHICH THE NURSE WAS ABSENT SHOWING THAT THE
INTRUDER WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE WAYS OF THE HOUSE
HOW BLIND I HAVE BEEN
THE FACTS OF THE CASE AS FAR AS I HAVE WORKED THEM OUT ARE THESE
THIS JOSEPH HARRISON ENTERED THE OFFICE THROUGH THE CHARLES STREET
DOOR AND KNOWING HIS WAY HE WALKED STRAIGHT INTO YOUR ROOM THE
INSTANT AFTER YOU LEFT IT FINDING NO ONE THERE HE PROMPTLY RANG THE
BELL AND AT THE INSTANT THAT HE DID SO HIS EYES CAUGHT THE PAPER
UPON THE TABLE A GLANCE SHOWED HIM THAT CHANCE HAD PUT IN HIS WAY A
STATE DOCUMENT OF IMMENSE VALUE AND IN AN INSTANT HE HAD THRUST IT
INTO HIS POCKET AND WAS GONE A FEW MINUTES ELAPSED AS YOU REMEMBER
BEFORE THE SLEEPY COMMISSIONAIRE DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE BELL AND
THOSE WERE JUST ENOUGH TO GIVE THE THIEF TIME TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
HE MADE HIS WAY TO WOKING BY THE FIRST TRAIN AND HAVING EXAMINED
HIS BOOTY AND ASSURED HIMSELF THAT IT REALLY WAS OF IMMENSE VALUE HE
HAD CONCEALED IT IN WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A VERY SAFE PLACE WITH THE
INTENTION OF TAKING IT OUT AGAIN IN A DAY OR TWO AND CARRYING IT TO
THE FRENCH EMBASSY OR WHEREVER HE THOUGHT THAT A LONG PRICE WAS TO
BE HAD THEN CAME YOUR SUDDEN RETURN HE WITHOUT A MOMENTS WARNING
WAS BUNDLED OUT OF HIS ROOM AND FROM THAT TIME ONWARD THERE WERE
ALWAYS AT LEAST TWO OF YOU THERE TO PREVENT HIM FROM REGAINING HIS
TREASURE THE SITUATION TO HIM MUST HAVE BEEN A MADDENING ONE BUT AT
LAST HE THOUGHT HE SAW HIS CHANCE HE TRIED TO STEAL IN BUT WAS
BAFFLED BY YOUR WAKEFULNESS YOU REMEMBER THAT YOU DID NOT TAKE YOUR
USUAL DRAUGHT THAT NIGHT
I REMEMBER
I FANCY THAT HE HAD TAKEN STEPS TO MAKE THAT DRAUGHT EFFICACIOUS
AND THAT HE QUITE RELIED UPON YOUR BEING UNCONSCIOUS OF COURSE I
UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WOULD REPEAT THE ATTEMPT WHENEVER IT COULD BE DONE
WITH SAFETY YOUR LEAVING THE ROOM GAVE HIM THE CHANCE HE WANTED I
KEPT MISS HARRISON IN IT ALL DAY SO THAT HE MIGHT NOT ANTICIPATE US
THEN HAVING GIVEN HIM THE IDEA THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR I KEPT
GUARD AS I HAVE DESCRIBED I ALREADY KNEW THAT THE PAPERS WERE
PROBABLY IN THE ROOM BUT I HAD NO DESIRE TO RIP UP ALL THE PLANKING
AND SKIRTING IN SEARCH OF THEM I LET HIM TAKE THEM THEREFORE FROM
THE HIDINGPLACE AND SO SAVED MYSELF AN INFINITY OF TROUBLE IS
THERE ANY OTHER POINT WHICH I CAN MAKE CLEAR
WHY DID HE TRY THE WINDOW ON THE FIRST OCCASION I ASKED WHEN HE
MIGHT HAVE ENTERED BY THE DOOR
IN REACHING THE DOOR HE WOULD HAVE TO PASS SEVEN BEDROOMS ON THE
OTHER HAND HE COULD GET OUT ON TO THE LAWN WITH EASE ANYTHING
ELSE
YOU DO NOT THINK ASKED PHELPS THAT HE HAD ANY MURDEROUS
INTENTION THE KNIFE WAS ONLY MEANT AS A TOOL
IT MAY BE SO ANSWERED HOLMES SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS I CAN ONLY
SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT MR JOSEPH HARRISON IS A GENTLEMAN TO WHOSE
MERCY I SHOULD BE EXTREMELY UNWILLING TO TRUST
THE FINAL PROBLEM
IT IS WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT I TAKE UP MY PEN TO WRITE THESE THE
LAST WORDS IN WHICH I SHALL EVER RECORD THE SINGULAR GIFTS BY WHICH
MY FRIEND MR SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS DISTINGUISHED IN AN INCOHERENT
AND AS I DEEPLY FEEL AN ENTIRELY INADEQUATE FASHION I HAVE
ENDEAVORED TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF MY STRANGE EXPERIENCES IN HIS
COMPANY FROM THE CHANCE WHICH FIRST BROUGHT US TOGETHER AT THE PERIOD
OF THE STUDY IN SCARLET UP TO THE TIME OF HIS INTERFERENCE IN THE
MATTER OF THE NAVAL TREATYAN INTERFERENCE WHICH HAD THE
UNQUESTIONABLE EFFECT OF PREVENTING A SERIOUS INTERNATIONAL
COMPLICATION IT WAS MY INTENTION TO HAVE STOPPED THERE AND TO HAVE
SAID NOTHING OF THAT EVENT WHICH HAS CREATED A VOID IN MY LIFE WHICH
THE LAPSE OF TWO YEARS HAS DONE LITTLE TO FILL MY HAND HAS BEEN
FORCED HOWEVER BY THE RECENT LETTERS IN WHICH COLONEL JAMES
MORIARTY DEFENDS THE MEMORY OF HIS BROTHER AND I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT
TO LAY THE FACTS BEFORE THE PUBLIC EXACTLY AS THEY OCCURRED I ALONE
KNOW THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH OF THE MATTER AND I AM SATISFIED THAT THE
TIME HAS COME WHEN NO GOOD PURPOSE IS TO BE SERVED BY ITS
SUPPRESSION AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN ONLY THREE ACCOUNTS
IN THE PUBLIC PRESS THAT IN THE JOURNAL DE GENVE ON MAY TH THE REUTERS
DESPATCH IN THE ENGLISH PAPERS ON MAY TH AND FINALLY
THE RECENT LETTERS TO WHICH I HAVE ALLUDED OF THESE THE FIRST AND
SECOND WERE EXTREMELY CONDENSED WHILE THE LAST IS AS I SHALL NOW
SHOW AN ABSOLUTE PERVERSION OF THE FACTS IT LIES WITH ME TO TELL
FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT REALLY TOOK PLACE BETWEEN PROFESSOR MORIARTY
AND MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
IT MAY BE REMEMBERED THAT AFTER MY MARRIAGE AND MY SUBSEQUENT START
IN PRIVATE PRACTICE THE VERY INTIMATE RELATIONS WHICH HAD EXISTED
BETWEEN HOLMES AND MYSELF BECAME TO SOME EXTENT MODIFIED HE STILL
CAME TO ME FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN HE DESIRED A COMPANION IN HIS
INVESTIGATION BUT THESE OCCASIONS GREW MORE AND MORE SELDOM UNTIL I
FIND THAT IN THE YEAR THERE WERE ONLY THREE CASES OF WHICH I
RETAIN ANY RECORD DURING THE WINTER OF THAT YEAR AND THE EARLY
SPRING OF I SAW IN THE PAPERS THAT HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED BY THE
FRENCH GOVERNMENT UPON A MATTER OF SUPREME IMPORTANCE AND I RECEIVED
TWO NOTES FROM HOLMES DATED FROM NARBONNE AND FROM NIMES FROM WHICH
I GATHERED THAT HIS STAY IN FRANCE WAS LIKELY TO BE A LONG ONE IT
WAS WITH SOME SURPRISE THEREFORE THAT I SAW HIM WALK INTO MY
CONSULTINGROOM UPON THE EVENING OF APRIL TH IT STRUCK ME THAT HE
WAS LOOKING EVEN PALER AND THINNER THAN USUAL
YES I HAVE BEEN USING MYSELF UP RATHER TOO FREELY HE REMARKED IN
ANSWER TO MY LOOK RATHER THAN TO MY WORDS I HAVE BEEN A LITTLE
PRESSED OF LATE HAVE YOU ANY OBJECTION TO MY CLOSING YOUR
SHUTTERS
THE ONLY LIGHT IN THE ROOM CAME FROM THE LAMP UPON THE TABLE AT WHICH
I HAD BEEN READING HOLMES EDGED HIS WAY ROUND THE WALL AND FLINGING
THE SHUTTERS TOGETHER HE BOLTED THEM SECURELY
YOU ARE AFRAID OF SOMETHING I ASKED
WELL I AM
OF WHAT
OF AIRGUNS
MY DEAR HOLMES WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH WATSON TO UNDERSTAND THAT I
AM BY NO MEANS A NERVOUS MAN AT THE SAME TIME IT IS STUPIDITY
RATHER THAN COURAGE TO REFUSE TO RECOGNIZE DANGER WHEN IT IS CLOSE
UPON YOU MIGHT I TROUBLE YOU FOR A MATCH HE DREW IN THE SMOKE OF
HIS CIGARETTE AS IF THE SOOTHING INFLUENCE WAS GRATEFUL TO HIM
I MUST APOLOGIZE FOR CALLING SO LATE SAID HE AND I MUST FURTHER
BEG YOU TO BE SO UNCONVENTIONAL AS TO ALLOW ME TO LEAVE YOUR HOUSE
PRESENTLY BY SCRAMBLING OVER YOUR BACK GARDEN WALL
BUT WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN I ASKED
HE HELD OUT HIS HAND AND I SAW IN THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP THAT TWO OF
HIS KNUCKLES WERE BURST AND BLEEDING
IT IS NOT AN AIRY NOTHING YOU SEE SAID HE SMILING ON THE
CONTRARY IT IS SOLID ENOUGH FOR A MAN TO BREAK HIS HAND OVER IS
MRS WATSON IN
SHE IS AWAY UPON A VISIT
INDEED YOU ARE ALONE
QUITE
THEN IT MAKES IT THE EASIER FOR ME TO PROPOSE THAT YOU SHOULD COME
AWAY WITH ME FOR A WEEK TO THE CONTINENT
WHERE
OH ANYWHERE ITS ALL THE SAME TO ME
THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY STRANGE IN ALL THIS IT WAS NOT HOLMESS
NATURE TO TAKE AN AIMLESS HOLIDAY AND SOMETHING ABOUT HIS PALE WORN
FACE TOLD ME THAT HIS NERVES WERE AT THEIR HIGHEST TENSION HE SAW
THE QUESTION IN MY EYES AND PUTTING HIS FINGERTIPS TOGETHER AND
HIS ELBOWS UPON HIS KNEES HE EXPLAINED THE SITUATION
YOU HAVE PROBABLY NEVER HEARD OF PROFESSOR MORIARTY SAID HE
NEVER
AYE THERES THE GENIUS AND THE WONDER OF THE THING HE CRIED THE MAN
PERVADES LONDON AND NO ONE HAS HEARD OF HIM THATS WHAT
PUTS HIM ON A PINNACLE IN THE RECORDS OF CRIME I TELL YOU WATSON
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THAT IF I COULD BEAT THAT MAN IF I COULD FREE
SOCIETY OF HIM I SHOULD FEEL THAT MY OWN CAREER HAD REACHED ITS
SUMMIT AND I SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TURN TO SOME MORE PLACID LINE IN
LIFE BETWEEN OURSELVES THE RECENT CASES IN WHICH I HAVE BEEN OF
ASSISTANCE TO THE ROYAL FAMILY OF SCANDINAVIA AND TO THE FRENCH
REPUBLIC HAVE LEFT ME IN SUCH A POSITION THAT I COULD CONTINUE TO
LIVE IN THE QUIET FASHION WHICH IS MOST CONGENIAL TO ME AND TO
CONCENTRATE MY ATTENTION UPON MY CHEMICAL RESEARCHES BUT I COULD
NOT REST WATSON I COULD NOT SIT QUIET IN MY CHAIR IF I THOUGHT
THAT SUCH A MAN AS PROFESSOR MORIARTY WERE WALKING THE STREETS OF
LONDON UNCHALLENGED
WHAT HAS HE DONE THEN
HIS CAREER HAS BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY ONE HE IS A MAN OF GOOD BIRTH
AND EXCELLENT EDUCATION ENDOWED BY NATURE WITH A PHENOMENAL
MATHEMATICAL FACULTY AT THE AGE OF TWENTYONE HE WROTE A TREATISE
UPON THE BINOMIAL THEOREM WHICH HAS HAD A EUROPEAN VOGUE ON THE
STRENGTH OF IT HE WON THE MATHEMATICAL CHAIR AT ONE OF OUR SMALLER
UNIVERSITIES AND HAD TO ALL APPEARANCE A MOST BRILLIANT CAREER
BEFORE HIM BUT THE MAN HAD HEREDITARY TENDENCIES OF THE MOST
DIABOLICAL KIND A CRIMINAL STRAIN RAN IN HIS BLOOD WHICH INSTEAD
OF BEING MODIFIED WAS INCREASED AND RENDERED INFINITELY MORE
DANGEROUS BY HIS EXTRAORDINARY MENTAL POWERS DARK RUMORS GATHERED
ROUND HIM IN THE UNIVERSITY TOWN AND EVENTUALLY HE WAS COMPELLED TO
RESIGN HIS CHAIR AND TO COME DOWN TO LONDON WHERE HE SET UP AS AN
ARMY COACH SO MUCH IS KNOWN TO THE WORLD BUT WHAT I AM TELLING YOU
NOW IS WHAT I HAVE MYSELF DISCOVERED
AS YOU ARE AWARE WATSON THERE IS NO ONE WHO KNOWS THE HIGHER
CRIMINAL WORLD OF LONDON SO WELL AS I DO FOR YEARS PAST I HAVE
CONTINUALLY BEEN CONSCIOUS OF SOME POWER BEHIND THE MALEFACTOR SOME
DEEP ORGANIZING POWER WHICH FOREVER STANDS IN THE WAY OF THE LAW AND
THROWS ITS SHIELD OVER THE WRONGDOER AGAIN AND AGAIN IN CASES OF
THE MOST VARYING SORTSFORGERY CASES ROBBERIES MURDERSI HAVE
FELT THE PRESENCE OF THIS FORCE AND I HAVE DEDUCED ITS ACTION IN
MANY OF THOSE UNDISCOVERED CRIMES IN WHICH I HAVE NOT BEEN PERSONALLY
CONSULTED FOR YEARS I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO BREAK THROUGH THE VEIL
WHICH SHROUDED IT AND AT LAST THE TIME CAME WHEN I SEIZED MY THREAD
AND FOLLOWED IT UNTIL IT LED ME AFTER A THOUSAND CUNNING WINDINGS
TO EXPROFESSOR MORIARTY OF MATHEMATICAL CELEBRITY
HE IS THE NAPOLEON OF CRIME WATSON HE IS THE ORGANIZER OF HALF
THAT IS EVIL AND OF NEARLY ALL THAT IS UNDETECTED IN THIS GREAT CITY
HE IS A GENIUS A PHILOSOPHER AN ABSTRACT THINKER HE HAS A BRAIN
OF THE FIRST ORDER HE SITS MOTIONLESS LIKE A SPIDER IN THE CENTER
OF ITS WEB BUT THAT WEB HAS A THOUSAND RADIATIONS AND HE KNOWS WELL
EVERY QUIVER OF EACH OF THEM HE DOES LITTLE HIMSELF HE ONLY
PLANS BUT HIS AGENTS ARE NUMEROUS AND SPLENDIDLY ORGANIZED IS
THERE A CRIME TO BE DONE A PAPER TO BE ABSTRACTED WE WILL SAY A
HOUSE TO BE RIFLED A MAN TO BE REMOVEDTHE WORD IS PASSED TO THE
PROFESSOR THE MATTER IS ORGANIZED AND CARRIED OUT THE AGENT MAY BE
CAUGHT IN THAT CASE MONEY IS FOUND FOR HIS BAIL OR HIS DEFENCE BUT THE
CENTRAL POWER WHICH USES THE AGENT IS NEVER CAUGHTNEVER SO
MUCH AS SUSPECTED THIS WAS THE ORGANIZATION WHICH I DEDUCED
WATSON AND WHICH I DEVOTED MY WHOLE ENERGY TO EXPOSING AND BREAKING
UP
BUT THE PROFESSOR WAS FENCED ROUND WITH SAFEGUARDS SO CUNNINGLY
DEVISED THAT DO WHAT I WOULD IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO GET EVIDENCE
WHICH WOULD CONVICT IN A COURT OF LAW YOU KNOW MY POWERS MY DEAR
WATSON AND YET AT THE END OF THREE MONTHS I WAS FORCED TO CONFESS
THAT I HAD AT LAST MET AN ANTAGONIST WHO WAS MY INTELLECTUAL EQUAL MY
HORROR AT HIS CRIMES WAS LOST IN MY ADMIRATION AT HIS SKILL BUT
AT LAST HE MADE A TRIPONLY A LITTLE LITTLE TRIPBUT IT WAS MORE
THAN HE COULD AFFORD WHEN I WAS SO CLOSE UPON HIM I HAD MY CHANCE
AND STARTING FROM THAT POINT I HAVE WOVEN MY NET ROUND HIM UNTIL
NOW IT IS ALL READY TO CLOSE IN THREE DAYSTHAT IS TO SAY ON
MONDAY NEXTMATTERS WILL BE RIPE AND THE PROFESSOR WITH ALL THE
PRINCIPAL MEMBERS OF HIS GANG WILL BE IN THE HANDS OF THE POLICE THEN
WILL COME THE GREATEST CRIMINAL TRIAL OF THE CENTURY THE
CLEARING UP OF OVER FORTY MYSTERIES AND THE ROPE FOR ALL OF THEM
BUT IF WE MOVE AT ALL PREMATURELY YOU UNDERSTAND THEY MAY SLIP OUT
OF OUR HANDS EVEN AT THE LAST MOMENT
NOW IF I COULD HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF PROFESSOR
MORIARTY ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL BUT HE WAS TOO WILY FOR THAT HE SAW
EVERY STEP WHICH I TOOK TO DRAW MY TOILS ROUND HIM AGAIN AND
AGAIN HE STROVE TO BREAK AWAY BUT I AS OFTEN HEADED HIM OFF I TELL
YOU MY FRIEND THAT IF A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THAT SILENT CONTEST
COULD BE WRITTEN IT WOULD TAKE ITS PLACE AS THE MOST BRILLIANT BIT
OF THRUSTANDPARRY WORK IN THE HISTORY OF DETECTION NEVER HAVE I
RISEN TO SUCH A HEIGHT AND NEVER HAVE I BEEN SO HARD PRESSED BY AN
OPPONENT HE CUT DEEP AND YET I JUST UNDERCUT HIM THIS MORNING
THE LAST STEPS WERE TAKEN AND THREE DAYS ONLY WERE WANTED TO
COMPLETE THE BUSINESS I WAS SITTING IN MY ROOM THINKING THE MATTER
OVER WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND PROFESSOR MORIARTY STOOD BEFORE ME
MY NERVES ARE FAIRLY PROOF WATSON BUT I MUST CONFESS TO A START
WHEN I SAW THE VERY MAN WHO HAD BEEN SO MUCH IN MY THOUGHTS STANDING
THERE ON MY THRESHOLD HIS APPEARANCE WAS QUITE FAMILIAR TO ME HE
IS EXTREMELY TALL AND THIN HIS FOREHEAD DOMES OUT IN A WHITE CURVE
AND HIS TWO EYES ARE DEEPLY SUNKEN IN HIS HEAD HE IS CLEANSHAVEN
PALE AND ASCETICLOOKING RETAINING SOMETHING OF THE PROFESSOR IN
HIS FEATURES HIS SHOULDERS ARE ROUNDED FROM MUCH STUDY AND HIS
FACE PROTRUDES FORWARD AND IS FOREVER SLOWLY OSCILLATING FROM SIDE
TO SIDE IN A CURIOUSLY REPTILIAN FASHION HE PEERED AT ME WITH GREAT
CURIOSITY IN HIS PUCKERED EYES
YOU HAVE LESS FRONTAL DEVELOPMENT THAT I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED
SAID HE AT LAST IT IS A DANGEROUS HABIT TO FINGER LOADED FIREARMS
IN THE POCKET OF ONES DRESSINGGOWN
THE FACT IS THAT UPON HIS ENTRANCE I HAD INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED THE
EXTREME PERSONAL DANGER IN WHICH I LAY THE ONLY CONCEIVABLE ESCAPE
FOR HIM LAY IN SILENCING MY TONGUE IN AN INSTANT I HAD SLIPPED THE
REVOLVER FROM THE DRAWER INTO MY POCKET AND WAS COVERING HIM THROUGH
THE CLOTH AT HIS REMARK I DREW THE WEAPON OUT AND LAID IT COCKED
UPON THE TABLE HE STILL SMILED AND BLINKED BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT HIS EYES WHICH MADE ME FEEL VERY GLAD THAT I HAD IT THERE
YOU EVIDENTLY DONT KNOW ME SAID HE
ON THE CONTRARY I ANSWERED I THINK IT IS FAIRLY EVIDENT THAT I
DO PRAY TAKE A CHAIR I CAN SPARE YOU FIVE MINUTES IF YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY
ALL THAT I HAVE TO SAY HAS ALREADY CROSSED YOUR MIND SAID HE
THEN POSSIBLY MY ANSWER HAS CROSSED YOURS I REPLIED
YOU STAND FAST
ABSOLUTELY
HE CLAPPED HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET AND I RAISED THE PISTOL FROM
THE TABLE BUT HE MERELY DREW OUT A MEMORANDUMBOOK IN WHICH HE HAD
SCRIBBLED SOME DATES
YOU CROSSED MY PATH ON THE TH OF JANUARY SAID HE ON THE D
YOU INCOMMODED ME BY THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY I WAS SERIOUSLY
INCONVENIENCED BY YOU AT THE END OF MARCH I WAS ABSOLUTELY HAMPERED
IN MY PLANS AND NOW AT THE CLOSE OF APRIL I FIND MYSELF PLACED IN
SUCH A POSITION THROUGH YOUR CONTINUAL PERSECUTION THAT I AM IN
POSITIVE DANGER OF LOSING MY LIBERTY THE SITUATION IS BECOMING AN
IMPOSSIBLE ONE
HAVE YOU ANY SUGGESTION TO MAKE I ASKED
YOU MUST DROP IT MR HOLMES SAID HE SWAYING HIS FACE ABOUT YOU REALLY
MUST YOU KNOW
AFTER MONDAY SAID I
TUT TUT SAID HE I AM QUITE SURE THAT A MAN OF YOUR
INTELLIGENCE WILL SEE THAT THERE CAN BE BUT ONE OUTCOME TO THIS
AFFAIR IT IS NECESSARY THAT YOU SHOULD WITHDRAW YOU HAVE WORKED
THINGS IN SUCH A FASHION THAT WE HAVE ONLY ONE RESOURCE LEFT IT HAS
BEEN AN INTELLECTUAL TREAT TO ME TO SEE THE WAY IN WHICH YOU HAVE
GRAPPLED WITH THIS AFFAIR AND I SAY UNAFFECTEDLY THAT IT WOULD BE
A GRIEF TO ME TO BE FORCED TO TAKE ANY EXTREME MEASURE YOU SMILE
SIR BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT IT REALLY WOULD
DANGER IS PART OF MY TRADE I REMARKED
THAT IS NOT DANGER SAID HE IT IS INEVITABLE DESTRUCTION YOU
STAND IN THE WAY NOT MERELY OF AN INDIVIDUAL BUT OF A MIGHTY
ORGANIZATION THE FULL EXTENT OF WHICH YOU WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS
HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REALIZE YOU MUST STAND CLEAR MR HOLMES OR BE
TRODDEN UNDER FOOT
I AM AFRAID SAID I RISING THAT IN THE PLEASURE OF THIS
CONVERSATION I AM NEGLECTING BUSINESS OF IMPORTANCE WHICH AWAITS ME
ELSEWHERE
HE ROSE ALSO AND LOOKED AT ME IN SILENCE SHAKING HIS HEAD SADLY
WELL WELL SAID HE AT LAST IT SEEMS A PITY BUT I HAVE DONE
WHAT I COULD I KNOW EVERY MOVE OF YOUR GAME YOU CAN DO NOTHING
BEFORE MONDAY IT HAS BEEN A DUEL BETWEEN YOU AND ME MR HOLMES YOU HOPE
TO PLACE ME IN THE DOCK I TELL YOU THAT I WILL NEVER STAND
IN THE DOCK YOU HOPE TO BEAT ME I TELL YOU THAT YOU WILL NEVER
BEAT ME IF YOU ARE CLEVER ENOUGH TO BRING DESTRUCTION UPON ME REST
ASSURED THAT I SHALL DO AS MUCH TO YOU
YOU HAVE PAID ME SEVERAL COMPLIMENTS MR MORIARTY SAID I LET
ME PAY YOU ONE IN RETURN WHEN I SAY THAT IF I WERE ASSURED OF THE
FORMER EVENTUALITY I WOULD IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC
CHEERFULLY ACCEPT THE LATTER
I CAN PROMISE YOU THE ONE BUT NOT THE OTHER HE SNARLED AND SO
TURNED HIS ROUNDED BACK UPON ME AND WENT PEERING AND BLINKING OUT OF
THE ROOM
THAT WAS MY SINGULAR INTERVIEW WITH PROFESSOR MORIARTY I CONFESS
THAT IT LEFT AN UNPLEASANT EFFECT UPON MY MIND HIS SOFT PRECISE
FASHION OF SPEECH LEAVES A CONVICTION OF SINCERITY WHICH A MERE BULLY
COULD NOT PRODUCE OF COURSE YOU WILL SAY WHY NOT TAKE POLICE
PRECAUTIONS AGAINST HIM THE REASON IS THAT I AM WELL CONVINCED
THAT IT IS FROM HIS AGENTS THE BLOW WOULD FALL I HAVE THE BEST
PROOFS THAT IT WOULD BE SO
YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN ASSAULTED
MY DEAR WATSON PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS NOT A MAN WHO LETS THE GRASS
GROW UNDER HIS FEET I WENT OUT ABOUT MIDDAY TO TRANSACT SOME
BUSINESS IN OXFORD STREET AS I PASSED THE CORNER WHICH LEADS FROM
BENTINCK STREET ON TO THE WELBECK STREET CROSSING A TWOHORSE VAN
FURIOUSLY DRIVEN WHIZZED ROUND AND WAS ON ME LIKE A FLASH I SPRANG
FOR THE FOOTPATH AND SAVED MYSELF BY THE FRACTION OF A SECOND THE
VAN DASHED ROUND BY MARYLEBONE LANE AND WAS GONE IN AN INSTANT I
KEPT TO THE PAVEMENT AFTER THAT WATSON BUT AS I WALKED DOWN VERE
STREET A BRICK CAME DOWN FROM THE ROOF OF ONE OF THE HOUSES AND WAS
SHATTERED TO FRAGMENTS AT MY FEET I CALLED THE POLICE AND HAD THE
PLACE EXAMINED THERE WERE SLATES AND BRICKS PILED UP ON THE ROOF
PREPARATORY TO SOME REPAIRS AND THEY WOULD HAVE ME BELIEVE THAT THE
WIND HAD TOPPLED OVER ONE OF THESE OF COURSE I KNEW BETTER BUT I
COULD PROVE NOTHING I TOOK A CAB AFTER THAT AND REACHED MY
BROTHERS ROOMS IN PALL MALL WHERE I SPENT THE DAY NOW I HAVE COME
ROUND TO YOU AND ON MY WAY I WAS ATTACKED BY A ROUGH WITH A
BLUDGEON I KNOCKED HIM DOWN AND THE POLICE HAVE HIM IN CUSTODY
BUT I CAN TELL YOU WITH THE MOST ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE THAT NO POSSIBLE
CONNECTION WILL EVER BE TRACED BETWEEN THE GENTLEMAN UPON WHOSE FRONT
TEETH I HAVE BARKED MY KNUCKLES AND THE RETIRING MATHEMATICAL COACH
WHO IS I DARE SAY WORKING OUT PROBLEMS UPON A BLACKBOARD TEN MILES
AWAY YOU WILL NOT WONDER WATSON THAT MY FIRST ACT ON ENTERING
YOUR ROOMS WAS TO CLOSE YOUR SHUTTERS AND THAT I HAVE BEEN COMPELLED
TO ASK YOUR PERMISSION TO LEAVE THE HOUSE BY SOME LESS CONSPICUOUS
EXIT THAN THE FRONT DOOR
I HAD OFTEN ADMIRED MY FRIENDS COURAGE BUT NEVER MORE THAN NOW AS
HE SAT QUIETLY CHECKING OFF A SERIES OF INCIDENTS WHICH MUST HAVE
COMBINED TO MAKE UP A DAY OF HORROR
YOU WILL SPEND THE NIGHT HERE I SAID
NO MY FRIEND YOU MIGHT FIND ME A DANGEROUS GUEST I HAVE MY PLANS
LAID AND ALL WILL BE WELL MATTERS HAVE GONE SO FAR NOW THAT THEY
CAN MOVE WITHOUT MY HELP AS FAR AS THE ARREST GOES THOUGH MY
PRESENCE IS NECESSARY FOR A CONVICTION IT IS OBVIOUS THEREFORE
THAT I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN GET AWAY FOR THE FEW DAYS WHICH REMAIN
BEFORE THE POLICE ARE AT LIBERTY TO ACT IT WOULD BE A GREAT
PLEASURE TO ME THEREFORE IF YOU COULD COME ON TO THE CONTINENT WITH
ME
THE PRACTICE IS QUIET SAID I AND I HAVE AN ACCOMMODATING
NEIGHBOR I SHOULD BE GLAD TO COME
AND TO START TOMORROW MORNING
IF NECESSARY
OH YES IT IS MOST NECESSARY THEN THESE ARE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS AND
I BEG MY DEAR WATSON THAT YOU WILL OBEY THEM TO THE LETTER FOR YOU
ARE NOW PLAYING A DOUBLEHANDED GAME WITH ME AGAINST THE CLEVEREST
ROGUE AND THE MOST POWERFUL SYNDICATE OF CRIMINALS IN EUROPE NOW
LISTEN YOU WILL DISPATCH WHATEVER LUGGAGE YOU INTEND TO TAKE BY A
TRUSTY MESSENGER UNADDRESSED TO VICTORIA TONIGHT IN THE MORNING
YOU WILL SEND FOR A HANSOM DESIRING YOUR MAN TO TAKE NEITHER THE
FIRST NOR THE SECOND WHICH MAY PRESENT ITSELF INTO THIS HANSOM YOU
WILL JUMP AND YOU WILL DRIVE TO THE STRAND END OF THE LOWTHER
ARCADE HANDING THE ADDRESS TO THE CABMAN UPON A SLIP OF PAPER WITH
A REQUEST THAT HE WILL NOT THROW IT AWAY HAVE YOUR FARE READY AND
THE INSTANT THAT YOUR CAB STOPS DASH THROUGH THE ARCADE TIMING
YOURSELF TO REACH THE OTHER SIDE AT A QUARTERPAST NINE YOU WILL
FIND A SMALL BROUGHAM WAITING CLOSE TO THE CURB DRIVEN BY A FELLOW
WITH A HEAVY BLACK CLOAK TIPPED AT THE COLLAR WITH RED INTO THIS
YOU WILL STEP AND YOU WILL REACH VICTORIA IN TIME FOR THE
CONTINENTAL EXPRESS
WHERE SHALL I MEET YOU
AT THE STATION THE SECOND FIRSTCLASS CARRIAGE FROM THE FRONT WILL
BE RESERVED FOR US
THE CARRIAGE IS OUR RENDEZVOUS THEN
YES
IT WAS IN VAIN THAT I ASKED HOLMES TO REMAIN FOR THE EVENING IT WAS
EVIDENT TO ME THAT HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT BRING TROUBLE TO THE ROOF HE
WAS UNDER AND THAT THAT WAS THE MOTIVE WHICH IMPELLED HIM TO GO WITH A
FEW HURRIED WORDS AS TO OUR PLANS FOR THE MORROW HE ROSE AND
CAME OUT WITH ME INTO THE GARDEN CLAMBERING OVER THE WALL WHICH
LEADS INTO MORTIMER STREET AND IMMEDIATELY WHISTLING FOR A HANSOM
IN WHICH I HEARD HIM DRIVE AWAY
IN THE MORNING I OBEYED HOLMESS INJUNCTIONS TO THE LETTER A HANSOM
WAS PROCURED WITH SUCH PRECAUTION AS WOULD PREVENT ITS BEING ONE
WHICH WAS PLACED READY FOR US AND I DROVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER
BREAKFAST TO THE LOWTHER ARCADE THROUGH WHICH I HURRIED AT THE TOP
OF MY SPEED A BROUGHAM WAS WAITING WITH A VERY MASSIVE DRIVER
WRAPPED IN A DARK CLOAK WHO THE INSTANT THAT I HAD STEPPED IN
WHIPPED UP THE HORSE AND RATTLED OFF TO VICTORIA STATION ON MY
ALIGHTING THERE HE TURNED THE CARRIAGE AND DASHED AWAY AGAIN WITHOUT
SO MUCH AS A LOOK IN MY DIRECTION
SO FAR ALL HAD GONE ADMIRABLY MY LUGGAGE WAS WAITING FOR ME AND I
HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE CARRIAGE WHICH HOLMES HAD INDICATED
THE LESS SO AS IT WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE TRAIN WHICH WAS MARKED
ENGAGED MY ONLY SOURCE OF ANXIETY NOW WAS THE NONAPPEARANCE OF
HOLMES THE STATION CLOCK MARKED ONLY SEVEN MINUTES FROM THE TIME
WHEN WE WERE DUE TO START IN VAIN I SEARCHED AMONG THE GROUPS OF
TRAVELLERS AND LEAVETAKERS FOR THE LITHE FIGURE OF MY FRIEND THERE
WAS NO SIGN OF HIM I SPENT A FEW MINUTES IN ASSISTING A VENERABLE
ITALIAN PRIEST WHO WAS ENDEAVORING TO MAKE A PORTER UNDERSTAND IN
HIS BROKEN ENGLISH THAT HIS LUGGAGE WAS TO BE BOOKED THROUGH TO
PARIS THEN HAVING TAKEN ANOTHER LOOK ROUND I RETURNED TO MY
CARRIAGE WHERE I FOUND THAT THE PORTER IN SPITE OF THE TICKET HAD
GIVEN ME MY DECREPIT ITALIAN FRIEND AS A TRAVELING COMPANION IT WAS
USELESS FOR ME TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS AN INTRUSION
FOR MY ITALIAN WAS EVEN MORE LIMITED THAN HIS ENGLISH SO I SHRUGGED
MY SHOULDERS RESIGNEDLY AND CONTINUED TO LOOK OUT ANXIOUSLY FOR MY
FRIEND A CHILL OF FEAR HAD COME OVER ME AS I THOUGHT THAT HIS
ABSENCE MIGHT MEAN THAT SOME BLOW HAD FALLEN DURING THE NIGHT ALREADY
THE DOORS HAD ALL BEEN SHUT AND THE WHISTLE BLOWN WHEN
MY DEAR WATSON SAID A VOICE YOU HAVE NOT EVEN CONDESCENDED TO
SAY GOODMORNING
I TURNED IN UNCONTROLLABLE ASTONISHMENT THE AGED ECCLESIASTIC HAD
TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS ME FOR AN INSTANT THE WRINKLES WERE
SMOOTHED AWAY THE NOSE DREW AWAY FROM THE CHIN THE LOWER LIP CEASED
TO PROTRUDE AND THE MOUTH TO MUMBLE THE DULL EYES REGAINED THEIR
FIRE THE DROOPING FIGURE EXPANDED THE NEXT THE WHOLE FRAME
COLLAPSED AGAIN AND HOLMES HAD GONE AS QUICKLY AS HE HAD COME
GOOD HEAVENS I CRIED HOW YOU STARTLED ME
EVERY PRECAUTION IS STILL NECESSARY HE WHISPERED I HAVE REASON
TO THINK THAT THEY ARE HOT UPON OUR TRAIL AH THERE IS MORIARTY
HIMSELF
THE TRAIN HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO MOVE AS HOLMES SPOKE GLANCING BACK
I SAW A TALL MAN PUSHING HIS WAY FURIOUSLY THROUGH THE CROWD AND
WAVING HIS HAND AS IF HE DESIRED TO HAVE THE TRAIN STOPPED IT WAS
TOO LATE HOWEVER FOR WE WERE RAPIDLY GATHERING MOMENTUM AND AN
INSTANT LATER HAD SHOT CLEAR OF THE STATION
WITH ALL OUR PRECAUTIONS YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE CUT IT RATHER FINE
SAID HOLMES LAUGHING HE ROSE AND THROWING OFF THE BLACK CASSOCK
AND HAT WHICH HAD FORMED HIS DISGUISE HE PACKED THEM AWAY IN A
HANDBAG
HAVE YOU SEEN THE MORNING PAPER WATSON
NO
YOU HAVENT SEEN ABOUT BAKER STREET THEN
BAKER STREET
THEY SET FIRE TO OUR ROOMS LAST NIGHT NO GREAT HARM WAS DONE
GOOD HEAVENS HOLMES THIS IS INTOLERABLE
THEY MUST HAVE LOST MY TRACK COMPLETELY AFTER THEIR BLUDGEONMAN WAS
ARRESTED OTHERWISE THEY COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED THAT I HAD RETURNED
TO MY ROOMS THEY HAVE EVIDENTLY TAKEN THE PRECAUTION OF WATCHING
YOU HOWEVER AND THAT IS WHAT HAS BROUGHT MORIARTY TO VICTORIA YOU
COULD NOT HAVE MADE ANY SLIP IN COMING
I DID EXACTLY WHAT YOU ADVISED
DID YOU FIND YOUR BROUGHAM
YES IT WAS WAITING
DID YOU RECOGNIZE YOUR COACHMAN
NO
IT WAS MY BROTHER MYCROFT IT IS AN ADVANTAGE TO GET ABOUT IN SUCH
A CASE WITHOUT TAKING A MERCENARY INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE BUT WE MUST
PLAN WHAT WE ARE TO DO ABOUT MORIARTY NOW
AS THIS IS AN EXPRESS AND AS THE BOAT RUNS IN CONNECTION WITH IT I
SHOULD THINK WE HAVE SHAKEN HIM OFF VERY EFFECTIVELY
MY DEAR WATSON YOU EVIDENTLY DID NOT REALIZE MY MEANING WHEN I SAID
THAT THIS MAN MAY BE TAKEN AS BEING QUITE ON THE SAME INTELLECTUAL
PLANE AS MYSELF YOU DO NOT IMAGINE THAT IF I WERE THE PURSUER I
SHOULD ALLOW MYSELF TO BE BAFFLED BY SO SLIGHT AN OBSTACLE WHY
THEN SHOULD YOU THINK SO MEANLY OF HIM
WHAT WILL HE DO
WHAT I SHOULD DO
WHAT WOULD YOU DO THEN
ENGAGE A SPECIAL
BUT IT MUST BE LATE
BY NO MEANS THIS TRAIN STOPS AT CANTERBURY AND THERE IS ALWAYS AT
LEAST A QUARTER OF AN HOURS DELAY AT THE BOAT HE WILL CATCH US
THERE
ONE WOULD THINK THAT WE WERE THE CRIMINALS LET US HAVE HIM
ARRESTED ON HIS ARRIVAL
IT WOULD BE TO RUIN THE WORK OF THREE MONTHS WE SHOULD GET THE BIG
FISH BUT THE SMALLER WOULD DART RIGHT AND LEFT OUT OF THE NET ON
MONDAY WE SHOULD HAVE THEM ALL NO AN ARREST IS INADMISSIBLE
WHAT THEN
WE SHALL GET OUT AT CANTERBURY
AND THEN
WELL THEN WE MUST MAKE A CROSSCOUNTRY JOURNEY TO NEWHAVEN AND SO
OVER TO DIEPPE MORIARTY WILL AGAIN DO WHAT I SHOULD DO HE WILL
GET ON TO PARIS MARK DOWN OUR LUGGAGE AND WAIT FOR TWO DAYS AT THE
DEPOT IN THE MEANTIME WE SHALL TREAT OURSELVES TO A COUPLE OF
CARPETBAGS ENCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURES OF THE COUNTRIES THROUGH
WHICH WE TRAVEL AND MAKE OUR WAY AT OUR LEISURE INTO SWITZERLAND
VIA LUXEMBOURG AND BASLE
AT CANTERBURY THEREFORE WE ALIGHTED ONLY TO FIND THAT WE SHOULD
HAVE TO WAIT AN HOUR BEFORE WE COULD GET A TRAIN TO NEWHAVEN
I WAS STILL LOOKING RATHER RUEFULLY AFTER THE RAPIDLY DISAPPEARING
LUGGAGEVAN WHICH CONTAINED MY WARDROBE WHEN HOLMES PULLED MY SLEEVE
AND POINTED UP THE LINE
ALREADY YOU SEE SAID HE
FAR AWAY FROM AMONG THE KENTISH WOODS THERE ROSE A THIN SPRAY OF
SMOKE A MINUTE LATER A CARRIAGE AND ENGINE COULD BE SEEN FLYING
ALONG THE OPEN CURVE WHICH LEADS TO THE STATION WE HAD HARDLY TIME
TO TAKE OUR PLACE BEHIND A PILE OF LUGGAGE WHEN IT PASSED WITH A
RATTLE AND A ROAR BEATING A BLAST OF HOT AIR INTO OUR FACES
THERE HE GOES SAID HOLMES AS WE WATCHED THE CARRIAGE SWING AND
ROCK OVER THE POINT THERE ARE LIMITS YOU SEE TO OUR FRIENDS
INTELLIGENCE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A COUPDEMATRE HAD HE DEDUCED
WHAT I WOULD DEDUCE AND ACTED ACCORDINGLY
AND WHAT WOULD HE HAVE DONE HAD HE OVERTAKEN US
THERE CANNOT BE THE LEAST DOUBT THAT HE WOULD HAVE MADE A MURDEROUS
ATTACK UPON ME IT IS HOWEVER A GAME AT WHICH TWO MAY PLAY THE
QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER WE SHOULD TAKE A PREMATURE LUNCH HERE OR RUN
OUR CHANCE OF STARVING BEFORE WE REACH THE BUFFET AT NEWHAVEN
WE MADE OUR WAY TO BRUSSELS THAT NIGHT AND SPENT TWO DAYS THERE
MOVING ON UPON THE THIRD DAY AS FAR AS STRASBURG ON THE MONDAY
MORNING HOLMES HAD TELEGRAPHED TO THE LONDON POLICE AND IN THE
EVENING WE FOUND A REPLY WAITING FOR US AT OUR HOTEL HOLMES TORE IT
OPEN AND THEN WITH A BITTER CURSE HURLED IT INTO THE GRATE
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT HE GROANED HE HAS ESCAPED
MORIARTY
THEY HAVE SECURED THE WHOLE GANG WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIM HE HAS
GIVEN THEM THE SLIP OF COURSE WHEN I HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY THERE
WAS NO ONE TO COPE WITH HIM BUT I DID THINK THAT I HAD PUT THE GAME
IN THEIR HANDS I THINK THAT YOU HAD BETTER RETURN TO ENGLAND
WATSON
WHY
BECAUSE YOU WILL FIND ME A DANGEROUS COMPANION NOW THIS MANS
OCCUPATION IS GONE HE IS LOST IF HE RETURNS TO LONDON IF I READ
HIS CHARACTER RIGHT HE WILL DEVOTE HIS WHOLE ENERGIES TO REVENGING
HIMSELF UPON ME HE SAID AS MUCH IN OUR SHORT INTERVIEW AND I FANCY
THAT HE MEANT IT I SHOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND YOU TO RETURN TO YOUR
PRACTICE
IT WAS HARDLY AN APPEAL TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITH ONE WHO WAS AN OLD
CAMPAIGNER AS WELL AS AN OLD FRIEND WE SAT IN THE STRASBOURG
SALLE MANGER ARGUING THE QUESTION FOR HALF AN HOUR BUT THE SAME
NIGHT WE HAD RESUMED OUR JOURNEY AND WERE WELL ON OUR WAY TO GENEVA
FOR A CHARMING WEEK WE WANDERED UP THE VALLEY OF THE RHONE AND THEN
BRANCHING OFF AT LEUK WE MADE OUR WAY OVER THE GEMMI PASS STILL
DEEP IN SNOW AND SO BY WAY OF INTERLAKEN TO MEIRINGEN IT WAS A
LOVELY TRIP THE DAINTY GREEN OF THE SPRING BELOW THE VIRGIN WHITE
OF THE WINTER ABOVE BUT IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT NEVER FOR ONE
INSTANT DID HOLMES FORGET THE SHADOW WHICH LAY ACROSS HIM IN THE
HOMELY ALPINE VILLAGES OR IN THE LONELY MOUNTAIN PASSES I COULD TELL
BY HIS QUICK GLANCING EYES AND HIS SHARP SCRUTINY OF EVERY FACE THAT
PASSED US THAT HE WAS WELL CONVINCED THAT WALK WHERE WE WOULD WE
COULD NOT WALK OURSELVES CLEAR OF THE DANGER WHICH WAS DOGGING OUR
FOOTSTEPS
ONCE I REMEMBER AS WE PASSED OVER THE GEMMI AND WALKED ALONG THE
BORDER OF THE MELANCHOLY DAUBENSEE A LARGE ROCK WHICH HAD BEEN
DISLODGED FROM THE RIDGE UPON OUR RIGHT CLATTERED DOWN AND ROARED
INTO THE LAKE BEHIND US IN AN INSTANT HOLMES HAD RACED UP ON TO THE
RIDGE AND STANDING UPON A LOFTY PINNACLE CRANED HIS NECK IN EVERY
DIRECTION IT WAS IN VAIN THAT OUR GUIDE ASSURED HIM THAT A FALL OF
STONES WAS A COMMON CHANCE IN THE SPRINGTIME AT THAT SPOT HE SAID
NOTHING BUT HE SMILED AT ME WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO SEES THE
FULFILLMENT OF THAT WHICH HE HAD EXPECTED
AND YET FOR ALL HIS WATCHFULNESS HE WAS NEVER DEPRESSED ON THE
CONTRARY I CAN NEVER RECOLLECT HAVING SEEN HIM IN SUCH EXUBERANT
SPIRITS AGAIN AND AGAIN HE RECURRED TO THE FACT THAT IF HE COULD BE
ASSURED THAT SOCIETY WAS FREED FROM PROFESSOR MORIARTY HE WOULD
CHEERFULLY BRING HIS OWN CAREER TO A CONCLUSION
I THINK THAT I MAY GO SO FAR AS TO SAY WATSON THAT I HAVE NOT
LIVED WHOLLY IN VAIN HE REMARKED IF MY RECORD WERE CLOSED
TONIGHT I COULD STILL SURVEY IT WITH EQUANIMITY THE AIR OF LONDON
IS THE SWEETER FOR MY PRESENCE IN OVER A THOUSAND CASES I AM NOT
AWARE THAT I HAVE EVER USED MY POWERS UPON THE WRONG SIDE OF LATE I
HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO LOOK INTO THE PROBLEMS FURNISHED BY NATURE
RATHER THAN THOSE MORE SUPERFICIAL ONES FOR WHICH OUR ARTIFICIAL
STATE OF SOCIETY IS RESPONSIBLE YOUR MEMOIRS WILL DRAW TO AN END
WATSON UPON THE DAY THAT I CROWN MY CAREER BY THE CAPTURE OR
EXTINCTION OF THE MOST DANGEROUS AND CAPABLE CRIMINAL IN EUROPE
I SHALL BE BRIEF AND YET EXACT IN THE LITTLE WHICH REMAINS FOR ME
TO TELL IT IS NOT A SUBJECT ON WHICH I WOULD WILLINGLY DWELL AND
YET I AM CONSCIOUS THAT A DUTY DEVOLVES UPON ME TO OMIT NO DETAIL
IT WAS ON THE THIRD OF MAY THAT WE REACHED THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF
MEIRINGEN WHERE WE PUT UP AT THE ENGLISCHER HOF THEN KEPT BY PETER
STEILER THE ELDER OUR LANDLORD WAS AN INTELLIGENT MAN AND SPOKE
EXCELLENT ENGLISH HAVING SERVED FOR THREE YEARS AS WAITER AT THE
GROSVENOR HOTEL IN LONDON AT HIS ADVICE ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE
FOURTH WE SET OFF TOGETHER WITH THE INTENTION OF CROSSING THE HILLS
AND SPENDING THE NIGHT AT THE HAMLET OF ROSENLAUI WE HAD STRICT
INJUNCTIONS HOWEVER ON NO ACCOUNT TO PASS THE FALLS OF REICHENBACH
WHICH ARE ABOUT HALFWAY UP THE HILL WITHOUT MAKING A SMALL DETOUR
TO SEE THEM
IT IS INDEED A FEARFUL PLACE THE TORRENT SWOLLEN BY THE MELTING
SNOW PLUNGES INTO A TREMENDOUS ABYSS FROM WHICH THE SPRAY ROLLS UP
LIKE THE SMOKE FROM A BURNING HOUSE THE SHAFT INTO WHICH THE RIVER
HURLS ITSELF IS AN IMMENSE CHASM LINED BY GLISTENING COALBLACK
ROCK AND NARROWING INTO A CREAMING BOILING PIT OF INCALCULABLE
DEPTH WHICH BRIMS OVER AND SHOOTS THE STREAM ONWARD OVER ITS JAGGED
LIP THE LONG SWEEP OF GREEN WATER ROARING FOREVER DOWN AND THE
THICK FLICKERING CURTAIN OF SPRAY HISSING FOREVER UPWARD TURN A MAN
GIDDY WITH THEIR CONSTANT WHIRL AND CLAMOR WE STOOD NEAR THE EDGE
PEERING DOWN AT THE GLEAM OF THE BREAKING WATER FAR BELOW US AGAINST
THE BLACK ROCKS AND LISTENING TO THE HALFHUMAN SHOUT WHICH CAME
BOOMING UP WITH THE SPRAY OUT OF THE ABYSS
THE PATH HAS BEEN CUT HALFWAY ROUND THE FALL TO AFFORD A COMPLETE
VIEW BUT IT ENDS ABRUPTLY AND THE TRAVELER HAS TO RETURN AS HE
CAME WE HAD TURNED TO DO SO WHEN WE SAW A SWISS LAD COME RUNNING
ALONG IT WITH A LETTER IN HIS HAND IT BORE THE MARK OF THE HOTEL
WHICH WE HAD JUST LEFT AND WAS ADDRESSED TO ME BY THE LANDLORD IT
APPEARED THAT WITHIN A VERY FEW MINUTES OF OUR LEAVING AN ENGLISH
LADY HAD ARRIVED WHO WAS IN THE LAST STAGE OF CONSUMPTION SHE HAD
WINTERED AT DAVOS PLATZ AND WAS JOURNEYING NOW TO JOIN HER FRIENDS
AT LUCERNE WHEN A SUDDEN HEMORRHAGE HAD OVERTAKEN HER IT WAS
THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD HARDLY LIVE A FEW HOURS BUT IT WOULD BE A
GREAT CONSOLATION TO HER TO SEE AN ENGLISH DOCTOR AND IF I WOULD
ONLY RETURN ETC THE GOOD STEILER ASSURED ME IN A POSTSCRIPT THAT
HE WOULD HIMSELF LOOK UPON MY COMPLIANCE AS A VERY GREAT FAVOR SINCE
THE LADY ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO SEE A SWISS PHYSICIAN AND HE COULD
NOT BUT FEEL THAT HE WAS INCURRING A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY
THE APPEAL WAS ONE WHICH COULD NOT BE IGNORED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
REFUSE THE REQUEST OF A FELLOWCOUNTRYWOMAN DYING IN A STRANGE LAND YET
I HAD MY SCRUPLES ABOUT LEAVING HOLMES IT WAS FINALLY AGREED
HOWEVER THAT HE SHOULD RETAIN THE YOUNG SWISS MESSENGER WITH HIM AS
GUIDE AND COMPANION WHILE I RETURNED TO MEIRINGEN MY FRIEND WOULD
STAY SOME LITTLE TIME AT THE FALL HE SAID AND WOULD THEN WALK
SLOWLY OVER THE HILL TO ROSENLAUI WHERE I WAS TO REJOIN HIM IN THE
EVENING AS I TURNED AWAY I SAW HOLMES WITH HIS BACK AGAINST A ROCK
AND HIS ARMS FOLDED GAZING DOWN AT THE RUSH OF THE WATERS IT WAS
THE LAST THAT I WAS EVER DESTINED TO SEE OF HIM IN THIS WORLD
WHEN I WAS NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE DESCENT I LOOKED BACK IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE FROM THAT POSITION TO SEE THE FALL BUT I COULD SEE THE
CURVING PATH WHICH WINDS OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL AND LEADS TO
IT ALONG THIS A MAN WAS I REMEMBER WALKING VERY RAPIDLY
I COULD SEE HIS BLACK FIGURE CLEARLY OUTLINED AGAINST THE GREEN
BEHIND HIM I NOTED HIM AND THE ENERGY WITH WHICH HE WALKED BUT HE
PASSED FROM MY MIND AGAIN AS I HURRIED ON UPON MY ERRAND
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR BEFORE I REACHED MEIRINGEN OLD
STEILER WAS STANDING AT THE PORCH OF HIS HOTEL
WELL SAID I AS I CAME HURRYING UP I TRUST THAT SHE IS NO
WORSE
A LOOK OF SURPRISE PASSED OVER HIS FACE AND AT THE FIRST QUIVER OF
HIS EYEBROWS MY HEART TURNED TO LEAD IN MY BREAST
YOU DID NOT WRITE THIS I SAID PULLING THE LETTER FROM MY POCKET THERE
IS NO SICK ENGLISHWOMAN IN THE HOTEL
CERTAINLY NOT HE CRIED BUT IT HAS THE HOTEL MARK UPON IT HA
IT MUST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY THAT TALL ENGLISHMAN WHO CAME IN AFTER
YOU HAD GONE HE SAID
BUT I WAITED FOR NONE OF THE LANDLORDS EXPLANATIONS IN A TINGLE OF
FEAR I WAS ALREADY RUNNING DOWN THE VILLAGE STREET AND MAKING FOR
THE PATH WHICH I HAD SO LATELY DESCENDED IT HAD TAKEN ME AN HOUR TO
COME DOWN FOR ALL MY EFFORTS TWO MORE HAD PASSED BEFORE I FOUND
MYSELF AT THE FALL OF REICHENBACH ONCE MORE THERE WAS HOLMESS
ALPINESTOCK STILL LEANING AGAINST THE ROCK BY WHICH I HAD LEFT HIM BUT
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIM AND IT WAS IN VAIN THAT I SHOUTED MY
ONLY ANSWER WAS MY OWN VOICE REVERBERATING IN A ROLLING ECHO FROM THE
CLIFFS AROUND ME
IT WAS THE SIGHT OF THAT ALPINESTOCK WHICH TURNED ME COLD AND SICK HE
HAD NOT GONE TO ROSENLAUI THEN HE HAD REMAINED ON THAT
THREEFOOT PATH WITH SHEER WALL ON ONE SIDE AND SHEER DROP ON THE
OTHER UNTIL HIS ENEMY HAD OVERTAKEN HIM THE YOUNG SWISS HAD GONE
TOO HE HAD PROBABLY BEEN IN THE PAY OF MORIARTY AND HAD LEFT THE
TWO MEN TOGETHER AND THEN WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHO WAS TO TELL US
WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEN
I STOOD FOR A MINUTE OR TWO TO COLLECT MYSELF FOR I WAS DAZED WITH
THE HORROR OF THE THING THEN I BEGAN TO THINK OF HOLMESS OWN
METHODS AND TO TRY TO PRACTISE THEM IN READING THIS TRAGEDY IT WAS
ALAS ONLY TOO EASY TO DO DURING OUR CONVERSATION WE HAD NOT GONE
TO THE END OF THE PATH AND THE ALPINESTOCK MARKED THE PLACE WHERE
WE HAD STOOD THE BLACKISH SOIL IS KEPT FOREVER SOFT BY THE
INCESSANT DRIFT OF SPRAY AND A BIRD WOULD LEAVE ITS TREAD UPON IT TWO
LINES OF FOOTMARKS WERE CLEARLY MARKED ALONG THE FARTHER END OF
THE PATH BOTH LEADING AWAY FROM ME THERE WERE NONE RETURNING A
FEW YARDS FROM THE END THE SOIL WAS ALL PLOUGHED UP INTO A PATCH OF
MUD AND THE BRANCHES AND FERNS WHICH FRINGED THE CHASM WERE TORN AND
BEDRAGGLED I LAY UPON MY FACE AND PEERED OVER WITH THE SPRAY
SPOUTING UP ALL AROUND ME IT HAD DARKENED SINCE I LEFT AND NOW I
COULD ONLY SEE HERE AND THERE THE GLISTENING OF MOISTURE UPON THE
BLACK WALLS AND FAR AWAY DOWN AT THE END OF THE SHAFT THE GLEAM OF
THE BROKEN WATER I SHOUTED BUT ONLY THE SAME HALFHUMAN CRY OF THE
FALL WAS BORNE BACK TO MY EARS
BUT IT WAS DESTINED THAT I SHOULD AFTER ALL HAVE A LAST WORD OF
GREETING FROM MY FRIEND AND COMRADE I HAVE SAID THAT HIS
ALPINESTOCK HAD BEEN LEFT LEANING AGAINST A ROCK WHICH JUTTED ON TO
THE PATH FROM THE TOP OF THIS BOULDER THE GLEAM OF SOMETHING BRIGHT
CAUGHT MY EYE AND RAISING MY HAND I FOUND THAT IT CAME FROM THE
SILVER CIGARETTECASE WHICH HE USED TO CARRY AS I TOOK IT UP A
SMALL SQUARE OF PAPER UPON WHICH IT HAD LAIN FLUTTERED DOWN ON TO THE
GROUND UNFOLDING IT I FOUND THAT IT CONSISTED OF THREE PAGES TORN
FROM HIS NOTEBOOK AND ADDRESSED TO ME IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE
MAN THAT THE DIRECTION WAS AS PRECISE AND THE WRITING AS FIRM AND
CLEAR AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN WRITTEN IN HIS STUDY
MY DEAR WATSON IT SAID
I WRITE THESE FEW LINES THROUGH THE COURTESY OF MR MORIARTY WHO
AWAITS MY CONVENIENCE FOR THE FINAL DISCUSSION OF THOSE QUESTIONS
WHICH LIE BETWEEN US HE HAS BEEN GIVING ME A SKETCH OF THE METHODS
BY WHICH HE AVOIDED THE ENGLISH POLICE AND KEPT HIMSELF INFORMED OF
OUR MOVEMENTS THEY CERTAINLY CONFIRM THE VERY HIGH OPINION WHICH I
HAD FORMED OF HIS ABILITIES I AM PLEASED TO THINK THAT I SHALL BE
ABLE TO FREE SOCIETY FROM ANY FURTHER EFFECTS OF HIS PRESENCE THOUGH
I FEAR THAT IT IS AT A COST WHICH WILL GIVE PAIN TO MY FRIENDS AND
ESPECIALLY MY DEAR WATSON TO YOU I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED TO YOU
HOWEVER THAT MY CAREER HAD IN ANY CASE REACHED ITS CRISIS AND THAT
NO POSSIBLE CONCLUSION TO IT COULD BE MORE CONGENIAL TO ME THAN THIS
INDEED IF I MAY MAKE A FULL CONFESSION TO YOU I WAS QUITE
CONVINCED THAT THE LETTER FROM MEIRINGEN WAS A HOAX AND I ALLOWED
YOU TO DEPART ON THAT ERRAND UNDER THE PERSUASION THAT SOME
DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SORT WOULD FOLLOW TELL INSPECTOR PATTERSON THAT
THE PAPERS WHICH HE NEEDS TO CONVICT THE GANG ARE IN PIGEONHOLE M
DONE UP IN A BLUE ENVELOPE AND INSCRIBED MORIARTY I MADE EVERY
DISPOSITION OF MY PROPERTY BEFORE LEAVING ENGLAND AND HANDED IT TO
MY BROTHER MYCROFT PRAY GIVE MY GREETINGS TO MRS WATSON AND
BELIEVE ME TO BE MY DEAR FELLOW
VERY SINCERELY YOURS
SHERLOCK HOLMES
A FEW WORDS MAY SUFFICE TO TELL THE LITTLE THAT REMAINS AN
EXAMINATION BY EXPERTS LEAVES LITTLE DOUBT THAT A PERSONAL CONTEST
BETWEEN THE TWO MEN ENDED AS IT COULD HARDLY FAIL TO END IN SUCH A
SITUATION IN THEIR REELING OVER LOCKED IN EACH OTHERS ARMS ANY
ATTEMPT AT RECOVERING THE BODIES WAS ABSOLUTELY HOPELESS AND THERE
DEEP DOWN IN THAT DREADFUL CAULDRON OF SWIRLING WATER AND SEETHING
FOAM WILL LIE FOR ALL TIME THE MOST DANGEROUS CRIMINAL AND THE
FOREMOST CHAMPION OF THE LAW OF THEIR GENERATION THE SWISS YOUTH
WAS NEVER FOUND AGAIN AND THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT HE WAS ONE OF
THE NUMEROUS AGENTS WHOM MORIARTY KEPT IN HIS EMPLOY AS TO THE
GANG IT WILL BE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF THE PUBLIC HOW COMPLETELY THE
EVIDENCE WHICH HOLMES HAD ACCUMULATED EXPOSED THEIR ORGANIZATION AND
HOW HEAVILY THE HAND OF THE DEAD MAN WEIGHED UPON THEM OF THEIR
TERRIBLE CHIEF FEW DETAILS CAME OUT DURING THE PROCEEDINGS AND IF I
HAVE NOW BEEN COMPELLED TO MAKE A CLEAR STATEMENT OF HIS CAREER IT IS
DUE TO THOSE INJUDICIOUS CHAMPIONS WHO HAVE ENDEAVORED TO CLEAR HIS
MEMORY BY ATTACKS UPON HIM WHOM I SHALL EVER REGARD AS THE BEST AND
THE WISEST MAN WHOM I HAVE EVER KNOWN
THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE
IT WAS IN THE SPRING OF THE YEAR THAT ALL LONDON WAS INTERESTED
AND THE FASHIONABLE WORLD DISMAYED BY THE MURDER OF THE HONOURABLE
RONALD ADAIR UNDER MOST UNUSUAL AND INEXPLICABLE CIRCUMSTANCES THE
PUBLIC HAS ALREADY LEARNED THOSE PARTICULARS OF THE CRIME WHICH CAME
OUT IN THE POLICE INVESTIGATION BUT A GOOD DEAL WAS SUPPRESSED UPON
THAT OCCASION SINCE THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION WAS SO
OVERWHELMINGLY STRONG THAT IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO BRING FORWARD ALL
THE FACTS ONLY NOW AT THE END OF NEARLY TEN YEARS AM I ALLOWED TO
SUPPLY THOSE MISSING LINKS WHICH MAKE UP THE WHOLE OF THAT REMARKABLE
CHAIN THE CRIME WAS OF INTEREST IN ITSELF BUT THAT INTEREST WAS AS
NOTHING TO ME COMPARED TO THE INCONCEIVABLE SEQUEL WHICH AFFORDED ME
THE GREATEST SHOCK AND SURPRISE OF ANY EVENT IN MY ADVENTUROUS LIFE
EVEN NOW AFTER THIS LONG INTERVAL I FIND MYSELF THRILLING AS I
THINK OF IT AND FEELING ONCE MORE THAT SUDDEN FLOOD OF JOY
AMAZEMENT AND INCREDULITY WHICH UTTERLY SUBMERGED MY MIND LET ME
SAY TO THAT PUBLIC WHICH HAS SHOWN SOME INTEREST IN THOSE GLIMPSES
WHICH I HAVE OCCASIONALLY GIVEN THEM OF THE THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS OF A
VERY REMARKABLE MAN THAT THEY ARE NOT TO BLAME ME IF I HAVE NOT
SHARED MY KNOWLEDGE WITH THEM FOR I SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED IT MY
FIRST DUTY TO HAVE DONE SO HAD I NOT BEEN BARRED BY A POSITIVE
PROHIBITION FROM HIS OWN LIPS WHICH WAS ONLY WITHDRAWN UPON THE
THIRD OF LAST MONTH
IT CAN BE IMAGINED THAT MY CLOSE INTIMACY WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD
INTERESTED ME DEEPLY IN CRIME AND THAT AFTER HIS DISAPPEARANCE I
NEVER FAILED TO READ WITH CARE THE VARIOUS PROBLEMS WHICH CAME BEFORE
THE PUBLIC AND I EVEN ATTEMPTED MORE THAN ONCE FOR MY OWN PRIVATE
SATISFACTION TO EMPLOY HIS METHODS IN THEIR SOLUTION THOUGH WITH
INDIFFERENT SUCCESS THERE WAS NONE HOWEVER WHICH APPEALED TO ME
LIKE THIS TRAGEDY OF RONALD ADAIR AS I READ THE EVIDENCE AT THE
INQUEST WHICH LED UP TO A VERDICT OF WILFUL MURDER AGAINST SOME
PERSON OR PERSONS UNKNOWN I REALIZED MORE CLEARLY THAN I HAD EVER
DONE THE LOSS WHICH THE COMMUNITY HAD SUSTAINED BY THE DEATH OF
SHERLOCK HOLMES THERE WERE POINTS ABOUT THIS STRANGE BUSINESS WHICH
WOULD I WAS SURE HAVE SPECIALLY APPEALED TO HIM AND THE EFFORTS OF
THE POLICE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUPPLEMENTED OR MORE PROBABLY
ANTICIPATED BY THE TRAINED OBSERVATION AND THE ALERT MIND OF THE
FIRST CRIMINAL AGENT IN EUROPE ALL DAY AS I DROVE UPON MY ROUND I
TURNED OVER THE CASE IN MY MIND AND FOUND NO EXPLANATION WHICH
APPEARED TO ME TO BE ADEQUATE AT THE RISK OF TELLING A TWICETOLD
TALE I WILL RECAPITULATE THE FACTS AS THEY WERE KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE INQUEST
THE HONOURABLE RONALD ADAIR WAS THE SECOND SON OF THE EARL OF
MAYNOOTH AT THAT TIME GOVERNOR OF ONE OF THE AUSTRALIAN COLONIES
ADAIRS MOTHER HAD RETURNED FROM AUSTRALIA TO UNDERGO THE OPERATION
FOR CATARACT AND SHE HER SON RONALD AND HER DAUGHTER HILDA WERE
LIVING TOGETHER AT PARK LANE THE YOUTH MOVED IN THE BEST
SOCIETY HAD SO FAR AS WAS KNOWN NO ENEMIES AND NO PARTICULAR
VICES HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED TO MISS EDITH WOODLEY OF CARSTAIRS BUT
THE ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN BROKEN OFF BY MUTUAL CONSENT SOME MONTHS
BEFORE AND THERE WAS NO SIGN THAT IT HAD LEFT ANY VERY PROFOUND
FEELING BEHIND IT FOR THE REST THE MANS LIFE MOVED IN A NARROW AND
CONVENTIONAL CIRCLE FOR HIS HABITS WERE QUIET AND HIS NATURE
UNEMOTIONAL YET IT WAS UPON THIS EASYGOING YOUNG ARISTOCRAT THAT
DEATH CAME IN MOST STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED FORM BETWEEN THE HOURS OF
TEN AND ELEVENTWENTY ON THE NIGHT OF MARCH RONALD ADAIR WAS FOND OF
CARDS PLAYING CONTINUALLY BUT NEVER FOR
SUCH STAKES AS WOULD HURT HIM HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE BALDWIN THE
CAVENDISH AND THE BAGATELLE CARD CLUBS IT WAS SHOWN THAT AFTER
DINNER ON THE DAY OF HIS DEATH HE HAD PLAYED A RUBBER OF WHIST AT THE
LATTER CLUB HE HAD ALSO PLAYED THERE IN THE AFTERNOON THE EVIDENCE
OF THOSE WHO HAD PLAYED WITH HIMMR MURRAY SIR JOHN HARDY AND
COLONEL MORANSHOWED THAT THE GAME WAS WHIST AND THAT THERE WAS A
FAIRLY EQUAL FALL OF THE CARDS ADAIR MIGHT HAVE LOST FIVE POUNDS
BUT NOT MORE HIS FORTUNE WAS A CONSIDERABLE ONE AND SUCH A LOSS
COULD NOT IN ANY WAY AFFECT HIM HE HAD PLAYED NEARLY EVERY DAY AT
ONE CLUB OR OTHER BUT HE WAS A CAUTIOUS PLAYER AND USUALLY ROSE A
WINNER IT CAME OUT IN EVIDENCE THAT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COLONEL
MORAN HE HAD ACTUALLY WON AS MUCH AS FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS
IN A SITTING SOME WEEKS BEFORE FROM GODFREY MILNER AND LORD BALMORAL
SO MUCH FOR HIS RECENT HISTORY AS IT CAME OUT AT THE INQUEST
ON THE EVENING OF THE CRIME HE RETURNED FROM THE CLUB EXACTLY AT TEN
HIS MOTHER AND SISTER WERE OUT SPENDING THE EVENING WITH A RELATION
THE SERVANT DEPOSED THAT SHE HEARD HIM ENTER THE FRONT ROOM ON THE
SECOND FLOOR GENERALLY USED AS HIS SITTINGROOM SHE HAD LIT A FIRE
THERE AND AS IT SMOKED SHE HAD OPENED THE WINDOW NO SOUND WAS HEARD
FROM THE ROOM UNTIL ELEVENTWENTY THE HOUR OF THE RETURN OF LADY
MAYNOOTH AND HER DAUGHTER DESIRING TO SAY GOODNIGHT SHE HAD
ATTEMPTED TO ENTER HER SONS ROOM THE DOOR WAS LOCKED ON THE INSIDE
AND NO ANSWER COULD BE GOT TO THEIR CRIES AND KNOCKING HELP WAS
OBTAINED AND THE DOOR FORCED THE UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN WAS FOUND
LYING NEAR THE TABLE HIS HEAD HAD BEEN HORRIBLY MUTILATED BY AN
EXPANDING REVOLVER BULLET BUT NO WEAPON OF ANY SORT WAS TO BE FOUND
IN THE ROOM ON THE TABLE LAY TWO BANKNOTES FOR TEN POUNDS EACH AND
SEVENTEEN POUNDS TEN IN SILVER AND GOLD THE MONEY ARRANGED IN LITTLE
PILES OF VARYING AMOUNT THERE WERE SOME FIGURES ALSO UPON A SHEET OF
PAPER WITH THE NAMES OF SOME CLUB FRIENDS OPPOSITE TO THEM FROM
WHICH IT WAS CONJECTURED THAT BEFORE HIS DEATH HE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO
MAKE OUT HIS LOSSES OR WINNINGS AT CARDS
A MINUTE EXAMINATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SERVED ONLY TO MAKE THE
CASE MORE COMPLEX IN THE FIRST PLACE NO REASON COULD BE GIVEN WHY
THE YOUNG MAN SHOULD HAVE FASTENED THE DOOR UPON THE INSIDE THERE
WAS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE MURDERER HAD DONE THIS AND HAD
AFTERWARDS ESCAPED BY THE WINDOW THE DROP WAS AT LEAST TWENTY FEET
HOWEVER AND A BED OF CROCUSES IN FULL BLOOM LAY BENEATH NEITHER THE
FLOWERS NOR THE EARTH SHOWED ANY SIGN OF HAVING BEEN DISTURBED NOR
WERE THERE ANY MARKS UPON THE NARROW STRIP OF GRASS WHICH SEPARATED
THE HOUSE FROM THE ROAD APPARENTLY THEREFORE IT WAS THE YOUNG MAN
HIMSELF WHO HAD FASTENED THE DOOR BUT HOW DID HE COME BY HIS DEATH
NO ONE COULD HAVE CLIMBED UP TO THE WINDOW WITHOUT LEAVING TRACES
SUPPOSE A MAN HAD FIRED THROUGH THE WINDOW IT WOULD INDEED BE A
REMARKABLE SHOT WHO COULD WITH A REVOLVER INFLICT SO DEADLY A WOUND
AGAIN PARK LANE IS A FREQUENTED THOROUGHFARE AND THERE IS A
CABSTAND WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE HOUSE NO ONE HAD HEARD A
SHOT AND YET THERE WAS THE DEAD MAN AND THERE THE REVOLVER BULLET
WHICH HAD MUSHROOMED OUT AS SOFTNOSED BULLETS WILL AND SO
INFLICTED A WOUND WHICH MUST HAVE CAUSED INSTANTANEOUS DEATH SUCH
WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARK LANE MYSTERY WHICH WERE FURTHER
COMPLICATED BY ENTIRE ABSENCE OF MOTIVE SINCE AS I HAVE SAID YOUNG
ADAIR WAS NOT KNOWN TO HAVE ANY ENEMY AND NO ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE
TO REMOVE THE MONEY OR VALUABLES IN THE ROOM
ALL DAY I TURNED THESE FACTS OVER IN MY MIND ENDEAVOURING TO HIT
UPON SOME THEORY WHICH COULD RECONCILE THEM ALL AND TO FIND THAT
LINE OF LEAST RESISTANCE WHICH MY POOR FRIEND HAD DECLARED TO BE THE
STARTINGPOINT OF EVERY INVESTIGATION I CONFESS THAT I MADE LITTLE
PROGRESS IN THE EVENING I STROLLED ACROSS THE PARK AND FOUND MYSELF
ABOUT SIX OCLOCK AT THE OXFORD STREET END OF PARK LANE A GROUP OF
LOAFERS UPON THE PAVEMENTS ALL STARING UP AT A PARTICULAR WINDOW
DIRECTED ME TO THE HOUSE WHICH I HAD COME TO SEE A TALL THIN MAN
WITH COLOURED GLASSES WHOM I STRONGLY SUSPECTED OF BEING A
PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE WAS POINTING OUT SOME THEORY OF HIS OWN
WHILE THE OTHERS CROWDED ROUND TO LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID I GOT AS
NEAR HIM AS I COULD BUT HIS OBSERVATIONS SEEMED TO ME TO BE ABSURD
SO I WITHDREW AGAIN IN SOME DISGUST AS I DID SO I STRUCK AGAINST AN
ELDERLY DEFORMED MAN WHO HAD BEEN BEHIND ME AND I KNOCKED DOWN
SEVERAL BOOKS WHICH HE WAS CARRYING I REMEMBER THAT AS I PICKED THEM
UP I OBSERVED THE TITLE OF ONE OF THEM THE ORIGIN OF TREE WORSHIP
AND IT STRUCK ME THAT THE FELLOW MUST BE SOME POOR BIBLIOPHILE WHO
EITHER AS A TRADE OR AS A HOBBY WAS A COLLECTOR OF OBSCURE VOLUMES
I ENDEAVOURED TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE ACCIDENT BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT
THESE BOOKS WHICH I HAD SO UNFORTUNATELY MALTREATED WERE VERY
PRECIOUS OBJECTS IN THE EYES OF THEIR OWNER WITH A SNARL OF CONTEMPT
HE TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND I SAW HIS CURVED BACK AND WHITE
SIDEWHISKERS DISAPPEAR AMONG THE THRONG
MY OBSERVATIONS OF NO PARK LANE DID LITTLE TO CLEAR UP THE
PROBLEM IN WHICH I WAS INTERESTED THE HOUSE WAS SEPARATED FROM THE
STREET BY A LOW WALL AND RAILING THE WHOLE NOT MORE THAN FIVE FEET
HIGH IT WAS PERFECTLY EASY THEREFORE FOR ANYONE TO GET INTO THE
GARDEN BUT THE WINDOW WAS ENTIRELY INACCESSIBLE SINCE THERE WAS NO
WATERPIPE OR ANYTHING WHICH COULD HELP THE MOST ACTIVE MAN TO CLIMB
IT MORE PUZZLED THAN EVER I RETRACED MY STEPS TO KENSINGTON I HAD
NOT BEEN IN MY STUDY FIVE MINUTES WHEN THE MAID ENTERED TO SAY THAT A
PERSON DESIRED TO SEE ME TO MY ASTONISHMENT IT WAS NONE OTHER THAN
MY STRANGE OLD BOOKCOLLECTOR HIS SHARP WIZENED FACE PEERING OUT
FROM A FRAME OF WHITE HAIR AND HIS PRECIOUS VOLUMES A DOZEN OF THEM
AT LEAST WEDGED UNDER HIS RIGHT ARM
YOURE SURPRISED TO SEE ME SIR SAID HE IN A STRANGE CROAKING
VOICE
I ACKNOWLEDGED THAT I WAS
WELL IVE A CONSCIENCE SIR AND WHEN I CHANCED TO SEE YOU GO INTO
THIS HOUSE AS I CAME HOBBLING AFTER YOU I THOUGHT TO MYSELF ILL
JUST STEP IN AND SEE THAT KIND GENTLEMAN AND TELL HIM THAT IF I WAS
A BIT GRUFF IN MY MANNER THERE WAS NOT ANY HARM MEANT AND THAT I AM
MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM FOR PICKING UP MY BOOKS
YOU MAKE TOO MUCH OF A TRIFLE SAID I MAY I ASK HOW YOU KNEW WHO
I WAS
WELL SIR IF IT ISNT TOO GREAT A LIBERTY I AM A NEIGHBOUR OF
YOURS FOR YOULL FIND MY LITTLE BOOKSHOP AT THE CORNER OF CHURCH
STREET AND VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU I AM SURE MAYBE YOU COLLECT
YOURSELF SIR HERES BRITISH BIRDS AND CATULLUS AND THE HOLY
WARA BARGAIN EVERY ONE OF THEM WITH FIVE VOLUMES YOU COULD JUST
FILL THAT GAP ON THAT SECOND SHELF IT LOOKS UNTIDY DOES IT NOT
SIR
I MOVED MY HEAD TO LOOK AT THE CABINET BEHIND ME WHEN I TURNED AGAIN
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS STANDING SMILING AT ME ACROSS MY STUDY TABLE I
ROSE TO MY FEET STARED AT HIM FOR SOME SECONDS IN UTTER AMAZEMENT
AND THEN IT APPEARS THAT I MUST HAVE FAINTED FOR THE FIRST AND THE
LAST TIME IN MY LIFE CERTAINLY A GREY MIST SWIRLED BEFORE MY EYES
AND WHEN IT CLEARED I FOUND MY COLLARENDS UNDONE AND THE TINGLING
AFTERTASTE OF BRANDY UPON MY LIPS HOLMES WAS BENDING OVER MY CHAIR
HIS FLASK IN HIS HAND
MY DEAR WATSON SAID THE WELLREMEMBERED VOICE I OWE YOU A
THOUSAND APOLOGIES I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU WOULD BE SO AFFECTED
I GRIPPED HIM BY THE ARM
HOLMES I CRIED IS IT REALLY YOU CAN IT INDEED BE THAT YOU ARE
ALIVE IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU SUCCEEDED IN CLIMBING OUT OF THAT
AWFUL ABYSS
WAIT A MOMENT SAID HE ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU ARE REALLY FIT TO
DISCUSS THINGS I HAVE GIVEN YOU A SERIOUS SHOCK BY MY UNNECESSARILY
DRAMATIC REAPPEARANCE
I AM ALL RIGHT BUT INDEED HOLMES I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE MY EYES
GOOD HEAVENS TO THINK THAT YOUYOU OF ALL MENSHOULD BE STANDING
IN MY STUDY AGAIN I GRIPPED HIM BY THE SLEEVE AND FELT THE THIN
SINEWY ARM BENEATH IT WELL YOURE NOT A SPIRIT ANYHOW SAID I
MY DEAR CHAP I AM OVERJOYED TO SEE YOU SIT DOWN AND TELL ME HOW
YOU CAME ALIVE OUT OF THAT DREADFUL CHASM
HE SAT OPPOSITE TO ME AND LIT A CIGARETTE IN HIS OLD NONCHALANT
MANNER HE WAS DRESSED IN THE SEEDY FROCKCOAT OF THE BOOK MERCHANT
BUT THE REST OF THAT INDIVIDUAL LAY IN A PILE OF WHITE HAIR AND OLD
BOOKS UPON THE TABLE HOLMES LOOKED EVEN THINNER AND KEENER THAN OF
OLD BUT THERE WAS A DEADWHITE TINGE IN HIS AQUILINE FACE WHICH TOLD
ME THAT HIS LIFE RECENTLY HAD NOT BEEN A HEALTHY ONE
I AM GLAD TO STRETCH MYSELF WATSON SAID HE IT IS NO JOKE WHEN A
TALL MAN HAS TO TAKE A FOOT OFF HIS STATURE FOR SEVERAL HOURS ON END
NOW MY DEAR FELLOW IN THE MATTER OF THESE EXPLANATIONS WE HAVE IF
I MAY ASK FOR YOUR COOPERATION A HARD AND DANGEROUS NIGHTS WORK IN
FRONT OF US PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER IF I GAVE YOU AN ACCOUNT OF
THE WHOLE SITUATION WHEN THAT WORK IS FINISHED
I AM FULL OF CURIOSITY I SHOULD MUCH PREFER TO HEAR NOW
YOULL COME WITH ME TONIGHT
WHEN YOU LIKE AND WHERE YOU LIKE
THIS IS INDEED LIKE THE OLD DAYS WE SHALL HAVE TIME FOR A MOUTHFUL
OF DINNER BEFORE WE NEED GO WELL THEN ABOUT THAT CHASM I HAD NO
SERIOUS DIFFICULTY IN GETTING OUT OF IT FOR THE VERY SIMPLE REASON
THAT I NEVER WAS IN IT
YOU NEVER WERE IN IT
NO WATSON I NEVER WAS IN IT MY NOTE TO YOU WAS ABSOLUTELY
GENUINE I HAD LITTLE DOUBT THAT I HAD COME TO THE END OF MY CAREER
WHEN I PERCEIVED THE SOMEWHAT SINISTER FIGURE OF THE LATE PROFESSOR
MORIARTY STANDING UPON THE NARROW PATHWAY WHICH LED TO SAFETY I READ
AN INEXORABLE PURPOSE IN HIS GREY EYES I EXCHANGED SOME REMARKS WITH
HIM THEREFORE AND OBTAINED HIS COURTEOUS PERMISSION TO WRITE THE
SHORT NOTE WHICH YOU AFTERWARDS RECEIVED I LEFT IT WITH MY
CIGARETTEBOX AND MY STICK AND I WALKED ALONG THE PATHWAY MORIARTY
STILL AT MY HEELS WHEN I REACHED THE END I STOOD AT BAY HE DREW NO
WEAPON BUT HE RUSHED AT ME AND THREW HIS LONG ARMS AROUND ME HE
KNEW THAT HIS OWN GAME WAS UP AND WAS ONLY ANXIOUS TO REVENGE
HIMSELF UPON ME WE TOTTERED TOGETHER UPON THE BRINK OF THE FALL I
HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE HOWEVER OF BARITSU OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF
WRESTLING WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME I SLIPPED
THROUGH HIS GRIP AND HE WITH A HORRIBLE SCREAM KICKED MADLY FOR A
FEW SECONDS AND CLAWED THE AIR WITH BOTH HIS HANDS BUT FOR ALL HIS
EFFORTS HE COULD NOT GET HIS BALANCE AND OVER HE WENT WITH MY FACE
OVER THE BRINK I SAW HIM FALL FOR A LONG WAY THEN HE STRUCK A ROCK
BOUNDED OFF AND SPLASHED INTO THE WATER
I LISTENED WITH AMAZEMENT TO THIS EXPLANATION WHICH HOLMES DELIVERED
BETWEEN THE PUFFS OF HIS CIGARETTE
BUT THE TRACKS I CRIED I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES THAT TWO WENT DOWN
THE PATH AND NONE RETURNED
IT CAME ABOUT IN THIS WAY THE INSTANT THAT THE PROFESSOR HAD
DISAPPEARED IT STRUCK ME WHAT A REALLY EXTRAORDINARILY LUCKY CHANCE
FATE HAD PLACED IN MY WAY I KNEW THAT MORIARTY WAS NOT THE ONLY MAN
WHO HAD SWORN MY DEATH THERE WERE AT LEAST THREE OTHERS WHOSE DESIRE
FOR VENGEANCE UPON ME WOULD ONLY BE INCREASED BY THE DEATH OF THEIR
LEADER THEY WERE ALL MOST DANGEROUS MEN ONE OR OTHER WOULD
CERTAINLY GET ME ON THE OTHER HAND IF ALL THE WORLD WAS CONVINCED
THAT I WAS DEAD THEY WOULD TAKE LIBERTIES THESE MEN THEY WOULD LAY
THEMSELVES OPEN AND SOONER OR LATER I COULD DESTROY THEM THEN IT
WOULD BE TIME FOR ME TO ANNOUNCE THAT I WAS STILL IN THE LAND OF THE
LIVING SO RAPIDLY DOES THE BRAIN ACT THAT I BELIEVE I HAD THOUGHT
THIS ALL OUT BEFORE PROFESSOR MORIARTY HAD REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE
REICHENBACH FALL
I STOOD UP AND EXAMINED THE ROCKY WALL BEHIND ME IN YOUR
PICTURESQUE ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER WHICH I READ WITH GREAT INTEREST
SOME MONTHS LATER YOU ASSERT THAT THE WALL WAS SHEER THIS WAS NOT
LITERALLY TRUE A FEW SMALL FOOTHOLDS PRESENTED THEMSELVES AND THERE
WAS SOME INDICATION OF A LEDGE THE CLIFF IS SO HIGH THAT TO CLIMB IT
ALL WAS AN OBVIOUS IMPOSSIBILITY AND IT WAS EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO
MAKE MY WAY ALONG THE WET PATH WITHOUT LEAVING SOME TRACKS I MIGHT
IT IS TRUE HAVE REVERSED MY BOOTS AS I HAVE DONE ON SIMILAR
OCCASIONS BUT THE SIGHT OF THREE SETS OF TRACKS IN ONE DIRECTION
WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SUGGESTED A DECEPTION ON THE WHOLE THEN IT
WAS BEST THAT I SHOULD RISK THE CLIMB IT WAS NOT A PLEASANT
BUSINESS WATSON THE FALL ROARED BENEATH ME I AM NOT A FANCIFUL
PERSON BUT I GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT I SEEMED TO HEAR MORIARTYS VOICE
SCREAMING AT ME OUT OF THE ABYSS A MISTAKE WOULD HAVE BEEN FATAL
MORE THAN ONCE AS TUFTS OF GRASS CAME OUT IN MY HAND OR MY FOOT
SLIPPED IN THE WET NOTCHES OF THE ROCK I THOUGHT THAT I WAS GONE
BUT I STRUGGLED UPWARDS AND AT LAST I REACHED A LEDGE SEVERAL FEET
DEEP AND COVERED WITH SOFT GREEN MOSS WHERE I COULD LIE UNSEEN IN
THE MOST PERFECT COMFORT THERE I WAS STRETCHED WHEN YOU MY DEAR
WATSON AND ALL YOUR FOLLOWING WERE INVESTIGATING IN THE MOST
SYMPATHETIC AND INEFFICIENT MANNER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY DEATH
AT LAST WHEN YOU HAD ALL FORMED YOUR INEVITABLE AND TOTALLY
ERRONEOUS CONCLUSIONS YOU DEPARTED FOR THE HOTEL AND I WAS LEFT
ALONE I HAD IMAGINED THAT I HAD REACHED THE END OF MY ADVENTURES
BUT A VERY UNEXPECTED OCCURRENCE SHOWED ME THAT THERE WERE SURPRISES
STILL IN STORE FOR ME A HUGE ROCK FALLING FROM ABOVE BOOMED PAST
ME STRUCK THE PATH AND BOUNDED OVER INTO THE CHASM FOR AN INSTANT
I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT BUT A MOMENT LATER LOOKING UP I
SAW A MANS HEAD AGAINST THE DARKENING SKY AND ANOTHER STONE STRUCK
THE VERY LEDGE UPON WHICH I WAS STRETCHED WITHIN A FOOT OF MY HEAD
OF COURSE THE MEANING OF THIS WAS OBVIOUS MORIARTY HAD NOT BEEN
ALONE A CONFEDERATEAND EVEN THAT ONE GLANCE HAD TOLD ME HOW
DANGEROUS A MAN THAT CONFEDERATE WASHAD KEPT GUARD WHILE THE
PROFESSOR HAD ATTACKED ME FROM A DISTANCE UNSEEN BY ME HE HAD BEEN
A WITNESS OF HIS FRIENDS DEATH AND OF MY ESCAPE HE HAD WAITED AND
THEN MAKING HIS WAY ROUND TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF HE HAD
ENDEAVOURED TO SUCCEED WHERE HIS COMRADE HAD FAILED
I DID NOT TAKE LONG TO THINK ABOUT IT WATSON AGAIN I SAW THAT GRIM
FACE LOOK OVER THE CLIFF AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS THE PRECURSOR OF
ANOTHER STONE I SCRAMBLED DOWN ON TO THE PATH I DONT THINK I COULD
HAVE DONE IT IN COLD BLOOD IT WAS A HUNDRED TIMES MORE DIFFICULT
THAN GETTING UP BUT I HAD NO TIME TO THINK OF THE DANGER FOR
ANOTHER STONE SANG PAST ME AS I HUNG BY MY HANDS FROM THE EDGE OF THE
LEDGE HALFWAY DOWN I SLIPPED BUT BY THE BLESSING OF GOD I LANDED
TORN AND BLEEDING UPON THE PATH I TOOK TO MY HEELS DID TEN MILES
OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN THE DARKNESS AND A WEEK LATER I FOUND MYSELF
IN FLORENCE WITH THE CERTAINTY THAT NO ONE IN THE WORLD KNEW WHAT HAD
BECOME OF ME
I HAD ONLY ONE CONFIDANTMY BROTHER MYCROFT I OWE YOU MANY
APOLOGIES MY DEAR WATSON BUT IT WAS ALLIMPORTANT THAT IT SHOULD BE
THOUGHT I WAS DEAD AND IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE
WRITTEN SO CONVINCING AN ACCOUNT OF MY UNHAPPY END HAD YOU NOT
YOURSELF THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TRUE SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE LAST
THREE YEARS I HAVE TAKEN UP MY PEN TO WRITE TO YOU BUT ALWAYS I
FEARED LEST YOUR AFFECTIONATE REGARD FOR ME SHOULD TEMPT YOU TO SOME
INDISCRETION WHICH WOULD BETRAY MY SECRET FOR THAT REASON I TURNED
AWAY FROM YOU THIS EVENING WHEN YOU UPSET MY BOOKS FOR I WAS IN
DANGER AT THE TIME AND ANY SHOW OF SURPRISE AND EMOTION UPON YOUR
PART MIGHT HAVE DRAWN ATTENTION TO MY IDENTITY AND LED TO THE MOST
DEPLORABLE AND IRREPARABLE RESULTS AS TO MYCROFT I HAD TO CONFIDE
IN HIM IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE MONEY WHICH I NEEDED THE COURSE OF
EVENTS IN LONDON DID NOT RUN SO WELL AS I HAD HOPED FOR THE TRIAL OF
THE MORIARTY GANG LEFT TWO OF ITS MOST DANGEROUS MEMBERS MY OWN MOST
VINDICTIVE ENEMIES AT LIBERTY I TRAVELLED FOR TWO YEARS IN TIBET
THEREFORE AND AMUSED MYSELF BY VISITING LHASSA AND SPENDING SOME
DAYS WITH THE HEAD LLAMA YOU MAY HAVE READ OF THE REMARKABLE
EXPLORATIONS OF A NORWEGIAN NAMED SIGERSON BUT I AM SURE THAT IT
NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU THAT YOU WERE RECEIVING NEWS OF YOUR FRIEND I
THEN PASSED THROUGH PERSIA LOOKED IN AT MECCA AND PAID A SHORT BUT
INTERESTING VISIT TO THE KHALIFA AT KHARTOUM THE RESULTS OF WHICH I
HAVE COMMUNICATED TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE RETURNING TO FRANCE I SPENT
SOME MONTHS IN A RESEARCH INTO THE COALTAR DERIVATIVES WHICH I
CONDUCTED IN A LABORATORY AT MONTPELIER IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
HAVING CONCLUDED THIS TO MY SATISFACTION AND LEARNING THAT ONLY ONE
OF MY ENEMIES WAS NOW LEFT IN LONDON I WAS ABOUT TO RETURN WHEN MY
MOVEMENTS WERE HASTENED BY THE NEWS OF THIS VERY REMARKABLE PARK LANE
MYSTERY WHICH NOT ONLY APPEALED TO ME BY ITS OWN MERITS BUT WHICH
SEEMED TO OFFER SOME MOST PECULIAR PERSONAL OPPORTUNITIES I CAME
OVER AT ONCE TO LONDON CALLED IN MY OWN PERSON AT BAKER STREET
THREW MRS HUDSON INTO VIOLENT HYSTERICS AND FOUND THAT MYCROFT HAD
PRESERVED MY ROOMS AND MY PAPERS EXACTLY AS THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN SO
IT WAS MY DEAR WATSON THAT AT TWO OCLOCK TODAY I FOUND MYSELF IN
MY OLD ARMCHAIR IN MY OWN OLD ROOM AND ONLY WISHING THAT I COULD
HAVE SEEN MY OLD FRIEND WATSON IN THE OTHER CHAIR WHICH HE HAS SO
OFTEN ADORNED
SUCH WAS THE REMARKABLE NARRATIVE TO WHICH I LISTENED ON THAT APRIL
EVENINGA NARRATIVE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN UTTERLY INCREDIBLE TO ME
HAD IT NOT BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE ACTUAL SIGHT OF THE TALL SPARE
FIGURE AND THE KEEN EAGER FACE WHICH I HAD NEVER THOUGHT TO SEE
AGAIN IN SOME MANNER HE HAD LEARNED OF MY OWN SAD BEREAVEMENT AND
HIS SYMPATHY WAS SHOWN IN HIS MANNER RATHER THAN IN HIS WORDS WORK
IS THE BEST ANTIDOTE TO SORROW MY DEAR WATSON SAID HE AND I HAVE
A PIECE OF WORK FOR US BOTH TONIGHT WHICH IF WE CAN BRING IT TO A
SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION WILL IN ITSELF JUSTIFY A MANS LIFE ON THIS
PLANET IN VAIN I BEGGED HIM TO TELL ME MORE YOU WILL HEAR AND SEE
ENOUGH BEFORE MORNING HE ANSWERED WE HAVE THREE YEARS OF THE PAST
TO DISCUSS LET THAT SUFFICE UNTIL HALFPAST NINE WHEN WE START UPON
THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE
IT WAS INDEED LIKE OLD TIMES WHEN AT THAT HOUR I FOUND MYSELF
SEATED BESIDE HIM IN A HANSOM MY REVOLVER IN MY POCKET AND THE
THRILL OF ADVENTURE IN MY HEART HOLMES WAS COLD AND STERN AND
SILENT AS THE GLEAM OF THE STREETLAMPS FLASHED UPON HIS AUSTERE
FEATURES I SAW THAT HIS BROWS WERE DRAWN DOWN IN THOUGHT AND HIS THIN
LIPS COMPRESSED I KNEW NOT WHAT WILD BEAST WE WERE ABOUT TO HUNT
DOWN IN THE DARK JUNGLE OF CRIMINAL LONDON BUT I WAS WELL ASSURED
FROM THE BEARING OF THIS MASTER HUNTSMAN THAT THE ADVENTURE WAS A
MOST GRAVE ONE WHILE THE SARDONIC SMILE WHICH OCCASIONALLY BROKE
THROUGH HIS ASCETIC GLOOM BODED LITTLE GOOD FOR THE OBJECT OF OUR
QUEST
I HAD IMAGINED THAT WE WERE BOUND FOR BAKER STREET BUT HOLMES
STOPPED THE CAB AT THE CORNER OF CAVENDISH SQUARE I OBSERVED THAT AS
HE STEPPED OUT HE GAVE A MOST SEARCHING GLANCE TO RIGHT AND LEFT AND
AT EVERY SUBSEQUENT STREET CORNER HE TOOK THE UTMOST PAINS TO ASSURE
THAT HE WAS NOT FOLLOWED OUR ROUTE WAS CERTAINLY A SINGULAR ONE
HOLMESS KNOWLEDGE OF THE BYWAYS OF LONDON WAS EXTRAORDINARY AND ON
THIS OCCASION HE PASSED RAPIDLY AND WITH AN ASSURED STEP THROUGH A
NETWORK OF MEWS AND STABLES THE VERY EXISTENCE OF WHICH I HAD NEVER
KNOWN WE EMERGED AT LAST INTO A SMALL ROAD LINED WITH OLD GLOOMY
HOUSES WHICH LED US INTO MANCHESTER STREET AND SO TO BLANDFORD
STREET HERE HE TURNED SWIFTLY DOWN A NARROW PASSAGE PASSED THROUGH
A WOODEN GATE INTO A DESERTED YARD AND THEN OPENED WITH A KEY THE
BACK DOOR OF A HOUSE WE ENTERED TOGETHER AND HE CLOSED IT BEHIND US
THE PLACE WAS PITCHDARK BUT IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT IT WAS AN
EMPTY HOUSE OUR FEET CREAKED AND CRACKLED OVER THE BARE PLANKING
AND MY OUTSTRETCHED HAND TOUCHED A WALL FROM WHICH THE PAPER WAS
HANGING IN RIBBONS HOLMESS COLD THIN FINGERS CLOSED ROUND MY WRIST
AND LED ME FORWARDS DOWN A LONG HALL UNTIL I DIMLY SAW THE MURKY
FANLIGHT OVER THE DOOR HERE HOLMES TURNED SUDDENLY TO THE RIGHT AND
WE FOUND OURSELVES IN A LARGE SQUARE EMPTY ROOM HEAVILY SHADOWED
IN THE CORNERS BUT FAINTLY LIT IN THE CENTRE FROM THE LIGHTS OF THE
STREET BEYOND THERE WAS NO LAMP NEAR AND THE WINDOW WAS THICK WITH
DUST SO THAT WE COULD ONLY JUST DISCERN EACH OTHERS FIGURES WITHIN
MY COMPANION PUT HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER AND HIS LIPS CLOSE TO MY
EAR
DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE HE WHISPERED
SURELY THAT IS BAKER STREET I ANSWERED STARING THROUGH THE DIM
WINDOW
EXACTLY WE ARE IN CAMDEN HOUSE WHICH STANDS OPPOSITE TO OUR OWN
OLD QUARTERS
BUT WHY ARE WE HERE
BECAUSE IT COMMANDS SO EXCELLENT A VIEW OF THAT PICTURESQUE PILE
MIGHT I TROUBLE YOU MY DEAR WATSON TO DRAW A LITTLE NEARER TO THE
WINDOW TAKING EVERY PRECAUTION NOT TO SHOW YOURSELF AND THEN TO
LOOK UP AT OUR OLD ROOMSTHE STARTINGPOINT OF SO MANY OF OUR LITTLE
ADVENTURES WE WILL SEE IF MY THREE YEARS OF ABSENCE HAVE ENTIRELY
TAKEN AWAY MY POWER TO SURPRISE YOU
I CREPT FORWARD AND LOOKED ACROSS AT THE FAMILIAR WINDOW AS MY EYES
FELL UPON IT I GAVE A GASP AND A CRY OF AMAZEMENT THE BLIND WAS DOWN
AND A STRONG LIGHT WAS BURNING IN THE ROOM THE SHADOW OF A MAN WHO
WAS SEATED IN A CHAIR WITHIN WAS THROWN IN HARD BLACK OUTLINE UPON
THE LUMINOUS SCREEN OF THE WINDOW THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THE POISE
OF THE HEAD THE SQUARENESS OF THE SHOULDERS THE SHARPNESS OF THE
FEATURES THE FACE WAS TURNED HALFROUND AND THE EFFECT WAS THAT OF
ONE OF THOSE BLACK SILHOUETTES WHICH OUR GRANDPARENTS LOVED TO FRAME
IT WAS A PERFECT REPRODUCTION OF HOLMES SO AMAZED WAS I THAT I THREW
OUT MY HAND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MAN HIMSELF WAS STANDING BESIDE ME
HE WAS QUIVERING WITH SILENT LAUGHTER
WELL SAID HE
GOOD HEAVENS I CRIED IT IS MARVELLOUS
I TRUST THAT AGE DOTH NOT WITHER NOR CUSTOM STALE MY INFINITE
VARIETY SAID HE AND I RECOGNISED IN HIS VOICE THE JOY AND PRIDE
WHICH THE ARTIST TAKES IN HIS OWN CREATION IT REALLY IS RATHER LIKE
ME IS IT NOT
I SHOULD BE PREPARED TO SWEAR THAT IT WAS YOU
THE CREDIT OF THE EXECUTION IS DUE TO MONSIEUR OSCAR MEUNIER OF
GRENOBLE WHO SPENT SOME DAYS IN DOING THE MOULDING IT IS A BUST IN
WAX THE REST I ARRANGED MYSELF DURING MY VISIT TO BAKER STREET THIS
AFTERNOON
BUT WHY
BECAUSE MY DEAR WATSON I HAD THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE REASON FOR
WISHING CERTAIN PEOPLE TO THINK THAT I WAS THERE WHEN I WAS REALLY
ELSEWHERE
AND YOU THOUGHT THE ROOMS WERE WATCHED
I KNEW THAT THEY WERE WATCHED
BY WHOM
BY MY OLD ENEMIES WATSON BY THE CHARMING SOCIETY WHOSE LEADER LIES
IN THE REICHENBACH FALL YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY KNEW AND ONLY
THEY KNEW THAT I WAS STILL ALIVE SOONER OR LATER THEY BELIEVED THAT
I SHOULD COME BACK TO MY ROOMS THEY WATCHED THEM CONTINUOUSLY AND
THIS MORNING THEY SAW ME ARRIVE
HOW DO YOU KNOW
BECAUSE I RECOGNISED THEIR SENTINEL WHEN I GLANCED OUT OF MY WINDOW
HE IS A HARMLESS ENOUGH FELLOW PARKER BY NAME A GARROTER BY TRADE
AND A REMARKABLE PERFORMER UPON THE JEWS HARP I CARED NOTHING FOR
HIM BUT I CARED A GREAT DEAL FOR THE MUCH MORE FORMIDABLE PERSON WHO
WAS BEHIND HIM THE BOSOM FRIEND OF MORIARTY THE MAN WHO DROPPED THE
ROCKS OVER THE CLIFF THE MOST CUNNING AND DANGEROUS CRIMINAL IN
LONDON THAT IS THE MAN WHO IS AFTER ME TONIGHT WATSON AND THAT IS
THE MAN WHO IS QUITE UNAWARE THAT WE ARE AFTER HIM
MY FRIENDS PLANS WERE GRADUALLY REVEALING THEMSELVES FROM THIS
CONVENIENT RETREAT THE WATCHERS WERE BEING WATCHED AND THE TRACKERS
TRACKED THAT ANGULAR SHADOW UP YONDER WAS THE BAIT AND WE WERE THE
HUNTERS IN SILENCE WE STOOD TOGETHER IN THE DARKNESS AND WATCHED THE
HURRYING FIGURES WHO PASSED AND REPASSED IN FRONT OF US HOLMES WAS
SILENT AND MOTIONLESS BUT I COULD TELL THAT HE WAS KEENLY ALERT AND
THAT HIS EYES WERE FIXED INTENTLY UPON THE STREAM OF PASSERSBY IT
WAS A BLEAK AND BOISTEROUS NIGHT AND THE WIND WHISTLED SHRILLY DOWN
THE LONG STREET MANY PEOPLE WERE MOVING TO AND FRO MOST OF THEM
MUFFLED IN THEIR COATS AND CRAVATS ONCE OR TWICE IT SEEMED TO ME
THAT I HAD SEEN THE SAME FIGURE BEFORE AND I ESPECIALLY NOTICED TWO
MEN WHO APPEARED TO BE SHELTERING THEMSELVES FROM THE WIND IN THE
DOORWAY OF A HOUSE SOME DISTANCE UP THE STREET I TRIED TO DRAW MY
COMPANIONS ATTENTION TO THEM BUT HE GAVE A LITTLE EJACULATION OF
IMPATIENCE AND CONTINUED TO STARE INTO THE STREET MORE THAN ONCE HE
FIDGETED WITH HIS FEET AND TAPPED RAPIDLY WITH HIS FINGERS UPON THE
WALL IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT HE WAS BECOMING UNEASY AND THAT HIS
PLANS WERE NOT WORKING OUT ALTOGETHER AS HE HAD HOPED AT LAST AS
MIDNIGHT APPROACHED AND THE STREET GRADUALLY CLEARED HE PACED UP AND
DOWN THE ROOM IN UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION I WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME
REMARK TO HIM WHEN I RAISED MY EYES TO THE LIGHTED WINDOW AND AGAIN
EXPERIENCED ALMOST AS GREAT A SURPRISE AS BEFORE I CLUTCHED HOLMESS
ARM AND POINTED UPWARDS
THE SHADOW HAS MOVED I CRIED
IT WAS INDEED NO LONGER THE PROFILE BUT THE BACK WHICH WAS TURNED
TOWARDS US
THREE YEARS HAD CERTAINLY NOT SMOOTHED THE ASPERITIES OF HIS TEMPER
OR HIS IMPATIENCE WITH A LESS ACTIVE INTELLIGENCE THAN HIS OWN
OF COURSE IT HAS MOVED SAID HE AM I SUCH A FARCICAL BUNGLER
WATSON THAT I SHOULD ERECT AN OBVIOUS DUMMY AND EXPECT THAT SOME OF
THE SHARPEST MEN IN EUROPE WOULD BE DECEIVED BY IT WE HAVE BEEN IN
THIS ROOM TWO HOURS AND MRS HUDSON HAS MADE SOME CHANGE IN THAT
FIGURE EIGHT TIMES OR ONCE IN EVERY QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE WORKS IT
FROM THE FRONT SO THAT HER SHADOW MAY NEVER BE SEEN AH HE DREW IN
HIS BREATH WITH A SHRILL EXCITED INTAKE IN THE DIM LIGHT I SAW HIS
HEAD THROWN FORWARD HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE RIGID WITH ATTENTION
OUTSIDE THE STREET WAS ABSOLUTELY DESERTED THOSE TWO MEN MIGHT
STILL BE CROUCHING IN THE DOORWAY BUT I COULD NO LONGER SEE THEM
ALL WAS STILL AND DARK SAVE ONLY THAT BRILLIANT YELLOW SCREEN IN
FRONT OF US WITH THE BLACK FIGURE OUTLINED UPON ITS CENTRE AGAIN IN
THE UTTER SILENCE I HEARD THAT THIN SIBILANT NOTE WHICH SPOKE OF
INTENSE SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT AN INSTANT LATER HE PULLED ME BACK
INTO THE BLACKEST CORNER OF THE ROOM AND I FELT HIS WARNING HAND
UPON MY LIPS THE FINGERS WHICH CLUTCHED ME WERE QUIVERING NEVER HAD
I KNOWN MY FRIEND MORE MOVED AND YET THE DARK STREET STILL STRETCHED
LONELY AND MOTIONLESS BEFORE US
BUT SUDDENLY I WAS AWARE OF THAT WHICH HIS KEENER SENSES HAD ALREADY
DISTINGUISHED A LOW STEALTHY SOUND CAME TO MY EARS NOT FROM THE
DIRECTION OF BAKER STREET BUT FROM THE BACK OF THE VERY HOUSE IN
WHICH WE LAY CONCEALED A DOOR OPENED AND SHUT AN INSTANT LATER
STEPS CREPT DOWN THE PASSAGESTEPS WHICH WERE MEANT TO BE SILENT
BUT WHICH REVERBERATED HARSHLY THROUGH THE EMPTY HOUSE HOLMES
CROUCHED BACK AGAINST THE WALL AND I DID THE SAME MY HAND CLOSING
UPON THE HANDLE OF MY REVOLVER PEERING THROUGH THE GLOOM I SAW THE
VAGUE OUTLINE OF A MAN A SHADE BLACKER THAN THE BLACKNESS OF THE
OPEN DOOR HE STOOD FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN HE CREPT FORWARD
CROUCHING MENACING INTO THE ROOM HE WAS WITHIN THREE YARDS OF US
THIS SINISTER FIGURE AND I HAD BRACED MYSELF TO MEET HIS SPRING
BEFORE I REALIZED THAT HE HAD NO IDEA OF OUR PRESENCE HE PASSED
CLOSE BESIDE US STOLE OVER TO THE WINDOW AND VERY SOFTLY AND
NOISELESSLY RAISED IT FOR HALF A FOOT AS HE SANK TO THE LEVEL OF
THIS OPENING THE LIGHT OF THE STREET NO LONGER DIMMED BY THE DUSTY
GLASS FELL FULL UPON HIS FACE THE MAN SEEMED TO BE BESIDE HIMSELF
WITH EXCITEMENT HIS TWO EYES SHONE LIKE STARS AND HIS FEATURES WERE
WORKING CONVULSIVELY HE WAS AN ELDERLY MAN WITH A THIN PROJECTING
NOSE A HIGH BALD FOREHEAD AND A HUGE GRIZZLED MOUSTACHE AN
OPERAHAT WAS PUSHED TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND AN EVENING DRESS
SHIRTFRONT GLEAMED OUT THROUGH HIS OPEN OVERCOAT HIS FACE WAS GAUNT
AND SWARTHY SCORED WITH DEEP SAVAGE LINES IN HIS HAND HE CARRIED
WHAT APPEARED TO BE A STICK BUT AS HE LAID IT DOWN UPON THE FLOOR IT
GAVE A METALLIC CLANG THEN FROM THE POCKET OF HIS OVERCOAT HE DREW A
BULKY OBJECT AND HE BUSIED HIMSELF IN SOME TASK WHICH ENDED WITH A
LOUD SHARP CLICK AS IF A SPRING OR BOLT HAD FALLEN INTO ITS PLACE
STILL KNEELING UPON THE FLOOR HE BENT FORWARD AND THREW ALL HIS
WEIGHT AND STRENGTH UPON SOME LEVER WITH THE RESULT THAT THERE CAME
A LONG WHIRLING GRINDING NOISE ENDING ONCE MORE IN A POWERFUL
CLICK HE STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF THEN AND I SAW THAT WHAT HE HELD IN
HIS HAND WAS A SORT OF GUN WITH A CURIOUSLY MISSHAPEN BUTT HE
OPENED IT AT THE BREECH PUT SOMETHING IN AND SNAPPED THE
BREECHBLOCK THEN CROUCHING DOWN HE RESTED THE END OF THE BARREL
UPON THE LEDGE OF THE OPEN WINDOW AND I SAW HIS LONG MOUSTACHE DROOP
OVER THE STOCK AND HIS EYE GLEAM AS IT PEERED ALONG THE SIGHTS I
HEARD A LITTLE SIGH OF SATISFACTION AS HE CUDDLED THE BUTT INTO HIS
SHOULDER AND SAW THAT AMAZING TARGET THE BLACK MAN ON THE YELLOW
GROUND STANDING CLEAR AT THE END OF HIS FORE SIGHT FOR AN INSTANT
HE WAS RIGID AND MOTIONLESS THEN HIS FINGER TIGHTENED ON THE
TRIGGER THERE WAS A STRANGE LOUD WHIZ AND A LONG SILVERY TINKLE OF
BROKEN GLASS AT THAT INSTANT HOLMES SPRANG LIKE A TIGER ON TO THE
MARKSMANS BACK AND HURLED HIM FLAT UPON HIS FACE HE WAS UP AGAIN IN
A MOMENT AND WITH CONVULSIVE STRENGTH HE SEIZED HOLMES BY THE
THROAT BUT I STRUCK HIM ON THE HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF MY REVOLVER AND
HE DROPPED AGAIN UPON THE FLOOR I FELL UPON HIM AND AS I HELD HIM
MY COMRADE BLEW A SHRILL CALL UPON A WHISTLE THERE WAS THE CLATTER
OF RUNNING FEET UPON THE PAVEMENT AND TWO POLICEMEN IN UNIFORM WITH
ONE PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE RUSHED THROUGH THE FRONT ENTRANCE AND
INTO THE ROOM
THAT YOU LESTRADE SAID HOLMES
YES MR HOLMES I TOOK THE JOB MYSELF ITS GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK IN
LONDON SIR
I THINK YOU WANT A LITTLE UNOFFICIAL HELP THREE UNDETECTED MURDERS
IN ONE YEAR WONT DO LESTRADE BUT YOU HANDLED THE MOLESEY MYSTERY
WITH LESS THAN YOUR USUALTHATS TO SAY YOU HANDLED IT FAIRLY
WELL
WE HAD ALL RISEN TO OUR FEET OUR PRISONER BREATHING HARD WITH A
STALWART CONSTABLE ON EACH SIDE OF HIM ALREADY A FEW LOITERERS HAD
BEGUN TO COLLECT IN THE STREET HOLMES STEPPED UP TO THE WINDOW
CLOSED IT AND DROPPED THE BLINDS LESTRADE HAD PRODUCED TWO CANDLES
AND THE POLICEMEN HAD UNCOVERED THEIR LANTERNS I WAS ABLE AT LAST TO
HAVE A GOOD LOOK AT OUR PRISONER
IT WAS A TREMENDOUSLY VIRILE AND YET SINISTER FACE WHICH WAS TURNED
TOWARDS US WITH THE BROW OF A PHILOSOPHER ABOVE AND THE JAW OF A
SENSUALIST BELOW THE MAN MUST HAVE STARTED WITH GREAT CAPACITIES FOR
GOOD OR FOR EVIL BUT ONE COULD NOT LOOK UPON HIS CRUEL BLUE EYES
WITH THEIR DROOPING CYNICAL LIDS OR UPON THE FIERCE AGGRESSIVE
NOSE AND THE THREATENING DEEPLINED BROW WITHOUT READING NATURES
PLAINEST DANGERSIGNALS HE TOOK NO HEED OF ANY OF US BUT HIS EYES
WERE FIXED UPON HOLMESS FACE WITH AN EXPRESSION IN WHICH HATRED AND
AMAZEMENT WERE EQUALLY BLENDED YOU FIEND HE KEPT ON MUTTERING
YOU CLEVER CLEVER FIEND
AH COLONEL SAID HOLMES ARRANGING HIS RUMPLED COLLAR JOURNEYS
END IN LOVERS MEETINGS AS THE OLD PLAY SAYS I DONT THINK I HAVE
HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU SINCE YOU FAVOURED ME WITH THOSE
ATTENTIONS AS I LAY ON THE LEDGE ABOVE THE REICHENBACH FALL
THE COLONEL STILL STARED AT MY FRIEND LIKE A MAN IN A TRANCE YOU
CUNNING CUNNING FIEND WAS ALL THAT HE COULD SAY
I HAVE NOT INTRODUCED YOU YET SAID HOLMES THIS GENTLEMEN IS
COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN ONCE OF HER MAJESTYS INDIAN ARMY AND THE
BEST HEAVY GAME SHOT THAT OUR EASTERN EMPIRE HAS EVER PRODUCED I
BELIEVE I AM CORRECT COLONEL IN SAYING THAT YOUR BAG OF TIGERS
STILL REMAINS UNRIVALLED
THE FIERCE OLD MAN SAID NOTHING BUT STILL GLARED AT MY COMPANION
WITH HIS SAVAGE EYES AND BRISTLING MOUSTACHE HE WAS WONDERFULLY LIKE
A TIGER HIMSELF
I WONDER THAT MY VERY SIMPLE STRATAGEM COULD DECEIVE SO OLD A
SHIKARI SAID HOLMES IT MUST BE VERY FAMILIAR TO YOU HAVE YOU NOT
TETHERED A YOUNG KID UNDER A TREE LAIN ABOVE IT WITH YOUR RIFLE AND
WAITED FOR THE BAIT TO BRING UP YOUR TIGER THIS EMPTY HOUSE IS MY
TREE AND YOU ARE MY TIGER YOU HAVE POSSIBLY HAD OTHER GUNS IN
RESERVE IN CASE THERE SHOULD BE SEVERAL TIGERS OR IN THE UNLIKELY
SUPPOSITION OF YOUR OWN AIM FAILING YOU THESE HE POINTED AROUND
ARE MY OTHER GUNS THE PARALLEL IS EXACT
COLONEL MORAN SPRANG FORWARD WITH A SNARL OF RAGE BUT THE
CONSTABLES DRAGGED HIM BACK THE FURY UPON HIS FACE WAS TERRIBLE TO
LOOK AT
I CONFESS THAT YOU HAD ONE SMALL SURPRISE FOR ME SAID HOLMES I
DID NOT ANTICIPATE THAT YOU WOULD YOURSELF MAKE USE OF THIS EMPTY
HOUSE AND THIS CONVENIENT FRONT WINDOW I HAD IMAGINED YOU AS
OPERATING FROM THE STREET WHERE MY FRIEND LESTRADE AND HIS MERRY MEN
WERE AWAITING YOU WITH THAT EXCEPTION ALL HAS GONE AS I EXPECTED
COLONEL MORAN TURNED TO THE OFFICIAL DETECTIVE
YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE JUST CAUSE FOR ARRESTING ME SAID HE BUT
AT LEAST THERE CAN BE NO REASON WHY I SHOULD SUBMIT TO THE GIBES OF
THIS PERSON IF I AM IN THE HANDS OF THE LAW LET THINGS BE DONE IN A
LEGAL WAY
WELL THATS REASONABLE ENOUGH SAID LESTRADE NOTHING FURTHER YOU
HAVE TO SAY MR HOLMES BEFORE WE GO
HOLMES HAD PICKED UP THE POWERFUL AIRGUN FROM THE FLOOR AND WAS
EXAMINING ITS MECHANISM
AN ADMIRABLE AND UNIQUE WEAPON SAID HE NOISELESS AND OF
TREMENDOUS POWER I KNEW VON HERDER THE BLIND GERMAN MECHANIC WHO
CONSTRUCTED IT TO THE ORDER OF THE LATE PROFESSOR MORIARTY FOR YEARS
I HAVE BEEN AWARE OF ITS EXISTENCE THOUGH I HAVE NEVER BEFORE HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY OF HANDLING IT I COMMEND IT VERY SPECIALLY TO YOUR
ATTENTION LESTRADE AND ALSO THE BULLETS WHICH FIT IT
YOU CAN TRUST US TO LOOK AFTER THAT MR HOLMES SAID LESTRADE AS
THE WHOLE PARTY MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR ANYTHING FURTHER TO SAY
ONLY TO ASK WHAT CHARGE YOU INTEND TO PREFER
WHAT CHARGE SIR WHY OF COURSE THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES
NOT SO LESTRADE I DO NOT PROPOSE TO APPEAR IN THE MATTER AT ALL
TO YOU AND TO YOU ONLY BELONGS THE CREDIT OF THE REMARKABLE ARREST
WHICH YOU HAVE EFFECTED YES LESTRADE I CONGRATULATE YOU WITH YOUR
USUAL HAPPY MIXTURE OF CUNNING AND AUDACITY YOU HAVE GOT HIM
GOT HIM GOT WHOM MR HOLMES
THE MAN THAT THE WHOLE FORCE HAS BEEN SEEKING IN VAINCOLONEL
SEBASTIAN MORAN WHO SHOT THE HONOURABLE RONALD ADAIR WITH AN
EXPANDING BULLET FROM AN AIRGUN THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW OF THE
SECONDFLOOR FRONT OF NO PARK LANE UPON THE TH OF LAST
MONTH THATS THE CHARGE LESTRADE AND NOW WATSON IF YOU CAN
ENDURE THE DRAUGHT FROM A BROKEN WINDOW I THINK THAT HALF AN HOUR IN
MY STUDY OVER A CIGAR MAY AFFORD YOU SOME PROFITABLE AMUSEMENT
OUR OLD CHAMBERS HAD BEEN LEFT UNCHANGED THROUGH THE SUPERVISION OF
MYCROFT HOLMES AND THE IMMEDIATE CARE OF MRS HUDSON AS I ENTERED I
SAW IT IS TRUE AN UNWONTED TIDINESS BUT THE OLD LANDMARKS WERE ALL
IN THEIR PLACE THERE WERE THE CHEMICAL CORNER AND THE ACIDSTAINED
DEALTOPPED TABLE THERE UPON A SHELF WAS THE ROW OF FORMIDABLE
SCRAPBOOKS AND BOOKS OF REFERENCE WHICH MANY OF OUR FELLOWCITIZENS
WOULD HAVE BEEN SO GLAD TO BURN THE DIAGRAMS THE VIOLINCASE AND
THE PIPERACKEVEN THE PERSIAN SLIPPER WHICH CONTAINED THE
TOBACCOALL MET MY EYES AS I GLANCED ROUND ME THERE WERE TWO
OCCUPANTS OF THE ROOMONE MRS HUDSON WHO BEAMED UPON US BOTH AS WE
ENTERED THE OTHER THE STRANGE DUMMY WHICH HAD PLAYED SO IMPORTANT A
PART IN THE EVENINGS ADVENTURES IT WAS A WAXCOLOURED MODEL OF MY
FRIEND SO ADMIRABLY DONE THAT IT WAS A PERFECT FACSIMILE IT STOOD
ON A SMALL PEDESTAL TABLE WITH AN OLD DRESSINGGOWN OF HOLMESS SO
DRAPED ROUND IT THAT THE ILLUSION FROM THE STREET WAS ABSOLUTELY
PERFECT
I HOPE YOU PRESERVED ALL PRECAUTIONS MRS HUDSON SAID HOLMES
I WENT TO IT ON MY KNEES SIR JUST AS YOU TOLD ME
EXCELLENT YOU CARRIED THE THING OUT VERY WELL DID YOU OBSERVE
WHERE THE BULLET WENT
YES SIR IM AFRAID IT HAS SPOILT YOUR BEAUTIFUL BUST FOR IT
PASSED RIGHT THROUGH THE HEAD AND FLATTENED ITSELF ON THE WALL I
PICKED IT UP FROM THE CARPET HERE IT IS
HOLMES HELD IT OUT TO ME A SOFT REVOLVER BULLET AS YOU PERCEIVE
WATSON THERES GENIUS IN THAT FOR WHO WOULD EXPECT TO FIND SUCH A
THING FIRED FROM AN AIRGUN ALL RIGHT MRS HUDSON I AM MUCH
OBLIGED FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE AND NOW WATSON LET ME SEE YOU IN YOUR
OLD SEAT ONCE MORE FOR THERE ARE SEVERAL POINTS WHICH I SHOULD LIKE
TO DISCUSS WITH YOU
HE HAD THROWN OFF THE SEEDY FROCKCOAT AND NOW HE WAS THE HOLMES OF
OLD IN THE MOUSECOLOURED DRESSINGGOWN WHICH HE TOOK FROM HIS
EFFIGY
THE OLD SHIKARIS NERVES HAVE NOT LOST THEIR STEADINESS NOR HIS EYES
THEIR KEENNESS SAID HE WITH A LAUGH AS HE INSPECTED THE SHATTERED
FOREHEAD OF HIS BUST
PLUMB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BACK OF THE HEAD AND SMACK THROUGH THE
BRAIN HE WAS THE BEST SHOT IN INDIA AND I EXPECT THAT THERE ARE FEW
BETTER IN LONDON HAVE YOU HEARD THE NAME
NO I HAVE NOT
WELL WELL SUCH IS FAME BUT THEN IF I REMEMBER ARIGHT YOU HAD
NOT HEARD THE NAME OF PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY WHO HAD ONE OF THE
GREAT BRAINS OF THE CENTURY JUST GIVE ME DOWN MY INDEX OF
BIOGRAPHIES FROM THE SHELF
HE TURNED OVER THE PAGES LAZILY LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND
BLOWING GREAT CLOUDS FROM HIS CIGAR
MY COLLECTION OF MS IS A FINE ONE SAID HE MORIARTY HIMSELF IS
ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY LETTER ILLUSTRIOUS AND HERE IS MORGAN THE
POISONER AND MERRIDEW OF ABOMINABLE MEMORY AND MATHEWS WHO KNOCKED
OUT MY LEFT CANINE IN THE WAITINGROOM AT CHARING CROSS AND
FINALLY HERE IS OUR FRIEND OF TONIGHT
HE HANDED OVER THE BOOK AND I READ
MORAN SEBASTIAN COLONEL UNEMPLOYED FORMERLY ST BENGALORE
PIONEERS BORN LONDON SON OF SIR AUGUSTUS MORAN CB ONCE
BRITISH MINISTER TO PERSIA EDUCATED ETON AND OXFORD SERVED IN
JOWAKI CAMPAIGN AFGHAN CAMPAIGN CHARASIAB DESPATCHES SHERPUR
AND CABUL AUTHOR OF HEAVY GAME OF THE WESTERN HIMALAYAS THREE
MONTHS IN THE JUNGLE ADDRESS CONDUIT STREET CLUBS THE
ANGLOINDIAN THE TANKERVILLE THE BAGATELLE CARD CLUB
ON THE MARGIN WAS WRITTEN IN HOLMESS PRECISE HAND
THE SECOND MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN LONDON
THIS IS ASTONISHING SAID I AS I HANDED BACK THE VOLUME THE
MANS CAREER IS THAT OF AN HONOURABLE SOLDIER
IT IS TRUE HOLMES ANSWERED UP TO A CERTAIN POINT HE DID WELL HE
WAS ALWAYS A MAN OF IRON NERVE AND THE STORY IS STILL TOLD IN INDIA
HOW HE CRAWLED DOWN A DRAIN AFTER A WOUNDED MANEATING TIGER THERE
ARE SOME TREES WATSON WHICH GROW TO A CERTAIN HEIGHT AND THEN
SUDDENLY DEVELOP SOME UNSIGHTLY ECCENTRICITY YOU WILL SEE IT OFTEN
IN HUMANS I HAVE A THEORY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTS IN HIS
DEVELOPMENT THE WHOLE PROCESSION OF HIS ANCESTORS AND THAT SUCH A
SUDDEN TURN TO GOOD OR EVIL STANDS FOR SOME STRONG INFLUENCE WHICH
CAME INTO THE LINE OF HIS PEDIGREE THE PERSON BECOMES AS IT WERE
THE EPITOME OF THE HISTORY OF HIS OWN FAMILY
IT IS SURELY RATHER FANCIFUL
WELL I DONT INSIST UPON IT WHATEVER THE CAUSE COLONEL MORAN
BEGAN TO GO WRONG WITHOUT ANY OPEN SCANDAL HE STILL MADE INDIA TOO
HOT TO HOLD HIM HE RETIRED CAME TO LONDON AND AGAIN ACQUIRED AN
EVIL NAME IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT HE WAS SOUGHT OUT BY PROFESSOR
MORIARTY TO WHOM FOR A TIME HE WAS CHIEF OF THE STAFF MORIARTY
SUPPLIED HIM LIBERALLY WITH MONEY AND USED HIM ONLY IN ONE OR TWO
VERY HIGHCLASS JOBS WHICH NO ORDINARY CRIMINAL COULD HAVE
UNDERTAKEN YOU MAY HAVE SOME RECOLLECTION OF THE DEATH OF MRS
STEWART OF LAUDER IN NOT WELL I AM SURE MORAN WAS AT THE
BOTTOM OF IT BUT NOTHING COULD BE PROVED SO CLEVERLY WAS THE
COLONEL CONCEALED THAT EVEN WHEN THE MORIARTY GANG WAS BROKEN UP WE
COULD NOT INCRIMINATE HIM YOU REMEMBER AT THAT DATE WHEN I CALLED
UPON YOU IN YOUR ROOMS HOW I PUT UP THE SHUTTERS FOR FEAR OF
AIRGUNS NO DOUBT YOU THOUGHT ME FANCIFUL I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT I WAS
DOING FOR I KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS REMARKABLE GUN AND I KNEW
ALSO THAT ONE OF THE BEST SHOTS IN THE WORLD WOULD BE BEHIND IT WHEN
WE WERE IN SWITZERLAND HE FOLLOWED US WITH MORIARTY AND IT WAS
UNDOUBTEDLY HE WHO GAVE ME THAT EVIL FIVE MINUTES ON THE REICHENBACH
LEDGE
YOU MAY THINK THAT I READ THE PAPERS WITH SOME ATTENTION DURING MY
SOJOURN IN FRANCE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR ANY CHANCE OF LAYING HIM BY
THE HEELS SO LONG AS HE WAS FREE IN LONDON MY LIFE WOULD REALLY NOT
HAVE BEEN WORTH LIVING NIGHT AND DAY THE SHADOW WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER
ME AND SOONER OR LATER HIS CHANCE MUST HAVE COME WHAT COULD I DO I
COULD NOT SHOOT HIM AT SIGHT OR I SHOULD MYSELF BE IN THE DOCK
THERE WAS NO USE APPEALING TO A MAGISTRATE THEY CANNOT INTERFERE ON
THE STRENGTH OF WHAT WOULD APPEAR TO THEM TO BE A WILD SUSPICION SO
I COULD DO NOTHING BUT I WATCHED THE CRIMINAL NEWS KNOWING THAT
SOONER OR LATER I SHOULD GET HIM THEN CAME THE DEATH OF THIS RONALD
ADAIR MY CHANCE HAD COME AT LAST KNOWING WHAT I DID WAS IT NOT
CERTAIN THAT COLONEL MORAN HAD DONE IT HE HAD PLAYED CARDS WITH THE
LAD HE HAD FOLLOWED HIM HOME FROM THE CLUB HE HAD SHOT HIM THROUGH
THE OPEN WINDOW THERE WAS NOT A DOUBT OF IT THE BULLETS ALONE ARE
ENOUGH TO PUT HIS HEAD IN A NOOSE I CAME OVER AT ONCE I WAS SEEN BY
THE SENTINEL WHO WOULD I KNEW DIRECT THE COLONELS ATTENTION TO MY
PRESENCE HE COULD NOT FAIL TO CONNECT MY SUDDEN RETURN WITH HIS
CRIME AND TO BE TERRIBLY ALARMED I WAS SURE THAT HE WOULD MAKE AN
ATTEMPT TO GET ME OUT OF THE WAY AT ONCE AND WOULD BRING ROUND HIS
MURDEROUS WEAPON FOR THAT PURPOSE I LEFT HIM AN EXCELLENT MARK IN
THE WINDOW AND HAVING WARNED THE POLICE THAT THEY MIGHT BE
NEEDEDBY THE WAY WATSON YOU SPOTTED THEIR PRESENCE IN THAT
DOORWAY WITH UNERRING ACCURACYI TOOK UP WHAT SEEMED TO ME TO BE A
JUDICIOUS POST FOR OBSERVATION NEVER DREAMING THAT HE WOULD CHOOSE
THE SAME SPOT FOR HIS ATTACK NOW MY DEAR WATSON DOES ANYTHING
REMAIN FOR ME TO EXPLAIN
YES SAID I YOU HAVE NOT MADE IT CLEAR WHAT WAS COLONEL MORANS
MOTIVE IN MURDERING THE HONOURABLE RONALD ADAIR
AH MY DEAR WATSON THERE WE COME INTO THOSE REALMS OF CONJECTURE
WHERE THE MOST LOGICAL MIND MAY BE AT FAULT EACH MAY FORM HIS OWN
HYPOTHESIS UPON THE PRESENT EVIDENCE AND YOURS IS AS LIKELY TO BE
CORRECT AS MINE
YOU HAVE FORMED ONE THEN
I THINK THAT IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN THE FACTS IT CAME OUT
IN EVIDENCE THAT COLONEL MORAN AND YOUNG ADAIR HAD BETWEEN THEM WON A
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY NOW MORAN UNDOUBTEDLY PLAYED FOULOF
THAT I HAVE LONG BEEN AWARE I BELIEVE THAT ON THE DAY OF THE MURDER
ADAIR HAD DISCOVERED THAT MORAN WAS CHEATING VERY LIKELY HE HAD
SPOKEN TO HIM PRIVATELY AND HAD THREATENED TO EXPOSE HIM UNLESS HE
VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED HIS MEMBERSHIP OF THE CLUB AND PROMISED NOT TO
PLAY CARDS AGAIN IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A YOUNGSTER LIKE ADAIR WOULD AT
ONCE MAKE A HIDEOUS SCANDAL BY EXPOSING A WELLKNOWN MAN SO MUCH
OLDER THAN HIMSELF PROBABLY HE ACTED AS I SUGGEST THE EXCLUSION
FROM HIS CLUBS WOULD MEAN RUIN TO MORAN WHO LIVED BY HIS ILLGOTTEN
CARD GAINS HE THEREFORE MURDERED ADAIR WHO AT THE TIME WAS
ENDEAVOURING TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH MONEY HE SHOULD HIMSELF RETURN
SINCE HE COULD NOT PROFIT BY HIS PARTNERS FOUL PLAY HE LOCKED THE
DOOR LEST THE LADIES SHOULD SURPRISE HIM AND INSIST UPON KNOWING WHAT
HE WAS DOING WITH THESE NAMES AND COINS WILL IT PASS
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU HAVE HIT UPON THE TRUTH
IT WILL BE VERIFIED OR DISPROVED AT THE TRIAL MEANWHILE COME WHAT
MAY COLONEL MORAN WILL TROUBLE US NO MORE THE FAMOUS AIRGUN OF VON
HERDER WILL EMBELLISH THE SCOTLAND YARD MUSEUM AND ONCE AGAIN MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES IS FREE TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO EXAMINING THOSE
INTERESTING LITTLE PROBLEMS WHICH THE COMPLEX LIFE OF LONDON SO
PLENTIFULLY PRESENTS
THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE CRIMINAL EXPERT SAID MR SHERLOCK
HOLMES LONDON HAS BECOME A SINGULARLY UNINTERESTING CITY SINCE THE
DEATH OF THE LATE LAMENTED PROFESSOR MORIARTY
I CAN HARDLY THINK THAT YOU WOULD FIND MANY DECENT CITIZENS TO AGREE
WITH YOU I ANSWERED
WELL WELL I MUST NOT BE SELFISH SAID HE WITH A SMILE AS HE
PUSHED BACK HIS CHAIR FROM THE BREAKFASTTABLE THE COMMUNITY IS
CERTAINLY THE GAINER AND NO ONE THE LOSER SAVE THE POOR OUTOFWORK
SPECIALIST WHOSE OCCUPATION HAS GONE WITH THAT MAN IN THE FIELD
ONES MORNING PAPER PRESENTED INFINITE POSSIBILITIES OFTEN IT WAS
ONLY THE SMALLEST TRACE WATSON THE FAINTEST INDICATION AND YET IT
WAS ENOUGH TO TELL ME THAT THE GREAT MALIGNANT BRAIN WAS THERE AS
THE GENTLEST TREMORS OF THE EDGES OF THE WEB REMIND ONE OF THE FOUL
SPIDER WHICH LURKS IN THE CENTRE PETTY THEFTS WANTON ASSAULTS
PURPOSELESS OUTRAGETO THE MAN WHO HELD THE CLUE ALL COULD BE WORKED
INTO ONE CONNECTED WHOLE TO THE SCIENTIFIC STUDENT OF THE HIGHER
CRIMINAL WORLD NO CAPITAL IN EUROPE OFFERED THE ADVANTAGES WHICH
LONDON THEN POSSESSED BUT NOW HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN
HUMOROUS DEPRECATION OF THE STATE OF THINGS WHICH HE HAD HIMSELF DONE
SO MUCH TO PRODUCE
AT THE TIME OF WHICH I SPEAK HOLMES HAD BEEN BACK FOR SOME MONTHS
AND I AT HIS REQUEST HAD SOLD MY PRACTICE AND RETURNED TO SHARE THE
OLD QUARTERS IN BAKER STREET A YOUNG DOCTOR NAMED VERNER HAD
PURCHASED MY SMALL KENSINGTON PRACTICE AND GIVEN WITH ASTONISHINGLY
LITTLE DEMUR THE HIGHEST PRICE THAT I VENTURED TO ASKAN INCIDENT
WHICH ONLY EXPLAINED ITSELF SOME YEARS LATER WHEN I FOUND THAT VERNER
WAS A DISTANT RELATION OF HOLMESS AND THAT IT WAS MY FRIEND WHO HAD
REALLY FOUND THE MONEY
OUR MONTHS OF PARTNERSHIP HAD NOT BEEN SO UNEVENTFUL AS HE HAD
STATED FOR I FIND ON LOOKING OVER MY NOTES THAT THIS PERIOD
INCLUDES THE CASE OF THE PAPERS OF EXPRESIDENT MURILLO AND ALSO THE
SHOCKING AFFAIR OF THE DUTCH STEAMSHIP FRIESLAND WHICH SO NEARLY
COST US BOTH OUR LIVES HIS COLD AND PROUD NATURE WAS ALWAYS AVERSE
HOWEVER TO ANYTHING IN THE SHAPE OF PUBLIC APPLAUSE AND HE BOUND ME
IN THE MOST STRINGENT TERMS TO SAY NO FURTHER WORD OF HIMSELF HIS
METHODS OR HIS SUCCESSESA PROHIBITION WHICH AS I HAVE EXPLAINED
HAS ONLY NOW BEEN REMOVED
MR SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR AFTER HIS WHIMSICAL
PROTEST AND WAS UNFOLDING HIS MORNING PAPER IN A LEISURELY FASHION
WHEN OUR ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY A TREMENDOUS RING AT THE BELL
FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY A HOLLOW DRUMMING SOUND AS IF SOMEONE WERE
BEATING ON THE OUTER DOOR WITH HIS FIST AS IT OPENED THERE CAME A
TUMULTUOUS RUSH INTO THE HALL RAPID FEET CLATTERED UP THE STAIR AND
AN INSTANT LATER A WILDEYED AND FRANTIC YOUNG MAN PALE
DISHEVELLED AND PALPITATING BURST INTO THE ROOM HE LOOKED FROM ONE
TO THE OTHER OF US AND UNDER OUR GAZE OF INQUIRY HE BECAME CONSCIOUS
THAT SOME APOLOGY WAS NEEDED FOR THIS UNCEREMONIOUS ENTRY
IM SORRY MR HOLMES HE CRIED YOU MUSTNT BLAME ME I AM NEARLY
MAD MR HOLMES I AM THE UNHAPPY JOHN HECTOR MCFARLANE
HE MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT AS IF THE NAME ALONE WOULD EXPLAIN BOTH HIS
VISIT AND ITS MANNER BUT I COULD SEE BY MY COMPANIONS UNRESPONSIVE
FACE THAT IT MEANT NO MORE TO HIM THAN TO ME
HAVE A CIGARETTE MR MCFARLANE SAID HE PUSHING HIS CASE ACROSS
I AM SURE THAT WITH YOUR SYMPTOMS MY FRIEND DR WATSON HERE WOULD
PRESCRIBE A SEDATIVE THE WEATHER HAS BEEN SO VERY WARM THESE LAST
FEW DAYS NOW IF YOU FEEL A LITTLE MORE COMPOSED I SHOULD BE GLAD
IF YOU WOULD SIT DOWN IN THAT CHAIR AND TELL US VERY SLOWLY AND
QUIETLY WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT YOU MENTIONED YOUR
NAME AS IF I SHOULD RECOGNISE IT BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT BEYOND THE
OBVIOUS FACTS THAT YOU ARE A BACHELOR A SOLICITOR A FREEMASON AND
AN ASTHMATIC I KNOW NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT YOU
FAMILIAR AS I WAS WITH MY FRIENDS METHODS IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR
ME TO FOLLOW HIS DEDUCTIONS AND TO OBSERVE THE UNTIDINESS OF ATTIRE
THE SHEAF OF LEGAL PAPERS THE WATCHCHARM AND THE BREATHING WHICH
HAD PROMPTED THEM OUR CLIENT HOWEVER STARED IN AMAZEMENT
YES I AM ALL THAT MR HOLMES AND IN ADDITION I AM THE MOST
UNFORTUNATE MAN AT THIS MOMENT IN LONDON FOR HEAVENS SAKE DONT
ABANDON ME MR HOLMES IF THEY COME TO ARREST ME BEFORE I HAVE
FINISHED MY STORY MAKE THEM GIVE ME TIME SO THAT I MAY TELL YOU THE
WHOLE TRUTH I COULD GO TO JAIL HAPPY IF I KNEW THAT YOU WERE WORKING
FOR ME OUTSIDE
ARREST YOU SAID HOLMES THIS IS REALLY MOST GRATIMOST
INTERESTING ON WHAT CHARGE DO YOU EXPECT TO BE ARRESTED
UPON THE CHARGE OF MURDERING MR JONAS OLDACRE OF LOWER NORWOOD
MY COMPANIONS EXPRESSIVE FACE SHOWED A SYMPATHY WHICH WAS NOT I AM
AFRAID ENTIRELY UNMIXED WITH SATISFACTION
DEAR ME SAID HE IT WAS ONLY THIS MOMENT AT BREAKFAST THAT I WAS
SAYING TO MY FRIEND DR WATSON THAT SENSATIONAL CASES HAD
DISAPPEARED OUT OF OUR PAPERS
OUR VISITOR STRETCHED FORWARD A QUIVERING HAND AND PICKED UP THE
DAILY TELEGRAPH WHICH STILL LAY UPON HOLMESS KNEE
IF YOU HAD LOOKED AT IT SIR YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN AT A GLANCE WHAT
THE ERRAND IS ON WHICH I HAVE COME TO YOU THIS MORNING I FEEL AS IF
MY NAME AND MY MISFORTUNE MUST BE IN EVERY MANS MOUTH HE TURNED IT
OVER TO EXPOSE THE CENTRAL PAGE HERE IT IS AND WITH YOUR
PERMISSION I WILL READ IT TO YOU LISTEN TO THIS MR HOLMES THE
HEADLINES ARE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT LOWER NORWOOD DISAPPEARANCE OF
A WELLKNOWN BUILDER SUSPICION OF MURDER AND ARSON A CLUE TO THE
CRIMINAL THAT IS THE CLUE WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY FOLLOWING MR
HOLMES AND I KNOW THAT IT LEADS INFALLIBLY TO ME I HAVE BEEN
FOLLOWED FROM LONDON BRIDGE STATION AND I AM SURE THAT THEY ARE ONLY
WAITING FOR THE WARRANT TO ARREST ME IT WILL BREAK MY MOTHERS
HEARTIT WILL BREAK HER HEART HE WRUNG HIS HANDS IN AN AGONY OF
APPREHENSION AND SWAYED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN HIS CHAIR
I LOOKED WITH INTEREST UPON THIS MAN WHO WAS ACCUSED OF BEING THE
PERPETRATOR OF A CRIME OF VIOLENCE HE WAS FLAXENHAIRED AND HANDSOME
IN A WASHEDOUT NEGATIVE FASHION WITH FRIGHTENED BLUE EYES AND A
CLEANSHAVEN FACE WITH A WEAK SENSITIVE MOUTH HIS AGE MAY HAVE
BEEN ABOUT TWENTYSEVEN HIS DRESS AND BEARING THAT OF A GENTLEMAN
FROM THE POCKET OF HIS LIGHT SUMMER OVERCOAT PROTRUDED THE BUNDLE OF
ENDORSED PAPERS WHICH PROCLAIMED HIS PROFESSION
WE MUST USE WHAT TIME WE HAVE SAID HOLMES WATSON WOULD YOU HAVE
THE KINDNESS TO TAKE THE PAPER AND TO READ ME THE PARAGRAPH IN
QUESTION
UNDERNEATH THE VIGOROUS HEADLINES WHICH OUR CLIENT HAD QUOTED I READ
THE FOLLOWING SUGGESTIVE NARRATIVE
LATE LAST NIGHT OR EARLY THIS MORNING AN INCIDENT OCCURRED AT
LOWER NORWOOD WHICH POINTS IT IS FEARED TO A SERIOUS CRIME MR
JONAS OLDACRE IS A WELLKNOWN RESIDENT OF THAT SUBURB WHERE HE HAS
CARRIED ON HIS BUSINESS AS A BUILDER FOR MANY YEARS MR OLDACRE IS A
BACHELOR FIFTYTWO YEARS OF AGE AND LIVES IN DEEP DENE HOUSE AT
THE SYDENHAM END OF THE ROAD OF THAT NAME HE HAS HAD THE REPUTATION
OF BEING A MAN OF ECCENTRIC HABITS SECRETIVE AND RETIRING FOR SOME
YEARS HE HAS PRACTICALLY WITHDRAWN FROM THE BUSINESS IN WHICH HE IS
SAID TO HAVE AMASSED CONSIDERABLE WEALTH A SMALL TIMBERYARD STILL
EXISTS HOWEVER AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND LAST NIGHT ABOUT
TWELVE OCLOCK AN ALARM WAS GIVEN THAT ONE OF THE STACKS WAS ON
FIRE THE ENGINES WERE SOON UPON THE SPOT BUT THE DRY WOOD BURNED
WITH GREAT FURY AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ARREST THE CONFLAGRATION
UNTIL THE STACK HAD BEEN ENTIRELY CONSUMED UP TO THIS POINT THE
INCIDENT BORE THE APPEARANCE OF AN ORDINARY ACCIDENT BUT FRESH
INDICATIONS SEEM TO POINT TO SERIOUS CRIME SURPRISE WAS EXPRESSED AT
THE ABSENCE OF THE MASTER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT FROM THE SCENE OF THE
FIRE AND AN INQUIRY FOLLOWED WHICH SHOWED THAT HE HAD DISAPPEARED
FROM THE HOUSE AN EXAMINATION OF HIS ROOM REVEALED THAT THE BED HAD
NOT BEEN SLEPT IN THAT A SAFE WHICH STOOD IN IT WAS OPEN THAT A
NUMBER OF IMPORTANT PAPERS WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE ROOM AND
FINALLY THAT THERE WERE SIGNS OF A MURDEROUS STRUGGLE SLIGHT TRACES
OF BLOOD BEING FOUND WITHIN THE ROOM AND AN OAKEN WALKINGSTICK
WHICH ALSO SHOWED STAINS OF BLOOD UPON THE HANDLE IT IS KNOWN THAT
MR JONAS OLDACRE HAD RECEIVED A LATE VISITOR IN HIS BEDROOM UPON
THAT NIGHT AND THE STICK FOUND HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE PROPERTY
OF THIS PERSON WHO IS A YOUNG LONDON SOLICITOR NAMED JOHN HECTOR
MCFARLANE JUNIOR PARTNER OF GRAHAM AND MCFARLANE OF GRESHAM
BUILDINGS EC THE POLICE BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE EVIDENCE IN THEIR
POSSESSION WHICH SUPPLIES A VERY CONVINCING MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME AND
ALTOGETHER IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED THAT SENSATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS WILL
FOLLOW
LATERIT IS RUMOURED AS WE GO TO PRESS THAT MR JOHN HECTOR
MCFARLANE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ARRESTED ON THE CHARGE OF THE MURDER OF
MR JONAS OLDACRE IT IS AT LEAST CERTAIN THAT A WARRANT HAS BEEN
ISSUED THERE HAVE BEEN FURTHER AND SINISTER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
INVESTIGATION AT NORWOOD BESIDES THE SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE IN THE ROOM
OF THE UNFORTUNATE BUILDER IT IS NOW KNOWN THAT THE FRENCH WINDOWS OF
HIS BEDROOM WHICH IS ON THE GROUND FLOOR WERE FOUND TO BE OPEN
THAT THERE WERE MARKS AS IF SOME BULKY OBJECT HAD BEEN DRAGGED ACROSS
TO THE WOODPILE AND FINALLY IT IS ASSERTED THAT CHARRED REMAINS
HAVE BEEN FOUND AMONG THE CHARCOAL ASHES OF THE FIRE THE POLICE
THEORY IS THAT A MOST SENSATIONAL CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED THAT THE
VICTIM WAS CLUBBED TO DEATH IN HIS OWN BEDROOM HIS PAPERS RIFLED
AND HIS DEAD BODY DRAGGED ACROSS TO THE WOODSTACK WHICH WAS THEN
IGNITED SO AS TO HIDE ALL TRACES OF THE CRIME THE CONDUCT OF THE
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN LEFT IN THE EXPERIENCED HANDS OF
INSPECTOR LESTRADE OF SCOTLAND YARD WHO IS FOLLOWING UP THE CLUES
WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED ENERGY AND SAGACITY
SHERLOCK HOLMES LISTENED WITH CLOSED EYES AND FINGERTIPS TOGETHER TO
THIS REMARKABLE ACCOUNT
THE CASE HAS CERTAINLY SOME POINTS OF INTEREST SAID HE IN HIS
LANGUID FASHION MAY I ASK IN THE FIRST PLACE MR MCFARLANE HOW
IT IS THAT YOU ARE STILL AT LIBERTY SINCE THERE APPEARS TO BE ENOUGH
EVIDENCE TO JUSTIFY YOUR ARREST
I LIVE AT TORRINGTON LODGE BLACKHEATH WITH MY PARENTS MR HOLMES
BUT LAST NIGHT HAVING TO DO BUSINESS VERY LATE WITH MR JONAS
OLDACRE I STAYED AT AN HOTEL IN NORWOOD AND CAME TO MY BUSINESS
FROM THERE I KNEW NOTHING OF THIS AFFAIR UNTIL I WAS IN THE TRAIN
WHEN I READ WHAT YOU HAVE JUST HEARD I AT ONCE SAW THE HORRIBLE
DANGER OF MY POSITION AND I HURRIED TO PUT THE CASE INTO YOUR HANDS
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ARRESTED EITHER AT MY CITY
OFFICE OR AT MY HOME A MAN FOLLOWED ME FROM LONDON BRIDGE STATION
AND I HAVE NO DOUBTGREAT HEAVEN WHAT IS THAT
IT WAS A CLANG OF THE BELL FOLLOWED INSTANTLY BY HEAVY STEPS UPON
THE STAIR A MOMENT LATER OUR OLD FRIEND LESTRADE APPEARED IN THE
DOORWAY OVER HIS SHOULDER I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF ONE OR TWO UNIFORMED
POLICEMEN OUTSIDE
MR JOHN HECTOR MCFARLANE SAID LESTRADE
OUR UNFORTUNATE CLIENT ROSE WITH A GHASTLY FACE
I ARREST YOU FOR THE WILFUL MURDER OF MR JONAS OLDACRE OF LOWER
NORWOOD
MCFARLANE TURNED TO US WITH A GESTURE OF DESPAIR AND SANK INTO HIS
CHAIR ONCE MORE LIKE ONE WHO IS CRUSHED
ONE MOMENT LESTRADE SAID HOLMES HALF AN HOUR MORE OR LESS CAN
MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU AND THE GENTLEMAN WAS ABOUT TO GIVE US AN
ACCOUNT OF THIS VERY INTERESTING AFFAIR WHICH MIGHT AID US IN
CLEARING IT UP
I THINK THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY IN CLEARING IT UP SAID
LESTRADE GRIMLY
NONE THE LESS WITH YOUR PERMISSION I SHOULD BE MUCH INTERESTED TO
HEAR HIS ACCOUNT
WELL MR HOLMES IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO REFUSE YOU ANYTHING FOR
YOU HAVE BEEN OF USE TO THE FORCE ONCE OR TWICE IN THE PAST AND WE
OWE YOU A GOOD TURN AT SCOTLAND YARD SAID LESTRADE AT THE SAME
TIME I MUST REMAIN WITH MY PRISONER AND I AM BOUND TO WARN HIM THAT
ANYTHING HE MAY SAY WILL APPEAR IN EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM
I WISH NOTHING BETTER SAID OUR CLIENT ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU
SHOULD HEAR AND RECOGNISE THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH
LESTRADE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH ILL GIVE YOU HALF AN HOUR SAID HE
I MUST EXPLAIN FIRST SAID MCFARLANE THAT I KNEW NOTHING OF MR
JONAS OLDACRE HIS NAME WAS FAMILIAR TO ME FOR MANY YEARS AGO MY
PARENTS WERE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM BUT THEY DRIFTED APART I WAS VERY
MUCH SURPRISED THEREFORE WHEN YESTERDAY ABOUT THREE OCLOCK IN THE
AFTERNOON HE WALKED INTO MY OFFICE IN THE CITY BUT I WAS STILL MORE
ASTONISHED WHEN HE TOLD ME THE OBJECT OF HIS VISIT HE HAD IN HIS
HAND SEVERAL SHEETS OF A NOTEBOOK COVERED WITH SCRIBBLED
WRITINGHERE THEY AREAND HE LAID THEM ON MY TABLE
HERE IS MY WILL SAID HE I WANT YOU MR MCFARLANE TO CAST IT
INTO PROPER LEGAL SHAPE I WILL SIT HERE WHILE YOU DO SO
I SET MYSELF TO COPY IT AND YOU CAN IMAGINE MY ASTONISHMENT WHEN I
FOUND THAT WITH SOME RESERVATIONS HE HAD LEFT ALL HIS PROPERTY TO
ME HE WAS A STRANGE LITTLE FERRETLIKE MAN WITH WHITE EYELASHES
AND WHEN I LOOKED UP AT HIM I FOUND HIS KEEN GREY EYES FIXED UPON ME
WITH AN AMUSED EXPRESSION I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY OWN SENSES AS I
READ THE TERMS OF THE WILL BUT HE EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS A BACHELOR
WITH HARDLY ANY LIVING RELATION THAT HE HAD KNOWN MY PARENTS IN HIS
YOUTH AND THAT HE HAD ALWAYS HEARD OF ME AS A VERY DESERVING YOUNG
MAN AND WAS ASSURED THAT HIS MONEY WOULD BE IN WORTHY HANDS OF
COURSE I COULD ONLY STAMMER OUT MY THANKS THE WILL WAS DULY
FINISHED SIGNED AND WITNESSED BY MY CLERK THIS IS IT ON THE BLUE
PAPER AND THESE SLIPS AS I HAVE EXPLAINED ARE THE ROUGH DRAFT MR
JONAS OLDACRE THEN INFORMED ME THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF
DOCUMENTSBUILDING LEASES TITLEDEEDS MORTGAGES SCRIP AND SO
FORTHWHICH IT WAS NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD SEE AND UNDERSTAND HE
SAID THAT HIS MIND WOULD NOT BE EASY UNTIL THE WHOLE THING WAS
SETTLED AND HE BEGGED ME TO COME OUT TO HIS HOUSE AT NORWOOD THAT
NIGHT BRINGING THE WILL WITH ME AND TO ARRANGE MATTERS REMEMBER
MY BOY NOT ONE WORD TO YOUR PARENTS ABOUT THE AFFAIR UNTIL
EVERYTHING IS SETTLED WE WILL KEEP IT AS A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR
THEM HE WAS VERY INSISTENT UPON THIS POINT AND MADE ME PROMISE IT
FAITHFULLY
YOU CAN IMAGINE MR HOLMES THAT I WAS NOT IN A HUMOUR TO REFUSE
HIM ANYTHING THAT HE MIGHT ASK HE WAS MY BENEFACTOR AND ALL MY
DESIRE WAS TO CARRY OUT HIS WISHES IN EVERY PARTICULAR I SENT A
TELEGRAM HOME THEREFORE TO SAY THAT I HAD IMPORTANT BUSINESS ON
HAND AND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY HOW LATE I MIGHT BE
MR OLDACRE HAD TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD LIKE ME TO HAVE SUPPER WITH HIM
AT NINE AS HE MIGHT NOT BE HOME BEFORE THAT HOUR I HAD SOME
DIFFICULTY IN FINDING HIS HOUSE HOWEVER AND IT WAS NEARLY HALFPAST
BEFORE I REACHED IT I FOUND HIM
ONE MOMENT SAID HOLMES WHO OPENED THE DOOR
A MIDDLEAGED WOMAN WHO WAS I SUPPOSE HIS HOUSEKEEPER
AND IT WAS SHE I PRESUME WHO MENTIONED YOUR NAME
EXACTLY SAID MCFARLANE
PRAY PROCEED
MCFARLANE WIPED HIS DAMP BROW AND THEN CONTINUED HIS NARRATIVE
I WAS SHOWN BY THIS WOMAN INTO A SITTINGROOM WHERE A FRUGAL SUPPER
WAS LAID OUT AFTERWARDS MR JONAS OLDACRE LED ME INTO HIS BEDROOM
IN WHICH THERE STOOD A HEAVY SAFE THIS HE OPENED AND TOOK OUT A MASS
OF DOCUMENTS WHICH WE WENT OVER TOGETHER IT WAS BETWEEN ELEVEN AND
TWELVE WHEN WE FINISHED HE REMARKED THAT WE MUST NOT DISTURB THE
HOUSEKEEPER HE SHOWED ME OUT THROUGH HIS OWN FRENCH WINDOW WHICH
HAD BEEN OPEN ALL THIS TIME
WAS THE BLIND DOWN ASKED HOLMES
I WILL NOT BE SURE BUT I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ONLY HALF DOWN YES I
REMEMBER HOW HE PULLED IT UP IN ORDER TO SWING OPEN THE WINDOW I
COULD NOT FIND MY STICK AND HE SAID NEVER MIND MY BOY I SHALL
SEE A GOOD DEAL OF YOU NOW I HOPE AND I WILL KEEP YOUR STICK UNTIL
YOU COME BACK TO CLAIM IT I LEFT HIM THERE THE SAFE OPEN AND THE
PAPERS MADE UP IN PACKETS UPON THE TABLE IT WAS SO LATE THAT I COULD
NOT GET BACK TO BLACKHEATH SO I SPENT THE NIGHT AT THE ANERLEY ARMS
AND I KNEW NOTHING MORE UNTIL I READ OF THIS HORRIBLE AFFAIR IN THE
MORNING
ANYTHING MORE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK MR HOLMES SAID
LESTRADE WHOSE EYEBROWS HAD GONE UP ONCE OR TWICE DURING THIS
REMARKABLE EXPLANATION
NOT UNTIL I HAVE BEEN TO BLACKHEATH
YOU MEAN TO NORWOOD SAID LESTRADE
OH YES NO DOUBT THAT IS WHAT I MUST HAVE MEANT SAID HOLMES WITH
HIS ENIGMATICAL SMILE LESTRADE HAD LEARNED BY MORE EXPERIENCES THAN
HE WOULD CARE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT RAZORLIKE BRAIN COULD CUT
THROUGH THAT WHICH WAS IMPENETRABLE TO HIM I SAW HIM LOOK CURIOUSLY
AT MY COMPANION
I THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU PRESENTLY MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAID HE NOW MR MCFARLANE TWO OF MY CONSTABLES
ARE AT THE DOOR AND THERE IS A FOURWHEELER WAITING THE WRETCHED
YOUNG MAN AROSE AND WITH A LAST BESEECHING GLANCE AT US WALKED FROM
THE ROOM THE OFFICERS CONDUCTED HIM TO THE CAB BUT LESTRADE
REMAINED
HOLMES HAD PICKED UP THE PAGES WHICH FORMED THE ROUGH DRAFT OF THE
WILL AND WAS LOOKING AT THEM WITH THE KEENEST INTEREST UPON HIS
FACE
THERE ARE SOME POINTS ABOUT THAT DOCUMENT LESTRADE ARE THERE NOT
SAID HE PUSHING THEM OVER
THE OFFICIAL LOOKED AT THEM WITH A PUZZLED EXPRESSION
I CAN READ THE FIRST FEW LINES AND THESE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
SECOND PAGE AND ONE OR TWO AT THE END THOSE ARE AS CLEAR AS PRINT
SAID HE BUT THE WRITING IN BETWEEN IS VERY BAD AND THERE ARE THREE
PLACES WHERE I CANNOT READ IT AT ALL
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT SAID HOLMES
WELL WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
THAT IT WAS WRITTEN IN A TRAIN THE GOOD WRITING REPRESENTS
STATIONS THE BAD WRITING MOVEMENT AND THE VERY BAD WRITING PASSING
OVER POINTS A SCIENTIFIC EXPERT WOULD PRONOUNCE AT ONCE THAT THIS
WAS DRAWN UP ON A SUBURBAN LINE SINCE NOWHERE SAVE IN THE IMMEDIATE
VICINITY OF A GREAT CITY COULD THERE BE SO QUICK A SUCCESSION OF
POINTS GRANTING THAT HIS WHOLE JOURNEY WAS OCCUPIED IN DRAWING UP
THE WILL THEN THE TRAIN WAS AN EXPRESS ONLY STOPPING ONCE BETWEEN
NORWOOD AND LONDON BRIDGE
LESTRADE BEGAN TO LAUGH
YOU ARE TOO MANY FOR ME WHEN YOU BEGIN TO GET ON YOUR THEORIES MR
HOLMES SAID HE HOW DOES THIS BEAR ON THE CASE
WELL IT CORROBORATES THE YOUNG MANS STORY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE
WILL WAS DRAWN UP BY JONAS OLDACRE IN HIS JOURNEY YESTERDAY IT IS
CURIOUSIS IT NOTTHAT A MAN SHOULD DRAW UP SO IMPORTANT A
DOCUMENT IN SO HAPHAZARD A FASHION IT SUGGESTS THAT HE DID NOT THINK
IT WAS GOING TO BE OF MUCH PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE IF A MAN DREW UP A
WILL WHICH HE DID NOT INTEND EVER TO BE EFFECTIVE HE MIGHT DO IT SO
WELL HE DREW UP HIS OWN DEATHWARRANT AT THE SAME TIME SAID
LESTRADE
OH YOU THINK SO
DONT YOU
WELL IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE BUT THE CASE IS NOT CLEAR TO ME YET
NOT CLEAR WELL IF THAT ISNT CLEAR WHAT COULD BE CLEAR HERE IS A
YOUNG MAN WHO LEARNS SUDDENLY THAT IF A CERTAIN OLDER MAN DIES HE
WILL SUCCEED TO A FORTUNE WHAT DOES HE DO HE SAYS NOTHING TO
ANYONE BUT HE ARRANGES THAT HE SHALL GO OUT ON SOME PRETEXT TO SEE
HIS CLIENT THAT NIGHT HE WAITS UNTIL THE ONLY OTHER PERSON IN THE
HOUSE IS IN BED AND THEN IN THE SOLITUDE OF A MANS ROOM HE MURDERS
HIM BURNS HIS BODY IN THE WOODPILE AND DEPARTS TO A NEIGHBOURING
HOTEL THE BLOODSTAINS IN THE ROOM AND ALSO ON THE STICK ARE VERY
SLIGHT IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE IMAGINED HIS CRIME TO BE A BLOODLESS
ONE AND HOPED THAT IF THE BODY WERE CONSUMED IT WOULD HIDE ALL
TRACES OF THE METHOD OF HIS DEATHTRACES WHICH FOR SOME REASON MUST
HAVE POINTED TO HIM IS ALL THIS NOT OBVIOUS
IT STRIKES ME MY GOOD LESTRADE AS BEING JUST A TRIFLE TOO
OBVIOUS SAID HOLMES YOU DO NOT ADD IMAGINATION TO YOUR OTHER
GREAT QUALITIES BUT IF YOU COULD FOR ONE MOMENT PUT YOURSELF IN THE
PLACE OF THIS YOUNG MAN WOULD YOU CHOOSE THE VERY NIGHT AFTER THE
WILL HAD BEEN MADE TO COMMIT YOUR CRIME WOULD IT NOT SEEM DANGEROUS
TO YOU TO MAKE SO VERY CLOSE A RELATION BETWEEN THE TWO INCIDENTS
AGAIN WOULD YOU CHOOSE AN OCCASION WHEN YOU ARE KNOWN TO BE IN THE
HOUSE WHEN A SERVANT HAS LET YOU IN AND FINALLY WOULD YOU TAKE
THE GREAT PAINS TO CONCEAL THE BODY AND YET LEAVE YOUR OWN STICK AS A
SIGN THAT YOU WERE THE CRIMINAL CONFESS LESTRADE THAT ALL THIS IS
VERY UNLIKELY
AS TO THE STICK MR HOLMES YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT A
CRIMINAL IS OFTEN FLURRIED AND DOES THINGS WHICH A COOL MAN WOULD
AVOID HE WAS VERY LIKELY AFRAID TO GO BACK TO THE ROOM GIVE ME
ANOTHER THEORY THAT WOULD FIT THE FACTS
I COULD VERY EASILY GIVE YOU HALFADOZEN SAID HOLMES HERE FOR
EXAMPLE IS A VERY POSSIBLE AND EVEN PROBABLE ONE I MAKE YOU A FREE
PRESENT OF IT THE OLDER MAN IS SHOWING DOCUMENTS WHICH ARE OF
EVIDENT VALUE A PASSING TRAMP SEES THEM THROUGH THE WINDOW THE
BLIND OF WHICH IS ONLY HALF DOWN EXIT THE SOLICITOR ENTER THE
TRAMP HE SEIZES A STICK WHICH HE OBSERVES THERE KILLS OLDACRE AND
DEPARTS AFTER BURNING THE BODY
WHY SHOULD THE TRAMP BURN THE BODY
FOR THE MATTER OF THAT WHY SHOULD MCFARLANE
TO HIDE SOME EVIDENCE
POSSIBLY THE TRAMP WANTED TO HIDE THAT ANY MURDER AT ALL HAD BEEN
COMMITTED
AND WHY DID THE TRAMP TAKE NOTHING
BECAUSE THEY WERE PAPERS THAT HE COULD NOT NEGOTIATE
LESTRADE SHOOK HIS HEAD THOUGH IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HIS MANNER WAS
LESS ABSOLUTELY ASSURED THAN BEFORE
WELL MR SHERLOCK HOLMES YOU MAY LOOK FOR YOUR TRAMP AND WHILE
YOU ARE FINDING HIM WE WILL HOLD ON TO OUR MAN THE FUTURE WILL SHOW
WHICH IS RIGHT JUST NOTICE THIS POINT MR HOLMES THAT SO FAR AS WE
KNOW NONE OF THE PAPERS WERE REMOVED AND THAT THE PRISONER IS THE
ONE MAN IN THE WORLD WHO HAD NO REASON FOR REMOVING THEM SINCE HE
WAS HEIRATLAW AND WOULD COME INTO THEM IN ANY CASE
MY FRIEND SEEMED STRUCK BY THIS REMARK
I DONT MEAN TO DENY THAT THE EVIDENCE IS IN SOME WAYS VERY STRONGLY
IN FAVOUR OF YOUR THEORY SAID HE I ONLY WISH TO POINT OUT THAT
THERE ARE OTHER THEORIES POSSIBLE AS YOU SAY THE FUTURE WILL
DECIDE GOOD MORNING I DARE SAY THAT IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY I
SHALL DROP IN AT NORWOOD AND SEE HOW YOU ARE GETTING ON
WHEN THE DETECTIVE DEPARTED MY FRIEND ROSE AND MADE HIS PREPARATIONS
FOR THE DAYS WORK WITH THE ALERT AIR OF A MAN WHO HAS A CONGENIAL
TASK BEFORE HIM
MY FIRST MOVEMENT WATSON SAID HE AS HE BUSTLED INTO HIS
FROCKCOAT MUST AS I SAID BE IN THE DIRECTION OF BLACKHEATH
AND WHY NOT NORWOOD
BECAUSE WE HAVE IN THIS CASE ONE SINGULAR INCIDENT COMING CLOSE TO
THE HEELS OF ANOTHER SINGULAR INCIDENT THE POLICE ARE MAKING THE
MISTAKE OF CONCENTRATING THEIR ATTENTION UPON THE SECOND BECAUSE IT
HAPPENS TO BE THE ONE WHICH IS ACTUALLY CRIMINAL BUT IT IS EVIDENT
TO ME THAT THE LOGICAL WAY TO APPROACH THE CASE IS TO BEGIN BY TRYING
TO THROW SOME LIGHT UPON THE FIRST INCIDENTTHE CURIOUS WILL SO
SUDDENLY MADE AND TO SO UNEXPECTED AN HEIR IT MAY DO SOMETHING TO
SIMPLIFY WHAT FOLLOWED NO MY DEAR FELLOW I DONT THINK YOU CAN
HELP ME THERE IS NO PROSPECT OF DANGER OR I SHOULD NOT DREAM OF
STIRRING OUT WITHOUT YOU I TRUST THAT WHEN I SEE YOU IN THE EVENING
I WILL BE ABLE TO REPORT THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO SOMETHING FOR
THIS UNFORTUNATE YOUNGSTER WHO HAS THROWN HIMSELF UPON MY
PROTECTION
IT WAS LATE WHEN MY FRIEND RETURNED AND I COULD SEE BY A GLANCE AT
HIS HAGGARD AND ANXIOUS FACE THAT THE HIGH HOPES WITH WHICH HE HAD
STARTED HAD NOT BEEN FULFILLED FOR AN HOUR HE DRONED AWAY UPON HIS
VIOLIN ENDEAVOURING TO SOOTHE HIS OWN RUFFLED SPIRITS AT LAST HE
FLUNG DOWN THE INSTRUMENT AND PLUNGED INTO A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HIS
MISADVENTURES
ITS ALL GOING WRONG WATSONALL AS WRONG AS IT CAN GO I KEPT A
BOLD FACE BEFORE LESTRADE BUT UPON MY SOUL I BELIEVE THAT FOR ONCE
THE FELLOW IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND WE ARE ON THE WRONG ALL MY
INSTINCTS ARE ONE WAY AND ALL THE FACTS ARE THE OTHER AND I MUCH
FEAR THAT BRITISH JURIES HAVE NOT YET ATTAINED THAT PITCH OF
INTELLIGENCE WHEN THEY WILL GIVE THE PREFERENCE TO MY THEORIES OVER
LESTRADES FACTS
DID YOU GO TO BLACKHEATH
YES WATSON I WENT THERE AND I FOUND VERY QUICKLY THAT THE LATE
LAMENTED OLDACRE WAS A PRETTY CONSIDERABLE BLACKGUARD THE FATHER
WAS AWAY IN SEARCH OF HIS SON THE MOTHER WAS AT HOMEA LITTLE
FLUFFY BLUEEYED PERSON IN A TREMOR OF FEAR AND INDIGNATION OF
COURSE SHE WOULD NOT ADMIT EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF HIS GUILT BUT
SHE WOULD NOT EXPRESS EITHER SURPRISE OR REGRET OVER THE FATE OF
OLDACRE ON THE CONTRARY SHE SPOKE OF HIM WITH SUCH BITTERNESS THAT
SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY CONSIDERABLY STRENGTHENING THE CASE OF THE
POLICE FOR OF COURSE IF HER SON HAD HEARD HER SPEAK OF THE MAN IN
THIS FASHION IT WOULD PREDISPOSE HIM TOWARDS HATRED AND VIOLENCE HE
WAS MORE LIKE A MALIGNANT AND CUNNING APE THAN A HUMAN BEING SAID
SHE AND HE ALWAYS WAS EVER SINCE HE WAS A YOUNG MAN
YOU KNEW HIM AT THAT TIME SAID I
YES I KNEW HIM WELL IN FACT HE WAS AN OLD SUITOR OF MINE THANK
HEAVEN THAT I HAD THE SENSE TO TURN AWAY FROM HIM AND TO MARRY A
BETTER IF A POORER MAN I WAS ENGAGED TO HIM MR HOLMES WHEN I
HEARD A SHOCKING STORY OF HOW HE HAD TURNED A CAT LOOSE IN AN AVIARY
AND I WAS SO HORRIFIED AT HIS BRUTAL CRUELTY THAT I WOULD HAVE
NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH HIM SHE RUMMAGED IN A BUREAU AND PRESENTLY
SHE PRODUCED A PHOTOGRAPH OF A WOMAN SHAMEFULLY DEFACED AND
MUTILATED WITH A KNIFE THAT IS MY OWN PHOTOGRAPH SHE SAID HE
SENT IT TO ME IN THAT STATE WITH HIS CURSE UPON MY WEDDING
MORNING
WELL SAID I AT LEAST HE HAS FORGIVEN YOU NOW SINCE HE HAS LEFT
ALL HIS PROPERTY TO YOUR SON
NEITHER MY SON NOR I WANT ANYTHING FROM JONAS OLDACRE DEAD OR
ALIVE SHE CRIED WITH A PROPER SPIRIT THERE IS A GOD IN HEAVEN
MR HOLMES AND THAT SAME GOD WHO HAS PUNISHED THAT WICKED MAN WILL
SHOW IN HIS OWN GOOD TIME THAT MY SONS HANDS ARE GUILTLESS OF HIS
BLOOD
WELL I TRIED ONE OR TWO LEADS BUT COULD GET AT NOTHING WHICH WOULD
HELP OUR HYPOTHESIS AND SEVERAL POINTS WHICH WOULD MAKE AGAINST IT
I GAVE IT UP AT LAST AND OFF I WENT TO NORWOOD
THIS PLACE DEEP DENE HOUSE IS A BIG MODERN VILLA OF STARING BRICK
STANDING BACK IN ITS OWN GROUNDS WITH A LAURELCLUMPED LAWN IN FRONT
OF IT TO THE RIGHT AND SOME DISTANCE BACK FROM THE ROAD WAS THE
TIMBERYARD WHICH HAD BEEN THE SCENE OF THE FIRE HERES A ROUGH PLAN
ON A LEAF OF MY NOTEBOOK THIS WINDOW ON THE LEFT IS THE ONE WHICH
OPENS INTO OLDACRES ROOM YOU CAN LOOK INTO IT FROM THE ROAD YOU
SEE THAT IS ABOUT THE ONLY BIT OF CONSOLATION I HAVE HAD TODAY
LESTRADE WAS NOT THERE BUT HIS HEAD CONSTABLE DID THE HONOURS THEY
HAD JUST MADE A GREAT TREASURETROVE THEY HAD SPENT THE MORNING
RAKING AMONG THE ASHES OF THE BURNED WOODPILE AND BESIDES THE
CHARRED ORGANIC REMAINS THEY HAD SECURED SEVERAL DISCOLOURED METAL
DISCS I EXAMINED THEM WITH CARE AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THEY
WERE TROUSER BUTTONS I EVEN DISTINGUISHED THAT ONE OF THEM WAS
MARKED WITH THE NAME OF HYAMS WHO WAS OLDACRES TAILOR I THEN
WORKED THE LAWN VERY CAREFULLY FOR SIGNS AND TRACES BUT THIS DROUGHT
HAS MADE EVERYTHING AS HARD AS IRON NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN SAVE THAT
SOME BODY OR BUNDLE HAD BEEN DRAGGED THROUGH A LOW PRIVET HEDGE WHICH
IS IN A LINE WITH THE WOODPILE ALL THAT OF COURSE FITS IN WITH
THE OFFICIAL THEORY I CRAWLED ABOUT THE LAWN WITH AN AUGUST SUN ON
MY BACK BUT I GOT UP AT THE END OF AN HOUR NO WISER THAN BEFORE
WELL AFTER THIS FIASCO I WENT INTO THE BEDROOM AND EXAMINED THAT
ALSO THE BLOODSTAINS WERE VERY SLIGHT MERE SMEARS AND
DISCOLORATIONS BUT UNDOUBTEDLY FRESH THE STICK HAD BEEN REMOVED
BUT THERE ALSO THE MARKS WERE SLIGHT THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE
STICK BELONGING TO OUR CLIENT HE ADMITS IT FOOTMARKS OF BOTH MEN
COULD BE MADE OUT ON THE CARPET BUT NONE OF ANY THIRD PERSON WHICH
AGAIN IS A TRICK FOR THE OTHER SIDE THEY WERE PILING UP THEIR SCORE
ALL THE TIME AND WE WERE AT A STANDSTILL
ONLY ONE LITTLE GLEAM OF HOPE DID I GETAND YET IT AMOUNTED TO
NOTHING I EXAMINED THE CONTENTS OF THE SAFE MOST OF WHICH HAD BEEN
TAKEN OUT AND LEFT ON THE TABLE THE PAPERS HAD BEEN MADE UP INTO
SEALED ENVELOPES ONE OR TWO OF WHICH HAD BEEN OPENED BY THE POLICE
THEY WERE NOT SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE OF ANY GREAT VALUE NOR DID
THE BANKBOOK SHOW THAT MR OLDACRE WAS IN SUCH VERY AFFLUENT
CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT ALL THE PAPERS WERE NOT
THERE THERE WERE ALLUSIONS TO SOME DEEDSPOSSIBLY THE MORE
VALUABLEWHICH I COULD NOT FIND THIS OF COURSE IF WE COULD
DEFINITELY PROVE IT WOULD TURN LESTRADES ARGUMENT AGAINST HIMSELF
FOR WHO WOULD STEAL A THING IF HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD SHORTLY INHERIT
IT
FINALLY HAVING DRAWN EVERY OTHER COVER AND PICKED UP NO SCENT I
TRIED MY LUCK WITH THE HOUSEKEEPER MRS LEXINGTON IS HER NAME A
LITTLE DARK SILENT PERSON WITH SUSPICIOUS AND SIDELONG EYES SHE
COULD TELL US SOMETHING IF SHE WOULDI AM CONVINCED OF IT BUT SHE
WAS AS CLOSE AS WAX YES SHE HAD LET MR MCFARLANE IN AT HALFPAST
NINE SHE WISHED HER HAND HAD WITHERED BEFORE SHE HAD DONE SO SHE
HAD GONE TO BED AT HALFPAST TEN HER ROOM WAS AT THE OTHER END OF
THE HOUSE AND SHE COULD HEAR NOTHING OF WHAT PASSED MR MCFARLANE
HAD LEFT HIS HAT AND TO THE BEST OF HER BELIEF HIS STICK IN THE
HALL SHE HAD BEEN AWAKENED BY THE ALARM OF FIRE HER POOR DEAR
MASTER HAD CERTAINLY BEEN MURDERED HAD HE ANY ENEMIES WELL EVERY
MAN HAD ENEMIES BUT MR OLDACRE KEPT HIMSELF VERY MUCH TO HIMSELF
AND ONLY MET PEOPLE IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS SHE HAD SEEN THE BUTTONS
AND WAS SURE THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE CLOTHES WHICH HE HAD WORN LAST
NIGHT THE WOODPILE WAS VERY DRY FOR IT HAD NOT RAINED FOR A MONTH
IT BURNED LIKE TINDER AND BY THE TIME SHE REACHED THE SPOT NOTHING
COULD BE SEEN BUT FLAMES SHE AND ALL THE FIREMEN SMELLED THE BURNED
FLESH FROM INSIDE IT SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PAPERS NOR OF MR
OLDACRES PRIVATE AFFAIRS
SO MY DEAR WATSON THERES MY REPORT OF A FAILURE AND YETAND
YETHE CLENCHED HIS THIN HANDS IN A PAROXYSM OF CONVICTIONI
KNOW ITS ALL WRONG I FEEL IT IN MY BONES THERE IS SOMETHING THAT
HAS NOT COME OUT AND THAT HOUSEKEEPER KNOWS IT THERE WAS A SORT OF
SULKY DEFIANCE IN HER EYES WHICH ONLY GOES WITH GUILTY KNOWLEDGE
HOWEVER THERES NO GOOD TALKING ANY MORE ABOUT IT WATSON BUT
UNLESS SOME LUCKY CHANCE COMES OUR WAY I FEAR THAT THE NORWOOD
DISAPPEARANCE CASE WILL NOT FIGURE IN THAT CHRONICLE OF OUR SUCCESSES
WHICH I FORESEE THAT A PATIENT PUBLIC WILL SOONER OR LATER HAVE TO
ENDURE
SURELY SAID I THE MANS APPEARANCE WOULD GO FAR WITH ANY JURY
THAT IS A DANGEROUS ARGUMENT MY DEAR WATSON YOU REMEMBER THAT
TERRIBLE MURDERER BERT STEVENS WHO WANTED US TO GET HIM OFF IN WAS
THERE EVER A MORE MILDMANNERED SUNDAYSCHOOL YOUNG MAN
IT IS TRUE
UNLESS WE SUCCEED IN ESTABLISHING AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY THIS MAN IS
LOST YOU CAN HARDLY FIND A FLAW IN THE CASE WHICH CAN NOW BE
PRESENTED AGAINST HIM AND ALL FURTHER INVESTIGATION HAS SERVED TO
STRENGTHEN IT BY THE WAY THERE IS ONE CURIOUS LITTLE POINT ABOUT
THOSE PAPERS WHICH MAY SERVE US AS THE STARTINGPOINT FOR AN INQUIRY
ON LOOKING OVER THE BANKBOOK I FOUND THAT THE LOW STATE OF THE
BALANCE WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO LARGE CHEQUES WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE OUT
DURING THE LAST YEAR TO MR CORNELIUS I CONFESS THAT I SHOULD BE
INTERESTED TO KNOW WHO THIS MR CORNELIUS MAY BE WITH WHOM A RETIRED
BUILDER HAS SUCH VERY LARGE TRANSACTIONS IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE HAS
HAD A HAND IN THE AFFAIR CORNELIUS MIGHT BE A BROKER BUT WE HAVE
FOUND NO SCRIP TO CORRESPOND WITH THESE LARGE PAYMENTS FAILING ANY
OTHER INDICATION MY RESEARCHES MUST NOW TAKE THE DIRECTION OF AN
INQUIRY AT THE BANK FOR THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS CASHED THESE CHEQUES
BUT I FEAR MY DEAR FELLOW THAT OUR CASE WILL END INGLORIOUSLY BY
LESTRADE HANGING OUR CLIENT WHICH WILL CERTAINLY BE A TRIUMPH FOR
SCOTLAND YARD
I DO NOT KNOW HOW FAR SHERLOCK HOLMES TOOK ANY SLEEP THAT NIGHT BUT
WHEN I CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST I FOUND HIM PALE AND HARASSED HIS
BRIGHT EYES THE BRIGHTER FOR THE DARK SHADOWS ROUND THEM THE CARPET
ROUND HIS CHAIR WAS LITTERED WITH CIGARETTEENDS AND WITH THE EARLY
EDITIONS OF THE MORNING PAPERS AN OPEN TELEGRAM LAY UPON THE TABLE
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS WATSON HE ASKED TOSSING IT ACROSS
IT WAS FROM NORWOOD AND RAN AS FOLLOWS
IMPORTANT FRESH EVIDENCE TO HAND MCFARLANES GUILT DEFINITELY
ESTABLISHED ADVISE YOU TO ABANDON CASE
LESTRADE
THIS SOUNDS SERIOUS SAID I
IT IS LESTRADES LITTLE COCKADOODLE OF VICTORY HOLMES ANSWERED
WITH A BITTER SMILE AND YET IT MAY BE PREMATURE TO ABANDON THE
CASE AFTER ALL IMPORTANT FRESH EVIDENCE IS A TWOEDGED THING AND
MAY POSSIBLY CUT IN A VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION TO THAT WHICH LESTRADE
IMAGINES TAKE YOUR BREAKFAST WATSON AND WE WILL GO OUT TOGETHER
AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO I FEEL AS IF I SHALL NEED YOUR COMPANY AND
YOUR MORAL SUPPORT TODAY
MY FRIEND HAD NO BREAKFAST HIMSELF FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS
PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT
HIMSELF NO FOOD AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH
UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION AT PRESENT I CANNOT SPARE
ENERGY AND NERVE FORCE FOR DIGESTION HE WOULD SAY IN ANSWER TO MY
MEDICAL REMONSTRANCES I WAS NOT SURPRISED THEREFORE WHEN THIS
MORNING HE LEFT HIS UNTOUCHED MEAL BEHIND HIM AND STARTED WITH ME FOR
NORWOOD A CROWD OF MORBID SIGHTSEERS WERE STILL GATHERED ROUND DEEP
DENE HOUSE WHICH WAS JUST SUCH A SUBURBAN VILLA AS I HAD PICTURED
WITHIN THE GATES LESTRADE MET US HIS FACE FLUSHED WITH VICTORY HIS
MANNER GROSSLY TRIUMPHANT
WELL MR HOLMES HAVE YOU PROVED US TO BE WRONG YET HAVE YOU FOUND
YOUR TRAMP HE CRIED
I HAVE FORMED NO CONCLUSION WHATEVER MY COMPANION ANSWERED
BUT WE FORMED OURS YESTERDAY AND NOW IT PROVES TO BE CORRECT SO
YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE BEEN A LITTLE IN FRONT OF YOU THIS
TIME MR HOLMES
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE THE AIR OF SOMETHING UNUSUAL HAVING OCCURRED
SAID HOLMES
LESTRADE LAUGHED LOUDLY
YOU DONT LIKE BEING BEATEN ANY MORE THAN THE REST OF US DO SAID
HE A MAN CANT EXPECT ALWAYS TO HAVE IT HIS OWN WAY CAN HE DR
WATSON STEP THIS WAY IF YOU PLEASE GENTLEMEN AND I THINK I CAN
CONVINCE YOU ONCE FOR ALL THAT IT WAS JOHN MCFARLANE WHO DID THIS
CRIME
HE LED US THROUGH THE PASSAGE AND OUT INTO A DARK HALL BEYOND
THIS IS WHERE YOUNG MCFARLANE MUST HAVE COME OUT TO GET HIS HAT
AFTER THE CRIME WAS DONE SAID HE NOW LOOK AT THIS WITH
DRAMATIC SUDDENNESS HE STRUCK A MATCH AND BY ITS LIGHT EXPOSED A
STAIN OF BLOOD UPON THE WHITEWASHED WALL AS HE HELD THE MATCH NEARER
I SAW THAT IT WAS MORE THAN A STAIN IT WAS THE WELLMARKED PRINT OF
A THUMB
LOOK AT THAT WITH YOUR MAGNIFYING GLASS MR HOLMES
YES I AM DOING SO
YOU ARE AWARE THAT NO TWO THUMB MARKS ARE ALIKE
I HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF THE KIND
WELL THEN WILL YOU PLEASE COMPARE THAT PRINT WITH THIS WAX
IMPRESSION OF YOUNG MCFARLANES RIGHT THUMB TAKEN BY MY ORDERS THIS
MORNING
AS HE HELD THE WAXEN PRINT CLOSE TO THE BLOODSTAIN IT DID NOT TAKE A
MAGNIFYING GLASS TO SEE THAT THE TWO WERE UNDOUBTEDLY FROM THE SAME
THUMB IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT OUR UNFORTUNATE CLIENT WAS LOST
THAT IS FINAL SAID LESTRADE
YES THAT IS FINAL I INVOLUNTARILY ECHOED
IT IS FINAL SAID HOLMES
SOMETHING IN HIS TONE CAUGHT MY EAR AND I TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM AN
EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE HAD COME OVER HIS FACE IT WAS WRITHING WITH
INWARD MERRIMENT HIS TWO EYES WERE SHINING LIKE STARS IT SEEMED TO
ME THAT HE WAS MAKING DESPERATE EFFORTS TO RESTRAIN A CONVULSIVE
ATTACK OF LAUGHTER
DEAR ME DEAR ME HE SAID AT LAST WELL NOW WHO WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT IT AND HOW DECEPTIVE APPEARANCES MAY BE TO BE SURE SUCH A
NICE YOUNG MAN TO LOOK AT IT IS A LESSON TO US NOT TO TRUST OUR OWN
JUDGMENT IS IT NOT LESTRADE
YES SOME OF US ARE A LITTLE TOO MUCH INCLINED TO BE COCKSURE MR
HOLMES SAID LESTRADE THE MANS INSOLENCE WAS MADDENING BUT WE
COULD NOT RESENT IT
WHAT A PROVIDENTIAL THING THAT THIS YOUNG MAN SHOULD PRESS HIS RIGHT
THUMB AGAINST THE WALL IN TAKING HIS HAT FROM THE PEG SUCH A VERY
NATURAL ACTION TOO IF YOU COME TO THINK OF IT HOLMES WAS
OUTWARDLY CALM BUT HIS WHOLE BODY GAVE A WRIGGLE OF SUPPRESSED
EXCITEMENT AS HE SPOKE BY THE WAY LESTRADE WHO MADE THIS
REMARKABLE DISCOVERY
IT WAS THE HOUSEKEEPER MRS LEXINGTON WHO DREW THE NIGHT
CONSTABLES ATTENTION TO IT
WHERE WAS THE NIGHT CONSTABLE
HE REMAINED ON GUARD IN THE BEDROOM WHERE THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED
SO AS TO SEE THAT NOTHING WAS TOUCHED
BUT WHY DIDNT THE POLICE SEE THIS MARK YESTERDAY
WELL WE HAD NO PARTICULAR REASON TO MAKE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF
THE HALL BESIDES ITS NOT IN A VERY PROMINENT PLACE AS YOU SEE
NO NO OF COURSE NOT I SUPPOSE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE MARK WAS
THERE YESTERDAY
LESTRADE LOOKED AT HOLMES AS IF HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING OUT OF HIS
MIND I CONFESS THAT I WAS MYSELF SURPRISED BOTH AT HIS HILARIOUS
MANNER AND AT HIS RATHER WILD OBSERVATION
I DONT KNOW WHETHER YOU THINK THAT MCFARLANE CAME OUT OF JAIL IN
THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE EVIDENCE AGAINST
HIMSELF SAID LESTRADE I LEAVE IT TO ANY EXPERT IN THE WORLD
WHETHER THAT IS NOT THE MARK OF HIS THUMB
IT IS UNQUESTIONABLY THE MARK OF HIS THUMB
THERE THATS ENOUGH SAID LESTRADE I AM A PRACTICAL MAN MR
HOLMES AND WHEN I HAVE GOT MY EVIDENCE I COME TO MY CONCLUSIONS IF
YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY YOU WILL FIND ME WRITING MY REPORT IN THE
SITTINGROOM
HOLMES HAD RECOVERED HIS EQUANIMITY THOUGH I STILL SEEMED TO DETECT
GLEAMS OF AMUSEMENT IN HIS EXPRESSION
DEAR ME THIS IS A VERY SAD DEVELOPMENT WATSON IS IT NOT SAID
HE AND YET THERE ARE SINGULAR POINTS ABOUT IT WHICH HOLD OUT SOME
HOPES FOR OUR CLIENT
I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT SAID I HEARTILY I WAS AFRAID IT WAS
ALL UP WITH HIM
I WOULD HARDLY GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT MY DEAR WATSON THE FACT IS
THAT THERE IS ONE REALLY SERIOUS FLAW IN THIS EVIDENCE TO WHICH OUR
FRIEND ATTACHES SO MUCH IMPORTANCE
INDEED HOLMES WHAT IS IT
ONLY THIS THAT I KNOW THAT THAT MARK WAS NOT THERE WHEN I EXAMINED
THE HALL YESTERDAY AND NOW WATSON LET US HAVE A LITTLE STROLL
ROUND IN THE SUNSHINE
WITH A CONFUSED BRAIN BUT WITH A HEART INTO WHICH SOME WARMTH OF
HOPE WAS RETURNING I ACCOMPANIED MY FRIEND IN A WALK ROUND THE
GARDEN HOLMES TOOK EACH FACE OF THE HOUSE IN TURN AND EXAMINED IT
WITH GREAT INTEREST HE THEN LED THE WAY INSIDE AND WENT OVER THE
WHOLE BUILDING FROM BASEMENT TO ATTICS MOST OF THE ROOMS WERE
UNFURNISHED BUT NONE THE LESS HOLMES INSPECTED THEM ALL MINUTELY
FINALLY ON THE TOP CORRIDOR WHICH RAN OUTSIDE THREE UNTENANTED
BEDROOMS HE AGAIN WAS SEIZED WITH A SPASM OF MERRIMENT
THERE ARE REALLY SOME VERY UNIQUE FEATURES ABOUT THIS CASE WATSON
SAID HE I THINK IT IS TIME NOW THAT WE TOOK OUR FRIEND LESTRADE
INTO OUR CONFIDENCE HE HAS HAD HIS LITTLE SMILE AT OUR EXPENSE AND
PERHAPS WE MAY DO AS MUCH BY HIM IF MY READING OF THIS PROBLEM PROVES
TO BE CORRECT YES YES I THINK I SEE HOW WE SHOULD APPROACH IT
THE SCOTLAND YARD INSPECTOR WAS STILL WRITING IN THE PARLOUR WHEN
HOLMES INTERRUPTED HIM
I UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU WERE WRITING A REPORT OF THIS CASE SAID HE
SO I AM
DONT YOU THINK IT MAY BE A LITTLE PREMATURE I CANT HELP THINKING
THAT YOUR EVIDENCE IS NOT COMPLETE
LESTRADE KNEW MY FRIEND TOO WELL TO DISREGARD HIS WORDS HE LAID DOWN
HIS PEN AND LOOKED CURIOUSLY AT HIM
WHAT DO YOU MEAN MR HOLMES
ONLY THAT THERE IS AN IMPORTANT WITNESS WHOM YOU HAVE NOT SEEN
CAN YOU PRODUCE HIM
I THINK I CAN
THEN DO SO
I WILL DO MY BEST HOW MANY CONSTABLES HAVE YOU
THERE ARE THREE WITHIN CALL
EXCELLENT SAID HOLMES MAY I ASK IF THEY ARE ALL LARGE
ABLEBODIED MEN WITH POWERFUL VOICES
I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY ARE THOUGH I FAIL TO SEE WHAT THEIR VOICES
HAVE TO DO WITH IT
PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU TO SEE THAT AND ONE OR TWO OTHER THINGS AS
WELL SAID HOLMES KINDLY SUMMON YOUR MEN AND I WILL TRY
FIVE MINUTES LATER THREE POLICEMEN HAD ASSEMBLED IN THE HALL
IN THE OUTHOUSE YOU WILL FIND A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF STRAW
SAID HOLMES I WILL ASK YOU TO CARRY IN TWO BUNDLES OF IT I THINK
IT WILL BE OF THE GREATEST ASSISTANCE IN PRODUCING THE WITNESS WHOM I
REQUIRE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOME MATCHES IN YOUR
POCKET WATSON NOW MR LESTRADE I WILL ASK YOU ALL TO ACCOMPANY ME
TO THE TOP LANDING
AS I HAVE SAID THERE WAS A BROAD CORRIDOR THERE WHICH RAN OUTSIDE
THREE EMPTY BEDROOMS AT ONE END OF THE CORRIDOR WE WERE ALL
MARSHALLED BY SHERLOCK HOLMES THE CONSTABLES GRINNING AND LESTRADE
STARING AT MY FRIEND WITH AMAZEMENT EXPECTATION AND DERISION
CHASING EACH OTHER ACROSS HIS FEATURES HOLMES STOOD BEFORE US WITH
THE AIR OF A CONJURER WHO IS PERFORMING A TRICK
WOULD YOU KINDLY SEND ONE OF YOUR CONSTABLES FOR TWO BUCKETS OF
WATER PUT THE STRAW ON THE FLOOR HERE FREE FROM THE WALL ON EITHER
SIDE NOW I THINK THAT WE ARE ALL READY
LESTRADES FACE HAD BEGUN TO GROW RED AND ANGRY
I DONT KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE PLAYING A GAME WITH US MR SHERLOCK
HOLMES SAID HE IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING YOU CAN SURELY SAY IT
WITHOUT ALL THIS TOMFOOLERY
I ASSURE YOU MY GOOD LESTRADE THAT I HAVE AN EXCELLENT REASON FOR
EVERYTHING THAT I DO YOU MAY POSSIBLY REMEMBER THAT YOU CHAFFED ME A
LITTLE SOME HOURS AGO WHEN THE SUN SEEMED ON YOUR SIDE OF THE HEDGE
SO YOU MUST NOT GRUDGE ME A LITTLE POMP AND CEREMONY NOW MIGHT I ASK
YOU WATSON TO OPEN THAT WINDOW AND THEN TO PUT A MATCH TO THE EDGE
OF THE STRAW
I DID SO AND DRIVEN BY THE DRAUGHT A COIL OF GREY SMOKE SWIRLED
DOWN THE CORRIDOR WHILE THE DRY STRAW CRACKLED AND FLAMED
NOW WE MUST SEE IF WE CAN FIND THIS WITNESS FOR YOU LESTRADE MIGHT
I ASK YOU ALL TO JOIN IN THE CRY OF FIRE NOW THEN ONE TWO
THREE
FIRE WE ALL YELLED
THANK YOU I WILL TROUBLE YOU ONCE AGAIN
FIRE
JUST ONCE MORE GENTLEMEN AND ALL TOGETHER
FIRE THE SHOUT MUST HAVE RUNG OVER NORWOOD
IT HAD HARDLY DIED AWAY WHEN AN AMAZING THING HAPPENED A DOOR
SUDDENLY FLEW OPEN OUT OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE SOLID WALL AT THE END
OF THE CORRIDOR AND A LITTLE WIZENED MAN DARTED OUT OF IT LIKE A
RABBIT OUT OF ITS BURROW
CAPITAL SAID HOLMES CALMLY WATSON A BUCKET OF WATER OVER THE
STRAW THAT WILL DO LESTRADE ALLOW ME TO PRESENT YOU WITH YOUR
PRINCIPAL MISSING WITNESS MR JONAS OLDACRE
THE DETECTIVE STARED AT THE NEWCOMER WITH BLANK AMAZEMENT THE
LATTER WAS BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE CORRIDOR AND PEERING
AT US AND AT THE SMOULDERING FIRE IT WAS AN ODIOUS FACECRAFTY
VICIOUS MALIGNANT WITH SHIFTY LIGHTGREY EYES AND WHITE EYELASHES
WHATS THIS THEN SAID LESTRADE AT LAST WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING
ALL THIS TIME EH
OLDACRE GAVE AN UNEASY LAUGH SHRINKING BACK FROM THE FURIOUS RED
FACE OF THE ANGRY DETECTIVE
I HAVE DONE NO HARM
NO HARM YOU HAVE DONE YOUR BEST TO GET AN INNOCENT MAN HANGED IF
IT WASNT FOR THIS GENTLEMAN HERE I AM NOT SURE THAT YOU WOULD NOT
HAVE SUCCEEDED
THE WRETCHED CREATURE BEGAN TO WHIMPER
I AM SURE SIR IT WAS ONLY MY PRACTICAL JOKE
OH A JOKE WAS IT YOU WONT FIND THE LAUGH ON YOUR SIDE I PROMISE
YOU TAKE HIM DOWN AND KEEP HIM IN THE SITTINGROOM UNTIL I COME MR
HOLMES HE CONTINUED WHEN THEY HAD GONE I COULD NOT SPEAK BEFORE
THE CONSTABLES BUT I DONT MIND SAYING IN THE PRESENCE OF DR
WATSON THAT THIS IS THE BRIGHTEST THING THAT YOU HAVE DONE YET
THOUGH IT IS A MYSTERY TO ME HOW YOU DID IT YOU HAVE SAVED AN
INNOCENT MANS LIFE AND YOU HAVE PREVENTED A VERY GRAVE SCANDAL
WHICH WOULD HAVE RUINED MY REPUTATION IN THE FORCE
HOLMES SMILED AND CLAPPED LESTRADE UPON THE SHOULDER
INSTEAD OF BEING RUINED MY GOOD SIR YOU WILL FIND THAT YOUR
REPUTATION HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY ENHANCED JUST MAKE A FEW ALTERATIONS
IN THAT REPORT WHICH YOU WERE WRITING AND THEY WILL UNDERSTAND HOW
HARD IT IS TO THROW DUST IN THE EYES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE
AND YOU DONT WANT YOUR NAME TO APPEAR
NOT AT ALL THE WORK IS ITS OWN REWARD PERHAPS I SHALL GET THE
CREDIT ALSO AT SOME DISTANT DAY WHEN I PERMIT MY ZEALOUS HISTORIAN TO
LAY OUT HIS FOOLSCAP ONCE MOREEH WATSON WELL NOW LET US SEE
WHERE THIS RAT HAS BEEN LURKING
A LATHANDPLASTER PARTITION HAD BEEN RUN ACROSS THE PASSAGE SIX FEET
FROM THE END WITH A DOOR CUNNINGLY CONCEALED IN IT IT WAS LIT
WITHIN BY SLITS UNDER THE EAVES A FEW ARTICLES OF FURNITURE AND A
SUPPLY OF FOOD AND WATER WERE WITHIN TOGETHER WITH A NUMBER OF BOOKS
AND PAPERS
THERES THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A BUILDER SAID HOLMES AS WE CAME
OUT HE WAS ABLE TO FIX UP HIS OWN LITTLE HIDINGPLACE WITHOUT ANY
CONFEDERATESAVE OF COURSE THAT PRECIOUS HOUSEKEEPER OF HIS WHOM
I SHOULD LOSE NO TIME IN ADDING TO YOUR BAG LESTRADE
ILL TAKE YOUR ADVICE BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW OF THIS PLACE MR
HOLMES
I MADE UP MY MIND THAT THE FELLOW WAS IN HIDING IN THE HOUSE WHEN I
PACED ONE CORRIDOR AND FOUND IT SIX FEET SHORTER THAN THE
CORRESPONDING ONE BELOW IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR WHERE HE WAS I THOUGHT
HE HAD NOT THE NERVE TO LIE QUIET BEFORE AN ALARM OF FIRE WE COULD
OF COURSE HAVE GONE IN AND TAKEN HIM BUT IT AMUSED ME TO MAKE HIM
REVEAL HIMSELF BESIDES I OWED YOU A LITTLE MYSTIFICATION LESTRADE
FOR YOUR CHAFF IN THE MORNING
WELL SIR YOU CERTAINLY GOT EQUAL WITH ME ON THAT BUT HOW IN THE
WORLD DID YOU KNOW THAT HE WAS IN THE HOUSE AT ALL
THE THUMBMARK LESTRADE YOU SAID IT WAS FINAL AND SO IT WAS IN A
VERY DIFFERENT SENSE I KNEW IT HAD NOT BEEN THERE THE DAY BEFORE I
PAY A GOOD DEAL OF ATTENTION TO MATTERS OF DETAIL AS YOU MAY HAVE
OBSERVED AND I HAD EXAMINED THE HALL AND WAS SURE THAT THE WALL WAS
CLEAR THEREFORE IT HAD BEEN PUT ON DURING THE NIGHT
BUT HOW
VERY SIMPLY WHEN THOSE PACKETS WERE SEALED UP JONAS OLDACRE GOT
MCFARLANE TO SECURE ONE OF THE SEALS BY PUTTING HIS THUMB UPON THE
SOFT WAX IT WOULD BE DONE SO QUICKLY AND SO NATURALLY THAT I DARE
SAY THE YOUNG MAN HIMSELF HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF IT VERY LIKELY IT
JUST SO HAPPENED AND OLDACRE HAD HIMSELF NO NOTION OF THE USE HE
WOULD PUT IT TO BROODING OVER THE CASE IN THAT DEN OF HIS IT
SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM WHAT ABSOLUTELY DAMNING EVIDENCE HE COULD MAKE
AGAINST MCFARLANE BY USING THAT THUMBMARK IT WAS THE SIMPLEST THING
IN THE WORLD FOR HIM TO TAKE A WAX IMPRESSION FROM THE SEAL TO
MOISTEN IT IN AS MUCH BLOOD AS HE COULD GET FROM A PINPRICK AND TO
PUT THE MARK UPON THE WALL DURING THE NIGHT EITHER WITH HIS OWN HAND
OR WITH THAT OF HIS HOUSEKEEPER IF YOU EXAMINE AMONG THOSE DOCUMENTS
WHICH HE TOOK WITH HIM INTO HIS RETREAT I WILL LAY YOU A WAGER THAT
YOU FIND THE SEAL WITH THE THUMBMARK UPON IT
WONDERFUL SAID LESTRADE WONDERFUL ITS ALL AS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL
AS YOU PUT IT BUT WHAT IS THE OBJECT OF THIS DEEP DECEPTION MR
HOLMES
IT WAS AMUSING TO ME TO SEE HOW THE DETECTIVES OVERBEARING MANNER
HAD CHANGED SUDDENLY TO THAT OF A CHILD ASKING QUESTIONS OF ITS
TEACHER
WELL I DONT THINK THAT IS VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN A VERY DEEP
MALICIOUS VINDICTIVE PERSON IS THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS NOW AWAITING US
DOWNSTAIRS YOU KNOW THAT HE WAS ONCE REFUSED BY MCFARLANES MOTHER
YOU DONT I TOLD YOU THAT YOU SHOULD GO TO BLACKHEATH FIRST AND
NORWOOD AFTERWARDS WELL THIS INJURY AS HE WOULD CONSIDER IT HAS
RANKLED IN HIS WICKED SCHEMING BRAIN AND ALL HIS LIFE HE HAS LONGED
FOR VENGEANCE BUT NEVER SEEN HIS CHANCE DURING THE LAST YEAR OR TWO
THINGS HAVE GONE AGAINST HIMSECRET SPECULATION I THINKAND HE
FINDS HIMSELF IN A BAD WAY HE DETERMINES TO SWINDLE HIS CREDITORS
AND FOR THIS PURPOSE HE PAYS LARGE CHEQUES TO A CERTAIN MR
CORNELIUS WHO IS I IMAGINE HIMSELF UNDER ANOTHER NAME I HAVE NOT
TRACED THESE CHEQUES YET BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY WERE BANKED
UNDER THAT NAME AT SOME PROVINCIAL TOWN WHERE OLDACRE FROM TIME TO
TIME LED A DOUBLE EXISTENCE HE INTENDED TO CHANGE HIS NAME
ALTOGETHER DRAW THIS MONEY AND VANISH STARTING LIFE AGAIN
ELSEWHERE
WELL THATS LIKELY ENOUGH
IT WOULD STRIKE HIM THAT IN DISAPPEARING HE MIGHT THROW ALL PURSUIT
OFF HIS TRACK AND AT THE SAME TIME HAVE AN AMPLE AND CRUSHING
REVENGE UPON HIS OLD SWEETHEART IF HE COULD GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT
HE HAD BEEN MURDERED BY HER ONLY CHILD IT WAS A MASTERPIECE OF
VILLAINY AND HE CARRIED IT OUT LIKE A MASTER THE IDEA OF THE WILL
WHICH WOULD GIVE AN OBVIOUS MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME THE SECRET VISIT
UNKNOWN TO HIS OWN PARENTS THE RETENTION OF THE STICK THE BLOOD
AND THE ANIMAL REMAINS AND BUTTONS IN THE WOODPILE ALL WERE
ADMIRABLE IT WAS A NET FROM WHICH IT SEEMED TO ME A FEW HOURS AGO
THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE ESCAPE BUT HE HAD NOT THAT SUPREME GIFT
OF THE ARTIST THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHEN TO STOP HE WISHED TO IMPROVE
THAT WHICH WAS ALREADY PERFECTTO DRAW THE ROPE TIGHTER YET ROUND
THE NECK OF HIS UNFORTUNATE VICTIMAND SO HE RUINED ALL LET US
DESCEND LESTRADE THERE ARE JUST ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD
ASK HIM
THE MALIGNANT CREATURE WAS SEATED IN HIS OWN PARLOUR WITH A POLICEMAN
UPON EACH SIDE OF HIM
IT WAS A JOKE MY GOOD SIR A PRACTICAL JOKE NOTHING MORE HE
WHINED INCESSANTLY I ASSURE YOU SIR THAT I SIMPLY CONCEALED
MYSELF IN ORDER TO SEE THE EFFECT OF MY DISAPPEARANCE AND I AM SURE
THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE SO UNJUST AS TO IMAGINE THAT I WOULD HAVE
ALLOWED ANY HARM TO BEFALL POOR YOUNG MR MCFARLANE
THATS FOR A JURY TO DECIDE SAID LESTRADE ANYHOW WE SHALL HAVE
YOU ON A CHARGE OF CONSPIRACY IF NOT FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER
AND YOULL PROBABLY FIND THAT YOUR CREDITORS WILL IMPOUND THE
BANKING ACCOUNT OF MR CORNELIUS SAID HOLMES
THE LITTLE MAN STARTED AND TURNED HIS MALIGNANT EYES UPON MY FRIEND
I HAVE TO THANK YOU FOR A GOOD DEAL SAID HE PERHAPS ILL PAY MY
DEBT SOME DAY
HOLMES SMILED INDULGENTLY
I FANCY THAT FOR SOME FEW YEARS YOU WILL FIND YOUR TIME VERY FULLY
OCCUPIED SAID HE BY THE WAY WHAT WAS IT YOU PUT INTO THE
WOODPILE BESIDES YOUR OLD TROUSERS A DEAD DOG OR RABBITS OR WHAT
YOU WONT TELL DEAR ME HOW VERY UNKIND OF YOU WELL WELL I DARE
SAY THAT A COUPLE OF RABBITS WOULD ACCOUNT BOTH FOR THE BLOOD AND FOR
THE CHARRED ASHES IF EVER YOU WRITE AN ACCOUNT WATSON YOU CAN MAKE
RABBITS SERVE YOUR TURN
THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN
HOLMES HAD BEEN SEATED FOR SOME HOURS IN SILENCE WITH HIS LONG THIN
BACK CURVED OVER A CHEMICAL VESSEL IN WHICH HE WAS BREWING A
PARTICULARLY MALODOROUS PRODUCT HIS HEAD WAS SUNK UPON HIS BREAST
AND HE LOOKED FROM MY POINT OF VIEW LIKE A STRANGE LANK BIRD WITH
DULL GREY PLUMAGE AND A BLACK TOPKNOT
SO WATSON SAID HE SUDDENLY YOU DO NOT PROPOSE TO INVEST IN
SOUTH AFRICAN SECURITIES
I GAVE A START OF ASTONISHMENT ACCUSTOMED AS I WAS TO HOLMESS
CURIOUS FACULTIES THIS SUDDEN INTRUSION INTO MY MOST INTIMATE
THOUGHTS WAS UTTERLY INEXPLICABLE
HOW ON EARTH DO YOU KNOW THAT I ASKED
HE WHEELED ROUND UPON HIS STOOL WITH A STEAMING TESTTUBE IN HIS
HAND AND A GLEAM OF AMUSEMENT IN HIS DEEPSET EYES
NOW WATSON CONFESS YOURSELF UTTERLY TAKEN ABACK SAID HE
I AM
I OUGHT TO MAKE YOU SIGN A PAPER TO THAT EFFECT
WHY
BECAUSE IN FIVE MINUTES YOU WILL SAY THAT IT IS ALL SO ABSURDLY
SIMPLE
I AM SURE THAT I SHALL SAY NOTHING OF THE KIND
YOU SEE MY DEAR WATSONHE PROPPED HIS TESTTUBE IN THE RACK AND
BEGAN TO LECTURE WITH THE AIR OF A PROFESSOR ADDRESSING HIS
CLASSIT IS NOT REALLY DIFFICULT TO CONSTRUCT A SERIES OF
INFERENCES EACH DEPENDENT UPON ITS PREDECESSOR AND EACH SIMPLE IN
ITSELF IF AFTER DOING SO ONE SIMPLY KNOCKS OUT ALL THE CENTRAL
INFERENCES AND PRESENTS ONES AUDIENCE WITH THE STARTINGPOINT AND
THE CONCLUSION ONE MAY PRODUCE A STARTLING THOUGH POSSIBLY A
MERETRICIOUS EFFECT NOW IT WAS NOT REALLY DIFFICULT BY AN
INSPECTION OF THE GROOVE BETWEEN YOUR LEFT FOREFINGER AND THUMB TO
FEEL SURE THAT YOU DID NOT PROPOSE TO INVEST YOUR SMALL CAPITAL IN
THE GOLDFIELDS
I SEE NO CONNECTION
VERY LIKELY NOT BUT I CAN QUICKLY SHOW YOU A CLOSE CONNECTION HERE
ARE THE MISSING LINKS OF THE VERY SIMPLE CHAIN YOU HAD CHALK
BETWEEN YOUR LEFT FINGER AND THUMB WHEN YOU RETURNED FROM THE CLUB
LAST NIGHT YOU PUT CHALK THERE WHEN YOU PLAY BILLIARDS TO STEADY
THE CUE YOU NEVER PLAY BILLIARDS EXCEPT WITH THURSTON YOU
TOLD ME FOUR WEEKS AGO THAT THURSTON HAD AN OPTION ON SOME SOUTH
AFRICAN PROPERTY WHICH WOULD EXPIRE IN A MONTH AND WHICH HE DESIRED
YOU TO SHARE WITH HIM YOUR CHEQUEBOOK IS LOCKED IN MY DRAWER
AND YOU HAVE NOT ASKED FOR THE KEY YOU DO NOT PROPOSE TO INVEST
YOUR MONEY IN THIS MANNER
HOW ABSURDLY SIMPLE I CRIED
QUITE SO SAID HE A LITTLE NETTLED EVERY PROBLEM BECOMES VERY
CHILDISH WHEN ONCE IT IS EXPLAINED TO YOU HERE IS AN UNEXPLAINED
ONE SEE WHAT YOU CAN MAKE OF THAT FRIEND WATSON HE TOSSED A SHEET
OF PAPER UPON THE TABLE AND TURNED ONCE MORE TO HIS CHEMICAL
ANALYSIS
I LOOKED WITH AMAZEMENT AT THE ABSURD HIEROGLYPHICS UPON THE PAPER
WHY HOLMES IT IS A CHILDS DRAWING I CRIED
OH THATS YOUR IDEA
WHAT ELSE SHOULD IT BE
THAT IS WHAT MR HILTON CUBITT OF RIDLING THORPE MANOR NORFOLK IS
VERY ANXIOUS TO KNOW THIS LITTLE CONUNDRUM CAME BY THE FIRST POST
AND HE WAS TO FOLLOW BY THE NEXT TRAIN THERES A RING AT THE BELL
WATSON I SHOULD NOT BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED IF THIS WERE HE
A HEAVY STEP WAS HEARD UPON THE STAIRS AND AN INSTANT LATER THERE
ENTERED A TALL RUDDY CLEANSHAVEN GENTLEMAN WHOSE CLEAR EYES AND
FLORID CHEEKS TOLD OF A LIFE LED FAR FROM THE FOGS OF BAKER STREET
HE SEEMED TO BRING A WHIFF OF HIS STRONG FRESH BRACING EASTCOAST
AIR WITH HIM AS HE ENTERED HAVING SHAKEN HANDS WITH EACH OF US HE
WAS ABOUT TO SIT DOWN WHEN HIS EYE RESTED UPON THE PAPER WITH THE
CURIOUS MARKINGS WHICH I HAD JUST EXAMINED AND LEFT UPON THE TABLE
WELL MR HOLMES WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE HE CRIED THEY TOLD
ME THAT YOU WERE FOND OF QUEER MYSTERIES AND I DONT THINK YOU CAN
FIND A QUEERER ONE THAN THAT I SENT THE PAPER ON AHEAD SO THAT YOU
MIGHT HAVE TIME TO STUDY IT BEFORE I CAME
IT IS CERTAINLY RATHER A CURIOUS PRODUCTION SAID HOLMES AT FIRST
SIGHT IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE SOME CHILDISH PRANK IT CONSISTS OF A
NUMBER OF ABSURD LITTLE FIGURES DANCING ACROSS THE PAPER UPON WHICH
THEY ARE DRAWN WHY SHOULD YOU ATTRIBUTE ANY IMPORTANCE TO SO
GROTESQUE AN OBJECT
I NEVER SHOULD MR HOLMES BUT MY WIFE DOES IT IS FRIGHTENING HER
TO DEATH SHE SAYS NOTHING BUT I CAN SEE TERROR IN HER EYES THATS
WHY I WANT TO SIFT THE MATTER TO THE BOTTOM
HOLMES HELD UP THE PAPER SO THAT THE SUNLIGHT SHONE FULL UPON IT IT
WAS A PAGE TORN FROM A NOTEBOOK THE MARKINGS WERE DONE IN PENCIL
AND RAN IN THIS WAY
PICTURE PICTURE OF SEVERAL FIGURES OF DANCING MEN SOME HOLDING
FLAGS HOLMES EXAMINED IT FOR SOME TIME AND THEN FOLDING IT CAREFULLY
UP
HE PLACED IT IN HIS POCKETBOOK
THIS PROMISES TO BE A MOST INTERESTING AND UNUSUAL CASE SAID HE
YOU GAVE ME A FEW PARTICULARS IN YOUR LETTER MR HILTON CUBITT BUT
I SHOULD BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WOULD KINDLY GO OVER IT ALL
AGAIN FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY FRIEND DR WATSON
IM NOT MUCH OF A STORYTELLER SAID OUR VISITOR NERVOUSLY
CLASPING AND UNCLASPING HIS GREAT STRONG HANDS YOULL JUST ASK ME
ANYTHING THAT I DONT MAKE CLEAR ILL BEGIN AT THE TIME OF MY
MARRIAGE LAST YEAR BUT I WANT TO SAY FIRST OF ALL THAT THOUGH IM
NOT A RICH MAN MY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AT RIDLING THORPE FOR A MATTER OF
FIVE CENTURIES AND THERE IS NO BETTER KNOWN FAMILY IN THE COUNTY OF
NORFOLK LAST YEAR I CAME UP TO LONDON FOR THE JUBILEE AND I STOPPED
AT A BOARDINGHOUSE IN RUSSELL SQUARE BECAUSE PARKER THE VICAR OF
OUR PARISH WAS STAYING IN IT THERE WAS AN AMERICAN YOUNG LADY
THEREPATRICK WAS THE NAMEELSIE PATRICK IN SOME WAY WE BECAME
FRIENDS UNTIL BEFORE MY MONTH WAS UP I WAS AS MUCH IN LOVE AS A MAN
COULD BE WE WERE QUIETLY MARRIED AT A REGISTRY OFFICE AND WE
RETURNED TO NORFOLK A WEDDED COUPLE YOULL THINK IT VERY MAD MR
HOLMES THAT A MAN OF A GOOD OLD FAMILY SHOULD MARRY A WIFE IN THIS
FASHION KNOWING NOTHING OF HER PAST OR OF HER PEOPLE BUT IF YOU SAW
HER AND KNEW HER IT WOULD HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND
SHE WAS VERY STRAIGHT ABOUT IT WAS ELSIE I CANT SAY THAT SHE DID
NOT GIVE ME EVERY CHANCE OF GETTING OUT OF IT IF I WISHED TO DO SO
I HAVE HAD SOME VERY DISAGREEABLE ASSOCIATIONS IN MY LIFE SAID
SHE I WISH TO FORGET ALL ABOUT THEM I WOULD RATHER NEVER ALLUDE TO
THE PAST FOR IT IS VERY PAINFUL TO ME IF YOU TAKE ME HILTON YOU
WILL TAKE A WOMAN WHO HAS NOTHING THAT SHE NEED BE PERSONALLY ASHAMED
OF BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO BE CONTENT WITH MY WORD FOR IT AND TO ALLOW
ME TO BE SILENT AS TO ALL THAT PASSED UP TO THE TIME WHEN I BECAME
YOURS IF THESE CONDITIONS ARE TOO HARD THEN GO BACK TO NORFOLK AND
LEAVE ME TO THE LONELY LIFE IN WHICH YOU FOUND ME IT WAS ONLY THE
DAY BEFORE OUR WEDDING THAT SHE SAID THOSE VERY WORDS TO ME I TOLD
HER THAT I WAS CONTENT TO TAKE HER ON HER OWN TERMS AND I HAVE BEEN
AS GOOD AS MY WORD
WELL WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED NOW FOR A YEAR AND VERY HAPPY WE HAVE
BEEN BUT ABOUT A MONTH AGO AT THE END OF JUNE I SAW FOR THE FIRST
TIME SIGNS OF TROUBLE ONE DAY MY WIFE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM
AMERICA I SAW THE AMERICAN STAMP SHE TURNED DEADLY WHITE READ THE
LETTER AND THREW IT INTO THE FIRE SHE MADE NO ALLUSION TO IT
AFTERWARDS AND I MADE NONE FOR A PROMISE IS A PROMISE BUT SHE HAS
NEVER KNOWN AN EASY HOUR FROM THAT MOMENT THERE IS ALWAYS A LOOK OF
FEAR UPON HER FACEA LOOK AS IF SHE WERE WAITING AND EXPECTING SHE
WOULD DO BETTER TO TRUST ME SHE WOULD FIND THAT I WAS HER BEST
FRIEND BUT UNTIL SHE SPEAKS I CAN SAY NOTHING MIND YOU SHE IS A
TRUTHFUL WOMAN MR HOLMES AND WHATEVER TROUBLE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
IN HER PAST LIFE IT HAS BEEN NO FAULT OF HERS I AM ONLY A SIMPLE
NORFOLK SQUIRE BUT THERE IS NOT A MAN IN ENGLAND WHO RANKS HIS
FAMILY HONOUR MORE HIGHLY THAN I DO SHE KNOWS IT WELL AND SHE KNEW
IT WELL BEFORE SHE MARRIED ME SHE WOULD NEVER BRING ANY STAIN UPON
ITOF THAT I AM SURE
WELL NOW I COME TO THE QUEER PART OF MY STORY ABOUT A WEEK AGOIT
WAS THE TUESDAY OF LAST WEEKI FOUND ON ONE OF THE WINDOWSILLS A
NUMBER OF ABSURD LITTLE DANCING FIGURES LIKE THESE UPON THE PAPER
THEY WERE SCRAWLED WITH CHALK I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS THE STABLEBOY
WHO HAD DRAWN THEM BUT THE LAD SWORE HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT
ANYHOW THEY HAD COME THERE DURING THE NIGHT I HAD THEM WASHED OUT
AND I ONLY MENTIONED THE MATTER TO MY WIFE AFTERWARDS TO MY SURPRISE
SHE TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY AND BEGGED ME IF ANY MORE CAME TO LET HER
SEE THEM NONE DID COME FOR A WEEK AND THEN YESTERDAY MORNING I
FOUND THIS PAPER LYING ON THE SUNDIAL IN THE GARDEN I SHOWED IT TO
ELSIE AND DOWN SHE DROPPED IN A DEAD FAINT SINCE THEN SHE HAS
LOOKED LIKE A WOMAN IN A DREAM HALF DAZED AND WITH TERROR ALWAYS
LURKING IN HER EYES IT WAS THEN THAT I WROTE AND SENT THE PAPER TO
YOU MR HOLMES IT WAS NOT A THING THAT I COULD TAKE TO THE POLICE
FOR THEY WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT ME BUT YOU WILL TELL ME WHAT TO DO I
AM NOT A RICH MAN BUT IF THERE IS ANY DANGER THREATENING MY LITTLE
WOMAN I WOULD SPEND MY LAST COPPER TO SHIELD HER
HE WAS A FINE CREATURE THIS MAN OF THE OLD ENGLISH SOIL SIMPLE
STRAIGHT AND GENTLE WITH HIS GREAT EARNEST BLUE EYES AND BROAD
COMELY FACE HIS LOVE FOR HIS WIFE AND HIS TRUST IN HER SHONE IN HIS
FEATURES HOLMES HAD LISTENED TO HIS STORY WITH THE UTMOST ATTENTION
AND NOW HE SAT FOR SOME TIME IN SILENT THOUGHT
DONT YOU THINK MR CUBITT SAID HE AT LAST THAT YOUR BEST PLAN
WOULD BE TO MAKE A DIRECT APPEAL TO YOUR WIFE AND TO ASK HER TO
SHARE HER SECRET WITH YOU
HILTON CUBITT SHOOK HIS MASSIVE HEAD
A PROMISE IS A PROMISE MR HOLMES IF ELSIE WISHED TO TELL ME SHE
WOULD IF NOT IT IS NOT FOR ME TO FORCE HER CONFIDENCE BUT I AM
JUSTIFIED IN TAKING MY OWN LINEAND I WILL
THEN I WILL HELP YOU WITH ALL MY HEART IN THE FIRST PLACE HAVE YOU
HEARD OF ANY STRANGERS BEING SEEN IN YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD
NO
I PRESUME THAT IT IS A VERY QUIET PLACE ANY FRESH FACE WOULD CAUSE
COMMENT
IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD YES BUT WE HAVE SEVERAL SMALL
WATERINGPLACES NOT VERY FAR AWAY AND THE FARMERS TAKE IN LODGERS
THESE HIEROGLYPHICS HAVE EVIDENTLY A MEANING IF IT IS A PURELY
ARBITRARY ONE IT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO SOLVE IT IF ON THE
OTHER HAND IT IS SYSTEMATIC I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE SHALL GET TO
THE BOTTOM OF IT BUT THIS PARTICULAR SAMPLE IS SO SHORT THAT I CAN
DO NOTHING AND THE FACTS WHICH YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME ARE SO INDEFINITE
THAT WE HAVE NO BASIS FOR AN INVESTIGATION I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU
RETURN TO NORFOLK THAT YOU KEEP A KEEN LOOKOUT AND THAT YOU TAKE
AN EXACT COPY OF ANY FRESH DANCING MEN WHICH MAY APPEAR IT IS A
THOUSAND PITIES THAT WE HAVE NOT A REPRODUCTION OF THOSE WHICH WERE
DONE IN CHALK UPON THE WINDOWSILL MAKE A DISCREET INQUIRY ALSO AS
TO ANY STRANGERS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHEN YOU HAVE COLLECTED SOME
FRESH EVIDENCE COME TO ME AGAIN THAT IS THE BEST ADVICE WHICH I CAN
GIVE YOU MR HILTON CUBITT IF THERE ARE ANY PRESSING FRESH
DEVELOPMENTS I SHALL BE ALWAYS READY TO RUN DOWN AND SEE YOU IN YOUR
NORFOLK HOME
THE INTERVIEW LEFT SHERLOCK HOLMES VERY THOUGHTFUL AND SEVERAL TIMES
IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS I SAW HIM TAKE HIS SLIP OF PAPER FROM HIS
NOTEBOOK AND LOOK LONG AND EARNESTLY AT THE CURIOUS FIGURES
INSCRIBED UPON IT HE MADE NO ALLUSION TO THE AFFAIR HOWEVER UNTIL
ONE AFTERNOON A FORTNIGHT OR SO LATER I WAS GOING OUT WHEN HE CALLED
ME BACK
YOU HAD BETTER STAY HERE WATSON
WHY
BECAUSE I HAD A WIRE FROM HILTON CUBITT THIS MORNINGYOU REMEMBER
HILTON CUBITT OF THE DANCING MEN HE WAS TO REACH LIVERPOOL STREET
AT ONETWENTY HE MAY BE HERE AT ANY MOMENT I GATHER FROM HIS WIRE
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME NEW INCIDENTS OF IMPORTANCE
WE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT FOR OUR NORFOLK SQUIRE CAME STRAIGHT FROM
THE STATION AS FAST AS A HANSOM COULD BRING HIM HE WAS LOOKING
WORRIED AND DEPRESSED WITH TIRED EYES AND A LINED FOREHEAD
ITS GETTING ON MY NERVES THIS BUSINESS MR HOLMES SAID HE AS
HE SANK LIKE A WEARIED MAN INTO AN ARMCHAIR ITS BAD ENOUGH TO
FEEL THAT YOU ARE SURROUNDED BY UNSEEN UNKNOWN FOLK WHO HAVE SOME
KIND OF DESIGN UPON YOU BUT WHEN IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU KNOW THAT
IT IS JUST KILLING YOUR WIFE BY INCHES THEN IT BECOMES AS MUCH AS
FLESH AND BLOOD CAN ENDURE SHES WEARING AWAY UNDER ITJUST WEARING
AWAY BEFORE MY EYES
HAS SHE SAID ANYTHING YET
NO MR HOLMES SHE HAS NOT AND YET THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN THE
POOR GIRL HAS WANTED TO SPEAK AND YET COULD NOT QUITE BRING HERSELF
TO TAKE THE PLUNGE I HAVE TRIED TO HELP HER BUT I DARE SAY I DID IT
CLUMSILY AND SCARED HER OFF FROM IT SHE HAS SPOKEN ABOUT MY OLD
FAMILY AND OUR REPUTATION IN THE COUNTY AND OUR PRIDE IN OUR
UNSULLIED HONOUR AND I ALWAYS FELT IT WAS LEADING TO THE POINT BUT
SOMEHOW IT TURNED OFF BEFORE WE GOT THERE
BUT YOU HAVE FOUND OUT SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF
A GOOD DEAL MR HOLMES I HAVE SEVERAL FRESH DANCING MEN PICTURES
FOR YOU TO EXAMINE AND WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT I HAVE SEEN THE
FELLOW
WHAT THE MAN WHO DRAWS THEM
YES I SAW HIM AT HIS WORK BUT I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING IN ORDER
WHEN I GOT BACK AFTER MY VISIT TO YOU THE VERY FIRST THING I SAW
NEXT MORNING WAS A FRESH CROP OF DANCING MEN THEY HAD BEEN DRAWN IN
CHALK UPON THE BLACK WOODEN DOOR OF THE TOOLHOUSE WHICH STANDS
BESIDE THE LAWN IN FULL VIEW OF THE FRONT WINDOWS I TOOK AN EXACT
COPY AND HERE IT IS HE UNFOLDED A PAPER AND LAID IT UPON THE
TABLE HERE IS A COPY OF THE HIEROGLYPHICS
PICTURE PICTURE OF A FEW DANCING MEN EXCELLENT SAID HOLMES EXCELLENT
PRAY CONTINUE
WHEN I HAD TAKEN THE COPY I RUBBED OUT THE MARKS BUT TWO MORNINGS
LATER A FRESH INSCRIPTION HAD APPEARED I HAVE A COPY OF IT HERE
PICTURE PICTURE OF SOME MORE DANCING MAN FIGURES HOLMES RUBBED HIS
HANDS AND CHUCKLED WITH DELIGHT
OUR MATERIAL IS RAPIDLY ACCUMULATING SAID HE
THREE DAYS LATER A MESSAGE WAS LEFT SCRAWLED UPON PAPER AND PLACED
UNDER A PEBBLE UPON THE SUNDIAL HERE IT IS THE CHARACTERS ARE AS
YOU SEE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE LAST ONE AFTER THAT I DETERMINED TO
LIE IN WAIT SO I GOT OUT MY REVOLVER AND I SAT UP IN MY STUDY WHICH
OVERLOOKS THE LAWN AND GARDEN ABOUT TWO IN THE MORNING I WAS SEATED
BY THE WINDOW ALL BEING DARK SAVE FOR THE MOONLIGHT OUTSIDE WHEN I
HEARD STEPS BEHIND ME AND THERE WAS MY WIFE IN HER DRESSINGGOWN
SHE IMPLORED ME TO COME TO BED I TOLD HER FRANKLY THAT I WISHED TO
SEE WHO IT WAS WHO PLAYED SUCH ABSURD TRICKS UPON US SHE ANSWERED
THAT IT WAS SOME SENSELESS PRACTICAL JOKE AND THAT I SHOULD NOT TAKE
ANY NOTICE OF IT
IF IT REALLY ANNOYS YOU HILTON WE MIGHT GO AND TRAVEL YOU AND I
AND SO AVOID THIS NUISANCE
WHAT BE DRIVEN OUT OF OUR OWN HOUSE BY A PRACTICAL JOKER SAID I
WHY WE SHOULD HAVE THE WHOLE COUNTY LAUGHING AT US
WELL COME TO BED SAID SHE AND WE CAN DISCUSS IT IN THE
MORNING
SUDDENLY AS SHE SPOKE I SAW HER WHITE FACE GROW WHITER YET IN THE
MOONLIGHT AND HER HAND TIGHTENED UPON MY SHOULDER SOMETHING WAS
MOVING IN THE SHADOW OF THE TOOLHOUSE I SAW A DARK CREEPING FIGURE
WHICH CRAWLED ROUND THE CORNER AND SQUATTED IN FRONT OF THE DOOR
SEIZING MY PISTOL I WAS RUSHING OUT WHEN MY WIFE THREW HER ARMS
ROUND ME AND HELD ME WITH CONVULSIVE STRENGTH I TRIED TO THROW HER
OFF BUT SHE CLUNG TO ME MOST DESPERATELY AT LAST I GOT CLEAR BUT
BY THE TIME I HAD OPENED THE DOOR AND REACHED THE HOUSE THE CREATURE
WAS GONE HE HAD LEFT A TRACE OF HIS PRESENCE HOWEVER FOR THERE ON
THE DOOR WAS THE VERY SAME ARRANGEMENT OF DANCING MEN WHICH HAD
ALREADY TWICE APPEARED AND WHICH I HAVE COPIED ON THAT PAPER THERE
WAS NO OTHER SIGN OF THE FELLOW ANYWHERE THOUGH I RAN ALL OVER THE
GROUNDS AND YET THE AMAZING THING IS THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE
ALL THE TIME FOR WHEN I EXAMINED THE DOOR AGAIN IN THE MORNING HE
HAD SCRAWLED SOME MORE OF HIS PICTURES UNDER THE LINE WHICH I HAD
ALREADY SEEN
HAVE YOU THAT FRESH DRAWING
YES IT IS VERY SHORT BUT I MADE A COPY OF IT AND HERE IT IS
AGAIN HE PRODUCED A PAPER THE NEW DANCE WAS IN THIS FORM
PICTURE PICTURE OF FIVE DANCING MEN FIGURES TELL ME SAID HOLMESAND I
COULD SEE BY HIS EYES THAT HE WAS MUCH
EXCITEDWAS THIS A MERE ADDITION TO THE FIRST OR DID IT APPEAR TO
BE ENTIRELY SEPARATE
IT WAS ON A DIFFERENT PANEL OF THE DOOR
EXCELLENT THIS IS FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL FOR OUR PURPOSE IT
FILLS ME WITH HOPES NOW MR HILTON CUBITT PLEASE CONTINUE YOUR
MOST INTERESTING STATEMENT
I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY MR HOLMES EXCEPT THAT I WAS ANGRY WITH
MY WIFE THAT NIGHT FOR HAVING HELD ME BACK WHEN I MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT
THE SKULKING RASCAL SHE SAID THAT SHE FEARED THAT I MIGHT COME TO
HARM FOR AN INSTANT IT HAD CROSSED MY MIND THAT PERHAPS WHAT SHE
REALLY FEARED WAS THAT HE MIGHT COME TO HARM FOR I COULD NOT DOUBT
THAT SHE KNEW WHO THIS MAN WAS AND WHAT HE MEANT BY THESE STRANGE
SIGNALS BUT THERE IS A TONE IN MY WIFES VOICE MR HOLMES AND A
LOOK IN HER EYES WHICH FORBID DOUBT AND I AM SURE THAT IT WAS INDEED
MY OWN SAFETY THAT WAS IN HER MIND THERES THE WHOLE CASE AND NOW I
WANT YOUR ADVICE AS TO WHAT I OUGHT TO DO MY OWN INCLINATION IS TO
PUT HALFADOZEN OF MY FARM LADS IN THE SHRUBBERY AND WHEN THIS
FELLOW COMES AGAIN TO GIVE HIM SUCH A HIDING THAT HE WILL LEAVE US IN
PEACE FOR THE FUTURE
I FEAR IT IS TOO DEEP A CASE FOR SUCH SIMPLE REMEDIES SAID HOLMES
HOW LONG CAN YOU STAY IN LONDON
I MUST GO BACK TODAY I WOULD NOT LEAVE MY WIFE ALONE ALL NIGHT FOR
ANYTHING SHE IS VERY NERVOUS AND BEGGED ME TO COME BACK
I DARE SAY YOU ARE RIGHT BUT IF YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED I MIGHT
POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RETURN WITH YOU IN A DAY OR TWO MEANWHILE
YOU WILL LEAVE ME THESE PAPERS AND I THINK THAT IT IS VERY LIKELY
THAT I SHALL BE ABLE TO PAY YOU A VISIT SHORTLY AND TO THROW SOME
LIGHT UPON YOUR CASE
SHERLOCK HOLMES PRESERVED HIS CALM PROFESSIONAL MANNER UNTIL OUR
VISITOR HAD LEFT US ALTHOUGH IT WAS EASY FOR ME WHO KNEW HIM SO
WELL TO SEE THAT HE WAS PROFOUNDLY EXCITED THE MOMENT THAT HILTON
CUBITTS BROAD BACK HAD DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE DOOR MY COMRADE
RUSHED TO THE TABLE LAID OUT ALL THE SLIPS OF PAPER CONTAINING
DANCING MEN IN FRONT OF HIM AND THREW HIMSELF INTO AN INTRICATE AND
ELABORATE CALCULATION FOR TWO HOURS I WATCHED HIM AS HE COVERED
SHEET AFTER SHEET OF PAPER WITH FIGURES AND LETTERS SO COMPLETELY
ABSORBED IN HIS TASK THAT HE HAD EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN MY PRESENCE
SOMETIMES HE WAS MAKING PROGRESS AND WHISTLED AND SANG AT HIS WORK
SOMETIMES HE WAS PUZZLED AND WOULD SIT FOR LONG SPELLS WITH A
FURROWED BROW AND A VACANT EYE FINALLY HE SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR WITH
A CRY OF SATISFACTION AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM RUBBING HIS
HANDS TOGETHER THEN HE WROTE A LONG TELEGRAM UPON A CABLE FORM IF
MY ANSWER TO THIS IS AS I HOPE YOU WILL HAVE A VERY PRETTY CASE TO
ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION WATSON SAID HE I EXPECT THAT WE SHALL BE
ABLE TO GO DOWN TO NORFOLK TOMORROW AND TO TAKE OUR FRIEND SOME
VERY DEFINITE NEWS AS TO THE SECRET OF HIS ANNOYANCE
I CONFESS THAT I WAS FILLED WITH CURIOSITY BUT I WAS AWARE THAT
HOLMES LIKED TO MAKE HIS DISCLOSURES AT HIS OWN TIME AND IN HIS OWN
WAY SO I WAITED UNTIL IT SHOULD SUIT HIM TO TAKE ME INTO HIS
CONFIDENCE
BUT THERE WAS A DELAY IN THAT ANSWERING TELEGRAM AND TWO DAYS OF
IMPATIENCE FOLLOWED DURING WHICH HOLMES PRICKED UP HIS EARS AT EVERY
RING OF THE BELL ON THE EVENING OF THE SECOND THERE CAME A LETTER
FROM HILTON CUBITT ALL WAS QUIET WITH HIM SAVE THAT A LONG
INSCRIPTION HAD APPEARED THAT MORNING UPON THE PEDESTAL OF THE
SUNDIAL HE INCLOSED A COPY OF IT WHICH IS HERE REPRODUCED
PICTURE PICTURE OF MANY DANCING MEN FIGURES HOLMES BENT OVER THIS
GROTESQUE FRIEZE FOR SOME MINUTES AND THEN
SUDDENLY SPRANG TO HIS FEET WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF SURPRISE AND
DISMAY HIS FACE WAS HAGGARD WITH ANXIETY
WE HAVE LET THIS AFFAIR GO FAR ENOUGH SAID HE IS THERE A TRAIN
TO NORTH WALSHAM TONIGHT
I TURNED UP THE TIMETABLE THE LAST HAD JUST GONE
THEN WE SHALL BREAKFAST EARLY AND TAKE THE VERY FIRST IN THE
MORNING SAID HOLMES OUR PRESENCE IS MOST URGENTLY NEEDED AH
HERE IS OUR EXPECTED CABLEGRAM ONE MOMENT MRS HUDSON THERE MAY BE
AN ANSWER NO THAT IS QUITE AS I EXPECTED THIS MESSAGE MAKES IT
EVEN MORE ESSENTIAL THAT WE SHOULD NOT LOSE AN HOUR IN LETTING HILTON
CUBITT KNOW HOW MATTERS STAND FOR IT IS A SINGULAR AND A DANGEROUS
WEB IN WHICH OUR SIMPLE NORFOLK SQUIRE IS ENTANGLED
SO INDEED IT PROVED AND AS I COME TO THE DARK CONCLUSION OF A
STORY WHICH HAD SEEMED TO ME TO BE ONLY CHILDISH AND BIZARRE I
EXPERIENCE ONCE AGAIN THE DISMAY AND HORROR WITH WHICH I WAS FILLED
WOULD THAT I HAD SOME BRIGHTER ENDING TO COMMUNICATE TO MY READERS
BUT THESE ARE THE CHRONICLES OF FACT AND I MUST FOLLOW TO THEIR DARK
CRISIS THE STRANGE CHAIN OF EVENTS WHICH FOR SOME DAYS MADE RIDLING
THORPE MANOR A HOUSEHOLD WORD THROUGH THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF
ENGLAND
WE HAD HARDLY ALIGHTED AT NORTH WALSHAM AND MENTIONED THE NAME OF
OUR DESTINATION WHEN THE STATIONMASTER HURRIED TOWARDS US I
SUPPOSE THAT YOU ARE THE DETECTIVES FROM LONDON SAID HE
A LOOK OF ANNOYANCE PASSED OVER HOLMESS FACE
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SUCH A THING
BECAUSE INSPECTOR MARTIN FROM NORWICH HAS JUST PASSED THROUGH BUT
MAYBE YOU ARE THE SURGEONS SHES NOT DEADOR WASNT BY LAST
ACCOUNTS YOU MAY BE IN TIME TO SAVE HER YETTHOUGH IT BE FOR THE
GALLOWS
HOLMESS BROW WAS DARK WITH ANXIETY
WE ARE GOING TO RIDLING THORPE MANOR SAID HE BUT WE HAVE HEARD
NOTHING OF WHAT HAS PASSED THERE
ITS A TERRIBLE BUSINESS SAID THE STATIONMASTER THEY ARE SHOT
BOTH MR HILTON CUBITT AND HIS WIFE SHE SHOT HIM AND THEN
HERSELFSO THE SERVANTS SAY HES DEAD AND HER LIFE IS DESPAIRED OF
DEAR DEAR ONE OF THE OLDEST FAMILIES IN THE COUNTY OF NORFOLK AND
ONE OF THE MOST HONOURED
WITHOUT A WORD HOLMES HURRIED TO A CARRIAGE AND DURING THE LONG
SEVEN MILES DRIVE HE NEVER OPENED HIS MOUTH SELDOM HAVE I SEEN HIM
SO UTTERLY DESPONDENT HE HAD BEEN UNEASY DURING ALL OUR JOURNEY FROM
TOWN AND I HAD OBSERVED THAT HE HAD TURNED OVER THE MORNING PAPERS
WITH ANXIOUS ATTENTION BUT NOW THIS SUDDEN REALIZATION OF HIS WORST
FEARS LEFT HIM IN A BLANK MELANCHOLY HE LEANED BACK IN HIS SEAT
LOST IN GLOOMY SPECULATION YET THERE WAS MUCH AROUND TO INTEREST US
FOR WE WERE PASSING THROUGH AS SINGULAR A COUNTRYSIDE AS ANY IN
ENGLAND WHERE A FEW SCATTERED COTTAGES REPRESENTED THE POPULATION OF
TODAY WHILE ON EVERY HAND ENORMOUS SQUARETOWERED CHURCHES BRISTLED
UP FROM THE FLAT GREEN LANDSCAPE AND TOLD OF THE GLORY AND
PROSPERITY OF OLD EAST ANGLIA AT LAST THE VIOLET RIM OF THE GERMAN
OCEAN APPEARED OVER THE GREEN EDGE OF THE NORFOLK COAST AND THE
DRIVER POINTED WITH HIS WHIP TO TWO OLD BRICK AND TIMBER GABLES WHICH
PROJECTED FROM A GROVE OF TREES THATS RIDLING THORPE MANOR SAID
HE
AS WE DROVE UP TO THE PORTICOED FRONT DOOR I OBSERVED IN FRONT OF IT
BESIDE THE TENNIS LAWN THE BLACK TOOLHOUSE AND THE PEDESTALLED
SUNDIAL WITH WHICH WE HAD SUCH STRANGE ASSOCIATIONS A DAPPER LITTLE
MAN WITH A QUICK ALERT MANNER AND A WAXED MOUSTACHE HAD JUST
DESCENDED FROM A HIGH DOGCART HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF AS INSPECTOR
MARTIN OF THE NORFOLK CONSTABULARY AND HE WAS CONSIDERABLY
ASTONISHED WHEN HE HEARD THE NAME OF MY COMPANION
WHY MR HOLMES THE CRIME WAS ONLY COMMITTED AT THREE THIS MORNING
HOW COULD YOU HEAR OF IT IN LONDON AND GET TO THE SPOT AS SOON AS I
I ANTICIPATED IT I CAME IN THE HOPE OF PREVENTING IT
THEN YOU MUST HAVE IMPORTANT EVIDENCE OF WHICH WE ARE IGNORANT FOR
THEY WERE SAID TO BE A MOST UNITED COUPLE
I HAVE ONLY THE EVIDENCE OF THE DANCING MEN SAID HOLMES I WILL
EXPLAIN THE MATTER TO YOU LATER MEANWHILE SINCE IT IS TOO LATE TO
PREVENT THIS TRAGEDY I AM VERY ANXIOUS THAT I SHOULD USE THE
KNOWLEDGE WHICH I POSSESS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT JUSTICE BE DONE
WILL YOU ASSOCIATE ME IN YOUR INVESTIGATION OR WILL YOU PREFER THAT
I SHOULD ACT INDEPENDENTLY
I SHOULD BE PROUD TO FEEL THAT WE WERE ACTING TOGETHER MR HOLMES
SAID THE INSPECTOR EARNESTLY
IN THAT CASE I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THE EVIDENCE AND TO EXAMINE
THE PREMISES WITHOUT AN INSTANT OF UNNECESSARY DELAY
INSPECTOR MARTIN HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO ALLOW MY FRIEND TO DO THINGS
IN HIS OWN FASHION AND CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH CAREFULLY NOTING THE
RESULTS THE LOCAL SURGEON AN OLD WHITEHAIRED MAN HAD JUST COME
DOWN FROM MRS HILTON CUBITTS ROOM AND HE REPORTED THAT HER
INJURIES WERE SERIOUS BUT NOT NECESSARILY FATAL THE BULLET HAD
PASSED THROUGH THE FRONT OF HER BRAIN AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE SOME
TIME BEFORE SHE COULD REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS ON THE QUESTION OF
WHETHER SHE HAD BEEN SHOT OR HAD SHOT HERSELF HE WOULD NOT VENTURE TO
EXPRESS ANY DECIDED OPINION CERTAINLY THE BULLET HAD BEEN DISCHARGED
AT VERY CLOSE QUARTERS THERE WAS ONLY THE ONE PISTOL FOUND IN THE
ROOM TWO BARRELS OF WHICH HAD BEEN EMPTIED MR HILTON CUBITT HAD
BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE HEART IT WAS EQUALLY CONCEIVABLE THAT HE HAD
SHOT HER AND THEN HIMSELF OR THAT SHE HAD BEEN THE CRIMINAL FOR THE
REVOLVER LAY UPON THE FLOOR MIDWAY BETWEEN THEM
HAS HE BEEN MOVED ASKED HOLMES
WE HAVE MOVED NOTHING EXCEPT THE LADY WE COULD NOT LEAVE HER LYING
WOUNDED UPON THE FLOOR
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE DOCTOR
SINCE FOUR OCLOCK
ANYONE ELSE
YES THE CONSTABLE HERE
AND YOU HAVE TOUCHED NOTHING
NOTHING
YOU HAVE ACTED WITH GREAT DISCRETION WHO SENT FOR YOU
THE HOUSEMAID SAUNDERS
WAS IT SHE WHO GAVE THE ALARM
SHE AND MRS KING THE COOK
WHERE ARE THEY NOW
IN THE KITCHEN I BELIEVE
THEN I THINK WE HAD BETTER HEAR THEIR STORY AT ONCE
THE OLD HALL OAKPANELLED AND HIGHWINDOWED HAD BEEN TURNED INTO A
COURT OF INVESTIGATION HOLMES SAT IN A GREAT OLDFASHIONED CHAIR
HIS INEXORABLE EYES GLEAMING OUT OF HIS HAGGARD FACE I COULD READ IN
THEM A SET PURPOSE TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO THIS QUEST UNTIL THE CLIENT
WHOM HE HAD FAILED TO SAVE SHOULD AT LAST BE AVENGED THE TRIM
INSPECTOR MARTIN THE OLD GREYHEADED COUNTRY DOCTOR MYSELF AND A
STOLID VILLAGE POLICEMAN MADE UP THE REST OF THAT STRANGE COMPANY
THE TWO WOMEN TOLD THEIR STORY CLEARLY ENOUGH THEY HAD BEEN AROUSED
FROM THEIR SLEEP BY THE SOUND OF AN EXPLOSION WHICH HAD BEEN
FOLLOWED A MINUTE LATER BY A SECOND ONE THEY SLEPT IN ADJOINING
ROOMS AND MRS KING HAD RUSHED IN TO SAUNDERS TOGETHER THEY HAD
DESCENDED THE STAIRS THE DOOR OF THE STUDY WAS OPEN AND A CANDLE WAS
BURNING UPON THE TABLE THEIR MASTER LAY UPON HIS FACE IN THE CENTRE
OF THE ROOM HE WAS QUITE DEAD NEAR THE WINDOW HIS WIFE WAS
CROUCHING HER HEAD LEANING AGAINST THE WALL SHE WAS HORRIBLY
WOUNDED AND THE SIDE OF HER FACE WAS RED WITH BLOOD SHE BREATHED
HEAVILY BUT WAS INCAPABLE OF SAYING ANYTHING THE PASSAGE AS WELL
AS THE ROOM WAS FULL OF SMOKE AND THE SMELL OF POWDER THE WINDOW
WAS CERTAINLY SHUT AND FASTENED UPON THE INSIDE BOTH WOMEN WERE
POSITIVE UPON THE POINT THEY HAD AT ONCE SENT FOR THE DOCTOR AND FOR
THE CONSTABLE THEN WITH THE AID OF THE GROOM AND THE STABLEBOY
THEY HAD CONVEYED THEIR INJURED MISTRESS TO HER ROOM BOTH SHE AND
HER HUSBAND HAD OCCUPIED THE BED SHE WAS CLAD IN HER DRESSHE IN
HIS DRESSINGGOWN OVER HIS NIGHT CLOTHES NOTHING HAD BEEN MOVED IN
THE STUDY SO FAR AS THEY KNEW THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANY QUARREL
BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE THEY HAD ALWAYS LOOKED UPON THEM AS A VERY
UNITED COUPLE
THESE WERE THE MAIN POINTS OF THE SERVANTS EVIDENCE IN ANSWER TO
INSPECTOR MARTIN THEY WERE CLEAR THAT EVERY DOOR WAS FASTENED UPON
THE INSIDE AND THAT NO ONE COULD HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE HOUSE IN
ANSWER TO HOLMES THEY BOTH REMEMBERED THAT THEY WERE CONSCIOUS OF THE
SMELL OF POWDER FROM THE MOMENT THAT THEY RAN OUT OF THEIR ROOMS UPON
THE TOP FLOOR I COMMEND THAT FACT VERY CAREFULLY TO YOUR
ATTENTION SAID HOLMES TO HIS PROFESSIONAL COLLEAGUE AND NOW I
THINK THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION TO UNDERTAKE A THOROUGH EXAMINATION
OF THE ROOM
THE STUDY PROVED TO BE A SMALL CHAMBER LINED ON THREE SIDES WITH
BOOKS AND WITH A WRITINGTABLE FACING AN ORDINARY WINDOW WHICH
LOOKED OUT UPON THE GARDEN OUR FIRST ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO THE BODY
OF THE UNFORTUNATE SQUIRE WHOSE HUGE FRAME LAY STRETCHED ACROSS THE
ROOM HIS DISORDERED DRESS SHOWED THAT HE HAD BEEN HASTILY AROUSED
FROM SLEEP THE BULLET HAD BEEN FIRED AT HIM FROM THE FRONT AND HAD
REMAINED IN HIS BODY AFTER PENETRATING THE HEART HIS DEATH HAD
CERTAINLY BEEN INSTANTANEOUS AND PAINLESS THERE WAS NO
POWDERMARKING EITHER UPON HIS DRESSINGGOWN OR ON HIS HANDS
ACCORDING TO THE COUNTRY SURGEON THE LADY HAD STAINS UPON HER FACE
BUT NONE UPON HER HAND
THE ABSENCE OF THE LATTER MEANS NOTHING THOUGH ITS PRESENCE MAY
MEAN EVERYTHING SAID HOLMES UNLESS THE POWDER FROM A
BADLYFITTING CARTRIDGE HAPPENS TO SPURT BACKWARDS ONE MAY FIRE MANY
SHOTS WITHOUT LEAVING A SIGN I WOULD SUGGEST THAT MR CUBITTS BODY
MAY NOW BE REMOVED I SUPPOSE DOCTOR YOU HAVE NOT RECOVERED THE
BULLET WHICH WOUNDED THE LADY
A SERIOUS OPERATION WILL BE NECESSARY BEFORE THAT CAN BE DONE BUT
THERE ARE STILL FOUR CARTRIDGES IN THE REVOLVER TWO HAVE BEEN FIRED
AND TWO WOUNDS INFLICTED SO THAT EACH BULLET CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR
SO IT WOULD SEEM SAID HOLMES PERHAPS YOU CAN ACCOUNT ALSO FOR
THE BULLET WHICH HAS SO OBVIOUSLY STRUCK THE EDGE OF THE WINDOW
HE HAD TURNED SUDDENLY AND HIS LONG THIN FINGER WAS POINTING TO A
HOLE WHICH HAD BEEN DRILLED RIGHT THROUGH THE LOWER WINDOWSASH ABOUT
AN INCH ABOVE THE BOTTOM
BY GEORGE CRIED THE INSPECTOR HOW EVER DID YOU SEE THAT
BECAUSE I LOOKED FOR IT
WONDERFUL SAID THE COUNTRY DOCTOR YOU ARE CERTAINLY RIGHT SIR
THEN A THIRD SHOT HAS BEEN FIRED AND THEREFORE A THIRD PERSON MUST
HAVE BEEN PRESENT BUT WHO COULD THAT HAVE BEEN AND HOW COULD HE HAVE
GOT AWAY
THAT IS THE PROBLEM WHICH WE ARE NOW ABOUT TO SOLVE SAID SHERLOCK
HOLMES YOU REMEMBER INSPECTOR MARTIN WHEN THE SERVANTS SAID THAT
ON LEAVING THEIR ROOM THEY WERE AT ONCE CONSCIOUS OF A SMELL OF
POWDER I REMARKED THAT THE POINT WAS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ONE
YES SIR BUT I CONFESS I DID NOT QUITE FOLLOW YOU
IT SUGGESTED THAT AT THE TIME OF THE FIRING THE WINDOW AS WELL AS
THE DOOR OF THE ROOM HAD BEEN OPEN OTHERWISE THE FUMES OF POWDER
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BLOWN SO RAPIDLY THROUGH THE HOUSE A DRAUGHT IN
THE ROOM WAS NECESSARY FOR THAT BOTH DOOR AND WINDOW WERE ONLY OPEN
FOR A VERY SHORT TIME HOWEVER
HOW DO YOU PROVE THAT
BECAUSE THE CANDLE HAS NOT GUTTERED
CAPITAL CRIED THE INSPECTOR CAPITAL
FEELING SURE THAT THE WINDOW HAD BEEN OPEN AT THE TIME OF THE
TRAGEDY I CONCEIVED THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A THIRD PERSON IN THE
AFFAIR WHO STOOD OUTSIDE THIS OPENING AND FIRED THROUGH IT ANY SHOT
DIRECTED AT THIS PERSON MIGHT HIT THE SASH I LOOKED AND THERE SURE
ENOUGH WAS THE BULLET MARK
BUT HOW CAME THE WINDOW TO BE SHUT AND FASTENED
THE WOMANS FIRST INSTINCT WOULD BE TO SHUT AND FASTEN THE WINDOW
BUT HALLOA WHAT IS THIS
IT WAS A LADYS HANDBAG WHICH STOOD UPON THE STUDY TABLEA TRIM
LITTLE HANDBAG OF CROCODILESKIN AND SILVER HOLMES OPENED IT AND
TURNED THE CONTENTS OUT THERE WERE TWENTY FIFTYPOUND NOTES OF THE
BANK OF ENGLAND HELD TOGETHER BY AN INDIARUBBER BANDNOTHING ELSE
THIS MUST BE PRESERVED FOR IT WILL FIGURE IN THE TRIAL SAID
HOLMES AS HE HANDED THE BAG WITH ITS CONTENTS TO THE INSPECTOR IT
IS NOW NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO THROW SOME LIGHT UPON THIS
THIRD BULLET WHICH HAS CLEARLY FROM THE SPLINTERING OF THE WOOD
BEEN FIRED FROM INSIDE THE ROOM I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MRS KING THE
COOK AGAIN YOU SAID MRS KING THAT YOU WERE AWAKENED BY A LOUD
EXPLOSION WHEN YOU SAID THAT DID YOU MEAN THAT IT SEEMED TO YOU TO
BE LOUDER THAN THE SECOND ONE
WELL SIR IT WAKENED ME FROM MY SLEEP AND SO IT IS HARD TO JUDGE
BUT IT DID SEEM VERY LOUD
YOU DONT THINK THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TWO SHOTS FIRED ALMOST AT
THE SAME INSTANT
I AM SURE I COULDNT SAY SIR
I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY SO I RATHER THINK INSPECTOR
MARTIN THAT WE HAVE NOW EXHAUSTED ALL THAT THIS ROOM CAN TEACH US
IF YOU WILL KINDLY STEP ROUND WITH ME WE SHALL SEE WHAT FRESH
EVIDENCE THE GARDEN HAS TO OFFER
A FLOWERBED EXTENDED UP TO THE STUDY WINDOW AND WE ALL BROKE INTO
AN EXCLAMATION AS WE APPROACHED IT THE FLOWERS WERE TRAMPLED DOWN
AND THE SOFT SOIL WAS IMPRINTED ALL OVER WITH FOOTMARKS LARGE
MASCULINE FEET THEY WERE WITH PECULIARLY LONG SHARP TOES HOLMES
HUNTED ABOUT AMONG THE GRASS AND LEAVES LIKE A RETRIEVER AFTER A
WOUNDED BIRD THEN WITH A CRY OF SATISFACTION HE BENT FORWARD AND
PICKED UP A LITTLE BRAZEN CYLINDER
I THOUGHT SO SAID HE THE REVOLVER HAD AN EJECTOR AND HERE IS
THE THIRD CARTRIDGE I REALLY THINK INSPECTOR MARTIN THAT OUR CASE
IS ALMOST COMPLETE
THE COUNTRY INSPECTORS FACE HAD SHOWN HIS INTENSE AMAZEMENT AT THE
RAPID AND MASTERFUL PROGRESS OF HOLMESS INVESTIGATION AT FIRST HE
HAD SHOWN SOME DISPOSITION TO ASSERT HIS OWN POSITION BUT NOW HE WAS
OVERCOME WITH ADMIRATION AND READY TO FOLLOW WITHOUT QUESTION
WHEREVER HOLMES LED
WHOM DO YOU SUSPECT HE ASKED
ILL GO INTO THAT LATER THERE ARE SEVERAL POINTS IN THIS PROBLEM
WHICH I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU YET NOW THAT I HAVE GOT
SO FAR I HAD BEST PROCEED ON MY OWN LINES AND THEN CLEAR THE WHOLE
MATTER UP ONCE AND FOR ALL
JUST AS YOU WISH MR HOLMES SO LONG AS WE GET OUR MAN
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO MAKE MYSTERIES BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AT THE
MOMENT OF ACTION TO ENTER INTO LONG AND COMPLEX EXPLANATIONS I HAVE
THE THREADS OF THIS AFFAIR ALL IN MY HAND EVEN IF THIS LADY SHOULD
NEVER RECOVER CONSCIOUSNESS WE CAN STILL RECONSTRUCT THE EVENTS OF
LAST NIGHT AND ENSURE THAT JUSTICE BE DONE FIRST OF ALL I WISH TO
KNOW WHETHER THERE IS ANY INN IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD KNOWN AS
ELRIGES
THE SERVANTS WERE CROSSQUESTIONED BUT NONE OF THEM HAD HEARD OF
SUCH A PLACE THE STABLEBOY THREW A LIGHT UPON THE MATTER BY
REMEMBERING THAT A FARMER OF THAT NAME LIVED SOME MILES OFF IN THE
DIRECTION OF EAST RUSTON
IS IT A LONELY FARM
VERY LONELY SIR
PERHAPS THEY HAVE NOT HEARD YET OF ALL THAT HAPPENED HERE DURING THE
NIGHT
MAYBE NOT SIR
HOLMES THOUGHT FOR A LITTLE AND THEN A CURIOUS SMILE PLAYED OVER HIS
FACE
SADDLE A HORSE MY LAD SAID HE I SHALL WISH YOU TO TAKE A NOTE
TO ELRIGES FARM
HE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET THE VARIOUS SLIPS OF THE DANCING MEN WITH
THESE IN FRONT OF HIM HE WORKED FOR SOME TIME AT THE STUDYTABLE
FINALLY HE HANDED A NOTE TO THE BOY WITH DIRECTIONS TO PUT IT INTO
THE HANDS OF THE PERSON TO WHOM IT WAS ADDRESSED AND ESPECIALLY TO
ANSWER NO QUESTIONS OF ANY SORT WHICH MIGHT BE PUT TO HIM I SAW THE
OUTSIDE OF THE NOTE ADDRESSED IN STRAGGLING IRREGULAR CHARACTERS
VERY UNLIKE HOLMESS USUAL PRECISE HAND IT WAS CONSIGNED TO MR ABE
SLANEY ELRIGES FARM EAST RUSTON NORFOLK
I THINK INSPECTOR HOLMES REMARKED THAT YOU WOULD DO WELL TO
TELEGRAPH FOR AN ESCORT AS IF MY CALCULATIONS PROVE TO BE CORRECT
YOU MAY HAVE A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS PRISONER TO CONVEY TO THE
COUNTY JAIL THE BOY WHO TAKES THIS NOTE COULD NO DOUBT FORWARD YOUR
TELEGRAM IF THERE IS AN AFTERNOON TRAIN TO TOWN WATSON I THINK WE
SHOULD DO WELL TO TAKE IT AS I HAVE A CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF SOME
INTEREST TO FINISH AND THIS INVESTIGATION DRAWS RAPIDLY TO A CLOSE
WHEN THE YOUTH HAD BEEN DISPATCHED WITH THE NOTE SHERLOCK HOLMES
GAVE HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SERVANTS IF ANY VISITOR WERE TO CALL
ASKING FOR MRS HILTON CUBITT NO INFORMATION SHOULD BE GIVEN AS TO
HER CONDITION BUT HE WAS TO BE SHOWN AT ONCE INTO THE DRAWINGROOM
HE IMPRESSED THESE POINTS UPON THEM WITH THE UTMOST EARNESTNESS
FINALLY HE LED THE WAY INTO THE DRAWINGROOM WITH THE REMARK THAT THE
BUSINESS WAS NOW OUT OF OUR HANDS AND THAT WE MUST WHILE AWAY THE
TIME AS BEST WE MIGHT UNTIL WE COULD SEE WHAT WAS IN STORE FOR US
THE DOCTOR HAD DEPARTED TO HIS PATIENTS AND ONLY THE INSPECTOR AND
MYSELF REMAINED
I THINK THAT I CAN HELP YOU TO PASS AN HOUR IN AN INTERESTING AND
PROFITABLE MANNER SAID HOLMES DRAWING HIS CHAIR UP TO THE TABLE
AND SPREADING OUT IN FRONT OF HIM THE VARIOUS PAPERS UPON WHICH WERE
RECORDED THE ANTICS OF THE DANCING MEN AS TO YOU FRIEND WATSON I
OWE YOU EVERY ATONEMENT FOR HAVING ALLOWED YOUR NATURAL CURIOSITY TO
REMAIN SO LONG UNSATISFIED TO YOU INSPECTOR THE WHOLE INCIDENT MAY
APPEAL AS A REMARKABLE PROFESSIONAL STUDY I MUST TELL YOU FIRST OF
ALL THE INTERESTING CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE PREVIOUS
CONSULTATIONS WHICH MR HILTON CUBITT HAS HAD WITH ME IN BAKER
STREET HE THEN SHORTLY RECAPITULATED THE FACTS WHICH HAVE ALREADY
BEEN RECORDED I HAVE HERE IN FRONT OF ME THESE SINGULAR
PRODUCTIONS AT WHICH ONE MIGHT SMILE HAD THEY NOT PROVED THEMSELVES
TO BE THE FORERUNNERS OF SO TERRIBLE A TRAGEDY I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR
WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITINGS AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A
TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT IN WHICH I ANALYZE ONE HUNDRED
AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS BUT I CONFESS THAT THIS IS ENTIRELY NEW
TO ME THE OBJECT OF THOSE WHO INVENTED THE SYSTEM HAS APPARENTLY
BEEN TO CONCEAL THAT THESE CHARACTERS CONVEY A MESSAGE AND TO GIVE
THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE THE MERE RANDOM SKETCHES OF CHILDREN
HAVING ONCE RECOGNISED HOWEVER THAT THE SYMBOLS STOOD FOR LETTERS
AND HAVING APPLIED THE RULES WHICH GUIDE US IN ALL FORMS OF SECRET
WRITINGS THE SOLUTION WAS EASY ENOUGH THE FIRST MESSAGE SUBMITTED
TO ME WAS SO SHORT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO MORE THAN TO
SAY WITH SOME CONFIDENCE THAT THE SYMBOL
PICTURE PICTURE OF A SINGLE DANCING MAN STOOD FOR E AS YOU ARE AWARE E
IS THE MOST COMMON LETTER IN THE
ENGLISH ALPHABET AND IT PREDOMINATES TO SO MARKED AN EXTENT THAT
EVEN IN A SHORT SENTENCE ONE WOULD EXPECT TO FIND IT MOST OFTEN OUT
OF FIFTEEN SYMBOLS IN THE FIRST MESSAGE FOUR WERE THE SAME SO IT WAS
REASONABLE TO SET THIS DOWN AS E IT IS TRUE THAT IN SOME CASES THE
FIGURE WAS BEARING A FLAG AND IN SOME CASES NOT BUT IT WAS PROBABLE
FROM THE WAY IN WHICH THE FLAGS WERE DISTRIBUTED THAT THEY WERE USED
TO BREAK THE SENTENCE UP INTO WORDS I ACCEPTED THIS AS A HYPOTHESIS
AND NOTED THAT E WAS REPRESENTED BY
PICTURE PICTURE OF A SINGLE DANCING MAN BUT NOW CAME THE REAL
DIFFICULTY OF THE INQUIRY THE ORDER OF THE
ENGLISH LETTERS AFTER E IS BY NO MEANS WELL MARKED AND ANY
PREPONDERANCE WHICH MAY BE SHOWN IN AN AVERAGE OF A PRINTED SHEET MAY
BE REVERSED IN A SINGLE SHORT SENTENCE SPEAKING ROUGHLY T A O I
N S H R D AND L ARE THE NUMERICAL ORDER IN WHICH LETTERS OCCUR
BUT T A O AND I ARE VERY NEARLY ABREAST OF EACH OTHER AND IT
WOULD BE AN ENDLESS TASK TO TRY EACH COMBINATION UNTIL A MEANING WAS
ARRIVED AT I THEREFORE WAITED FOR FRESH MATERIAL IN MY SECOND
INTERVIEW WITH MR HILTON CUBITT HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE ME TWO OTHER
SHORT SENTENCES AND ONE MESSAGE WHICH APPEAREDSINCE THERE WAS NO
FLAGTO BE A SINGLE WORD HERE ARE THE SYMBOLS NOW IN THE SINGLE
WORD I HAVE ALREADY GOT THE TWO ES COMING SECOND AND FOURTH IN A
WORD OF FIVE LETTERS IT MIGHT BE SEVER OR LEVER OR NEVER
THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION THAT THE LATTER AS A REPLY TO AN APPEAL IS
FAR THE MOST PROBABLE AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES POINTED TO ITS BEING A
REPLY WRITTEN BY THE LADY ACCEPTING IT AS CORRECT WE ARE NOW ABLE
TO SAY THAT THE SYMBOLS
PICTURE PICTURE OF THREE DANCING MEN STAND RESPECTIVELY FOR N V AND R
EVEN NOW I WAS IN CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY BUT A HAPPY THOUGHT PUT
ME IN POSSESSION OF SEVERAL OTHER LETTERS IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IF
THESE APPEALS CAME AS I EXPECTED FROM SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN INTIMATE
WITH THE LADY IN HER EARLY LIFE A COMBINATION WHICH CONTAINED TWO
ES WITH THREE LETTERS BETWEEN MIGHT VERY WELL STAND FOR THE NAME
ELSIE ON EXAMINATION I FOUND THAT SUCH A COMBINATION FORMED THE
TERMINATION OF THE MESSAGE WHICH WAS THREE TIMES REPEATED IT WAS
CERTAINLY SOME APPEAL TO ELSIE IN THIS WAY I HAD GOT MY L S AND
I BUT WHAT APPEAL COULD IT BE THERE WERE ONLY FOUR LETTERS IN THE
WORD WHICH PRECEDED ELSIE AND IT ENDED IN E SURELY THE WORD MUST
BE COME I TRIED ALL OTHER FOUR LETTERS ENDING IN E BUT COULD FIND
NONE TO FIT THE CASE SO NOW I WAS IN POSSESSION OF C O AND M AND
I WAS IN A POSITION TO ATTACK THE FIRST MESSAGE ONCE MORE DIVIDING
IT INTO WORDS AND PUTTING DOTS FOR EACH SYMBOL WHICH WAS STILL
UNKNOWN SO TREATED IT WORKED OUT IN THIS FASHION
M ERE E SLNE
NOW THE FIRST LETTER CAN ONLY BE A WHICH IS A MOST USEFUL
DISCOVERY SINCE IT OCCURS NO FEWER THAN THREE TIMES IN THIS SHORT
SENTENCE AND THE H IS ALSO APPARENT IN THE SECOND WORD NOW IT
BECOMES
AM HERE AE SLANE
OR FILLING IN THE OBVIOUS VACANCIES IN THE NAME
AM HERE ABE SLANEY
I HAD SO MANY LETTERS NOW THAT I COULD PROCEED WITH CONSIDERABLE
CONFIDENCE TO THE SECOND MESSAGE WHICH WORKED OUT IN THIS FASHION
A ELRIES
HERE I COULD ONLY MAKE SENSE BY PUTTING T AND G FOR THE MISSING
LETTERS AND SUPPOSING THAT THE NAME WAS THAT OF SOME HOUSE OR INN AT
WHICH THE WRITER WAS STAYING
INSPECTOR MARTIN AND I HAD LISTENED WITH THE UTMOST INTEREST TO THE
FULL AND CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HOW MY FRIEND HAD PRODUCED RESULTS WHICH
HAD LED TO SO COMPLETE A COMMAND OVER OUR DIFFICULTIES
WHAT DID YOU DO THEN SIR ASKED THE INSPECTOR
I HAD EVERY REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT THIS ABE SLANEY WAS AN AMERICAN
SINCE ABE IS AN AMERICAN CONTRACTION AND SINCE A LETTER FROM AMERICA
HAD BEEN THE STARTINGPOINT OF ALL THE TROUBLE I HAD ALSO EVERY
CAUSE TO THINK THAT THERE WAS SOME CRIMINAL SECRET IN THE MATTER THE
LADYS ALLUSIONS TO HER PAST AND HER REFUSAL TO TAKE HER HUSBAND INTO
HER CONFIDENCE BOTH POINTED IN THAT DIRECTION I THEREFORE CABLED TO
MY FRIEND WILSON HARGREAVE OF THE NEW YORK POLICE BUREAU WHO HAS
MORE THAN ONCE MADE USE OF MY KNOWLEDGE OF LONDON CRIME I ASKED HIM
WHETHER THE NAME OF ABE SLANEY WAS KNOWN TO HIM HERE IS HIS REPLY
THE MOST DANGEROUS CROOK IN CHICAGO ON THE VERY EVENING UPON WHICH
I HAD HIS ANSWER HILTON CUBITT SENT ME THE LAST MESSAGE FROM SLANEY
WORKING WITH KNOWN LETTERS IT TOOK THIS FORM
ELSIE REARE TO MEET THY GO
THE ADDITION OF A P AND A D COMPLETED A MESSAGE WHICH SHOWED ME THAT
THE RASCAL WAS PROCEEDING FROM PERSUASION TO THREATS AND MY
KNOWLEDGE OF THE CROOKS OF CHICAGO PREPARED ME TO FIND THAT HE MIGHT
VERY RAPIDLY PUT HIS WORDS INTO ACTION I AT ONCE CAME TO NORFOLK
WITH MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE DR WATSON BUT UNHAPPILY ONLY IN
TIME TO FIND THAT THE WORST HAD ALREADY OCCURRED
IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH YOU IN THE HANDLING OF A
CASE SAID THE INSPECTOR WARMLY YOU WILL EXCUSE ME HOWEVER IF I
SPEAK FRANKLY TO YOU YOU ARE ONLY ANSWERABLE TO YOURSELF BUT I HAVE
TO ANSWER TO MY SUPERIORS IF THIS ABE SLANEY LIVING AT ELRIGES IS
INDEED THE MURDERER AND IF HE HAS MADE HIS ESCAPE WHILE I AM SEATED
HERE I SHOULD CERTAINLY GET INTO SERIOUS TROUBLE
YOU NEED NOT BE UNEASY HE WILL NOT TRY TO ESCAPE
HOW DO YOU KNOW
TO FLY WOULD BE A CONFESSION OF GUILT
THEN LET US GO TO ARREST HIM
I EXPECT HIM HERE EVERY INSTANT
BUT WHY SHOULD HE COME
BECAUSE I HAVE WRITTEN AND ASKED HIM
BUT THIS IS INCREDIBLE MR HOLMES WHY SHOULD HE COME BECAUSE YOU
HAVE ASKED HIM WOULD NOT SUCH A REQUEST RATHER ROUSE HIS SUSPICIONS
AND CAUSE HIM TO FLY
I THINK I HAVE KNOWN HOW TO FRAME THE LETTER SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
IN FACT IF I AM NOT VERY MUCH MISTAKEN HERE IS THE GENTLEMAN
HIMSELF COMING UP THE DRIVE
A MAN WAS STRIDING UP THE PATH WHICH LED TO THE DOOR HE WAS A TALL
HANDSOME SWARTHY FELLOW CLAD IN A SUIT OF GREY FLANNEL WITH A
PANAMA HAT A BRISTLING BLACK BEARD AND A GREAT AGGRESSIVE HOOKED
NOSE AND FLOURISHING A CANE AS HE WALKED HE SWAGGERED UP THE PATH
AS IF THE PLACE BELONGED TO HIM AND WE HEARD HIS LOUD CONFIDENT
PEAL AT THE BELL
I THINK GENTLEMEN SAID HOLMES QUIETLY THAT WE HAD BEST TAKE UP
OUR POSITION BEHIND THE DOOR EVERY PRECAUTION IS NECESSARY WHEN
DEALING WITH SUCH A FELLOW YOU WILL NEED YOUR HANDCUFFS INSPECTOR
YOU CAN LEAVE THE TALKING TO ME
WE WAITED IN SILENCE FOR A MINUTEONE OF THOSE MINUTES WHICH ONE CAN
NEVER FORGET THEN THE DOOR OPENED AND THE MAN STEPPED IN IN AN
INSTANT HOLMES CLAPPED A PISTOL TO HIS HEAD AND MARTIN SLIPPED THE
HANDCUFFS OVER HIS WRISTS IT WAS ALL DONE SO SWIFTLY AND DEFTLY THAT
THE FELLOW WAS HELPLESS BEFORE HE KNEW THAT HE WAS ATTACKED HE
GLARED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US WITH A PAIR OF BLAZING BLACK EYES
THEN HE BURST INTO A BITTER LAUGH
WELL GENTLEMEN YOU HAVE THE DROP ON ME THIS TIME I SEEM TO HAVE
KNOCKED UP AGAINST SOMETHING HARD BUT I CAME HERE IN ANSWER TO A
LETTER FROM MRS HILTON CUBITT DONT TELL ME THAT SHE IS IN THIS
DONT TELL ME THAT SHE HELPED TO SET A TRAP FOR ME
MRS HILTON CUBITT WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED AND IS AT DEATHS DOOR
THE MAN GAVE A HOARSE CRY OF GRIEF WHICH RANG THROUGH THE HOUSE
YOURE CRAZY HE CRIED FIERCELY IT WAS HE THAT WAS HURT NOT
SHE WHO WOULD HAVE HURT LITTLE ELSIE I MAY HAVE THREATENED HER GOD
FORGIVE ME BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE TOUCHED A HAIR OF HER PRETTY HEAD
TAKE IT BACKYOU SAY THAT SHE IS NOT HURT
SHE WAS FOUND BADLY WOUNDED BY THE SIDE OF HER DEAD HUSBAND
HE SANK WITH A DEEP GROAN ON TO THE SETTEE AND BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS
MANACLED HANDS FOR FIVE MINUTES HE WAS SILENT THEN HE RAISED HIS
FACE ONCE MORE AND SPOKE WITH THE COLD COMPOSURE OF DESPAIR
I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE FROM YOU GENTLEMEN SAID HE IF I SHOT THE
MAN HE HAD HIS SHOT AT ME AND THERES NO MURDER IN THAT BUT IF YOU
THINK I COULD HAVE HURT THAT WOMAN THEN YOU DONT KNOW EITHER ME OR
HER I TELL YOU THERE WAS NEVER A MAN IN THIS WORLD LOVED A WOMAN
MORE THAN I LOVED HER I HAD A RIGHT TO HER SHE WAS PLEDGED TO ME
YEARS AGO WHO WAS THIS ENGLISHMAN THAT HE SHOULD COME BETWEEN US I
TELL YOU THAT I HAD THE FIRST RIGHT TO HER AND THAT I WAS ONLY
CLAIMING MY OWN
SHE BROKE AWAY FROM YOUR INFLUENCE WHEN SHE FOUND THE MAN THAT YOU
ARE SAID HOLMES STERNLY SHE FLED FROM AMERICA TO AVOID YOU AND
SHE MARRIED AN HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN IN ENGLAND YOU DOGGED HER AND
FOLLOWED HER AND MADE HER LIFE A MISERY TO HER IN ORDER TO INDUCE HER
TO ABANDON THE HUSBAND WHOM SHE LOVED AND RESPECTED IN ORDER TO FLY
WITH YOU WHOM SHE FEARED AND HATED YOU HAVE ENDED BY BRINGING ABOUT
THE DEATH OF A NOBLE MAN AND DRIVING HIS WIFE TO SUICIDE THAT IS
YOUR RECORD IN THIS BUSINESS MR ABE SLANEY AND YOU WILL ANSWER FOR
IT TO THE LAW
IF ELSIE DIES I CARE NOTHING WHAT BECOMES OF ME SAID THE AMERICAN
HE OPENED ONE OF HIS HANDS AND LOOKED AT A NOTE CRUMPLED UP IN HIS
PALM SEE HERE MISTER HE CRIED WITH A GLEAM OF SUSPICION IN HIS
EYES YOURE NOT TRYING TO SCARE ME OVER THIS ARE YOU IF THE LADY
IS HURT AS BAD AS YOU SAY WHO WAS IT THAT WROTE THIS NOTE HE
TOSSED IT FORWARDS ON TO THE TABLE
I WROTE IT TO BRING YOU HERE
YOU WROTE IT THERE WAS NO ONE ON EARTH OUTSIDE THE JOINT WHO KNEW
THE SECRET OF THE DANCING MEN HOW CAME YOU TO WRITE IT
WHAT ONE MAN CAN INVENT ANOTHER CAN DISCOVER SAID HOLMES THERE
IS A CAB COMING TO CONVEY YOU TO NORWICH MR SLANEY BUT MEANWHILE
YOU HAVE TIME TO MAKE SOME SMALL REPARATION FOR THE INJURY YOU HAVE
WROUGHT ARE YOU AWARE THAT MRS HILTON CUBITT HAS HERSELF LAIN UNDER
GRAVE SUSPICION OF THE MURDER OF HER HUSBAND AND THAT IT WAS ONLY MY
PRESENCE HERE AND THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH I HAPPENED TO POSSESS WHICH HAS
SAVED HER FROM THE ACCUSATION THE LEAST THAT YOU OWE HER IS TO MAKE
IT CLEAR TO THE WHOLE WORLD THAT SHE WAS IN NO WAY DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS TRAGIC END
I ASK NOTHING BETTER SAID THE AMERICAN I GUESS THE VERY BEST
CASE I CAN MAKE FOR MYSELF IS THE ABSOLUTE NAKED TRUTH
IT IS MY DUTY TO WARN YOU THAT IT WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU CRIED
THE INSPECTOR WITH THE MAGNIFICENT FAIRPLAY OF THE BRITISH CRIMINAL
LAW
SLANEY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
ILL CHANCE THAT SAID HE FIRST OF ALL I WANT YOU GENTLEMEN TO
UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE KNOWN THIS LADY SINCE SHE WAS A CHILD THERE
WERE SEVEN OF US IN A GANG IN CHICAGO AND ELSIES FATHER WAS THE
BOSS OF THE JOINT HE WAS A CLEVER MAN WAS OLD PATRICK IT WAS HE
WHO INVENTED THAT WRITING WHICH WOULD PASS AS A CHILDS SCRAWL
UNLESS YOU JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE THE KEY TO IT WELL ELSIE LEARNED
SOME OF OUR WAYS BUT SHE COULDNT STAND THE BUSINESS AND SHE HAD A
BIT OF HONEST MONEY OF HER OWN SO SHE GAVE US ALL THE SLIP AND GOT
AWAY TO LONDON SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED TO ME AND SHE WOULD HAVE
MARRIED ME I BELIEVE IF I HAD TAKEN OVER ANOTHER PROFESSION BUT
SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING ON THE CROSS IT WAS ONLY
AFTER HER MARRIAGE TO THIS ENGLISHMAN THAT I WAS ABLE TO FIND OUT
WHERE SHE WAS I WROTE TO HER BUT GOT NO ANSWER AFTER THAT I CAME
OVER AND AS LETTERS WERE NO USE I PUT MY MESSAGES WHERE SHE COULD
READ THEM
WELL I HAVE BEEN HERE A MONTH NOW I LIVED IN THAT FARM WHERE I
HAD A ROOM DOWN BELOW AND COULD GET IN AND OUT EVERY NIGHT AND NO
ONE THE WISER I TRIED ALL I COULD TO COAX ELSIE AWAY I KNEW THAT
SHE READ THE MESSAGES FOR ONCE SHE WROTE AN ANSWER UNDER ONE OF
THEM THEN MY TEMPER GOT THE BETTER OF ME AND I BEGAN TO THREATEN
HER SHE SENT ME A LETTER THEN IMPLORING ME TO GO AWAY AND SAYING
THAT IT WOULD BREAK HER HEART IF ANY SCANDAL SHOULD COME UPON HER
HUSBAND SHE SAID THAT SHE WOULD COME DOWN WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS
ASLEEP AT THREE IN THE MORNING AND SPEAK WITH ME THROUGH THE END
WINDOW IF I WOULD GO AWAY AFTERWARDS AND LEAVE HER IN PEACE SHE
CAME DOWN AND BROUGHT MONEY WITH HER TRYING TO BRIBE ME TO GO THIS
MADE ME MAD AND I CAUGHT HER ARM AND TRIED TO PULL HER THROUGH THE
WINDOW AT THAT MOMENT IN RUSHED THE HUSBAND WITH HIS REVOLVER IN HIS
HAND ELSIE HAD SUNK DOWN UPON THE FLOOR AND WE WERE FACE TO FACE I
WAS HEELED ALSO AND I HELD UP MY GUN TO SCARE HIM OFF AND LET ME GET
AWAY HE FIRED AND MISSED ME I PULLED OFF ALMOST AT THE SAME
INSTANT AND DOWN HE DROPPED I MADE AWAY ACROSS THE GARDEN AND AS I
WENT I HEARD THE WINDOW SHUT BEHIND ME THATS GODS TRUTH
GENTLEMEN EVERY WORD OF IT AND I HEARD NO MORE ABOUT IT UNTIL THAT
LAD CAME RIDING UP WITH A NOTE WHICH MADE ME WALK IN HERE LIKE A
JAY AND GIVE MYSELF INTO YOUR HANDS
A CAB HAD DRIVEN UP WHILST THE AMERICAN HAD BEEN TALKING TWO
UNIFORMED POLICEMEN SAT INSIDE INSPECTOR MARTIN ROSE AND TOUCHED HIS
PRISONER ON THE SHOULDER
IT IS TIME FOR US TO GO
CAN I SEE HER FIRST
NO SHE IS NOT CONSCIOUS MR SHERLOCK HOLMES I ONLY HOPE THAT IF
EVER AGAIN I HAVE AN IMPORTANT CASE I SHALL HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE TO
HAVE YOU BY MY SIDE
WE STOOD AT THE WINDOW AND WATCHED THE CAB DRIVE AWAY AS I TURNED
BACK MY EYE CAUGHT THE PELLET OF PAPER WHICH THE PRISONER HAD TOSSED
UPON THE TABLE IT WAS THE NOTE WITH WHICH HOLMES HAD DECOYED HIM
SEE IF YOU CAN READ IT WATSON SAID HE WITH A SMILE
IT CONTAINED NO WORD BUT THIS LITTLE LINE OF DANCING MEN
PICTURE PICTURE OF VARIOUS DANCING MEN IF YOU USE THE CODE WHICH I
HAVE EXPLAINED SAID HOLMES YOU WILL
FIND THAT IT SIMPLY MEANS COME HERE AT ONCE I WAS CONVINCED THAT
IT WAS AN INVITATION WHICH HE WOULD NOT REFUSE SINCE HE COULD NEVER
IMAGINE THAT IT COULD COME FROM ANYONE BUT THE LADY AND SO MY DEAR
WATSON WE HAVE ENDED BY TURNING THE DANCING MEN TO GOOD WHEN THEY
HAVE SO OFTEN BEEN THE AGENTS OF EVIL AND I THINK THAT I HAVE
FULFILLED MY PROMISE OF GIVING YOU SOMETHING UNUSUAL FOR YOUR
NOTEBOOK THREEFORTY IS OUR TRAIN AND I FANCY WE SHOULD BE BACK IN
BAKER STREET FOR DINNER
ONLY ONE WORD OF EPILOGUE THE AMERICAN ABE SLANEY WAS CONDEMNED TO
DEATH AT THE WINTER ASSIZES AT NORWICH BUT HIS PENALTY WAS CHANGED
TO PENAL SERVITUDE IN CONSIDERATION OF MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES AND
THE CERTAINTY THAT HILTON CUBITT HAD FIRED THE FIRST SHOT OF MRS
HILTON CUBITT I ONLY KNOW THAT I HAVE HEARD SHE RECOVERED ENTIRELY
AND THAT SHE STILL REMAINS A WIDOW DEVOTING HER WHOLE LIFE TO THE
CARE OF THE POOR AND TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER HUSBANDS ESTATE
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST
FROM THE YEARS TO INCLUSIVE MR SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS A VERY
BUSY MAN IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE WAS NO PUBLIC CASE OF ANY
DIFFICULTY IN WHICH HE WAS NOT CONSULTED DURING THOSE EIGHT YEARS
AND THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF PRIVATE CASES SOME OF THEM OF THE MOST
INTRICATE AND EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER IN WHICH HE PLAYED A PROMINENT
PART MANY STARTLING SUCCESSES AND A FEW UNAVOIDABLE FAILURES WERE
THE OUTCOME OF THIS LONG PERIOD OF CONTINUOUS WORK AS I HAVE
PRESERVED VERY FULL NOTES OF ALL THESE CASES AND WAS MYSELF
PERSONALLY ENGAGED IN MANY OF THEM IT MAY BE IMAGINED THAT IT IS NO
EASY TASK TO KNOW WHICH I SHOULD SELECT TO LAY BEFORE THE PUBLIC I
SHALL HOWEVER PRESERVE MY FORMER RULE AND GIVE THE PREFERENCE TO
THOSE CASES WHICH DERIVE THEIR INTEREST NOT SO MUCH FROM THE
BRUTALITY OF THE CRIME AS FROM THE INGENUITY AND DRAMATIC QUALITY OF
THE SOLUTION FOR THIS REASON I WILL NOW LAY BEFORE THE READER THE
FACTS CONNECTED WITH MISS VIOLET SMITH THE SOLITARY CYCLIST OF
CHARLINGTON AND THE CURIOUS SEQUEL OF OUR INVESTIGATION WHICH
CULMINATED IN UNEXPECTED TRAGEDY IT IS TRUE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES
DID NOT ADMIT OF ANY STRIKING ILLUSTRATION OF THOSE POWERS FOR WHICH
MY FRIEND WAS FAMOUS BUT THERE WERE SOME POINTS ABOUT THE CASE WHICH
MADE IT STAND OUT IN THOSE LONG RECORDS OF CRIME FROM WHICH I GATHER
THE MATERIAL FOR THESE LITTLE NARRATIVES
ON REFERRING TO MY NOTEBOOK FOR THE YEAR I FIND THAT IT WAS
UPON SATURDAY THE RD OF APRIL THAT WE FIRST HEARD OF MISS VIOLET
SMITH HER VISIT WAS I REMEMBER EXTREMELY UNWELCOME TO HOLMES FOR
HE WAS IMMERSED AT THE MOMENT IN A VERY ABSTRUSE AND COMPLICATED
PROBLEM CONCERNING THE PECULIAR PERSECUTION TO WHICH JOHN VINCENT
HARDEN THE WELLKNOWN TOBACCO MILLIONAIRE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED MY
FRIEND WHO LOVED ABOVE ALL THINGS PRECISION AND CONCENTRATION OF
THOUGHT RESENTED ANYTHING WHICH DISTRACTED HIS ATTENTION FROM THE
MATTER IN HAND AND YET WITHOUT A HARSHNESS WHICH WAS FOREIGN TO HIS
NATURE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REFUSE TO LISTEN TO THE STORY OF THE
YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN TALL GRACEFUL AND QUEENLY WHO PRESENTED
HERSELF AT BAKER STREET LATE IN THE EVENING AND IMPLORED HIS
ASSISTANCE AND ADVICE IT WAS VAIN TO URGE THAT HIS TIME WAS ALREADY
FULLY OCCUPIED FOR THE YOUNG LADY HAD COME WITH THE DETERMINATION TO
TELL HER STORY AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT NOTHING SHORT OF FORCE COULD
GET HER OUT OF THE ROOM UNTIL SHE HAD DONE SO WITH A RESIGNED AIR
AND A SOMEWHAT WEARY SMILE HOLMES BEGGED THE BEAUTIFUL INTRUDER TO
TAKE A SEAT AND TO INFORM US WHAT IT WAS THAT WAS TROUBLING HER
AT LEAST IT CANNOT BE YOUR HEALTH SAID HE AS HIS KEEN EYES DARTED
OVER HER SO ARDENT A BICYCLIST MUST BE FULL OF ENERGY
SHE GLANCED DOWN IN SURPRISE AT HER OWN FEET AND I OBSERVED THE
SLIGHT ROUGHENING OF THE SIDE OF THE SOLE CAUSED BY THE FRICTION OF
THE EDGE OF THE PEDAL
YES I BICYCLE A GOOD DEAL MR HOLMES AND THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH MY VISIT TO YOU TODAY
MY FRIEND TOOK THE LADYS UNGLOVED HAND AND EXAMINED IT WITH AS CLOSE
AN ATTENTION AND AS LITTLE SENTIMENT AS A SCIENTIST WOULD SHOW TO A
SPECIMEN
YOU WILL EXCUSE ME I AM SURE IT IS MY BUSINESS SAID HE AS HE
DROPPED IT I NEARLY FELL INTO THE ERROR OF SUPPOSING THAT YOU WERE
TYPEWRITING OF COURSE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IT IS MUSIC YOU OBSERVE
THE SPATULATE FINGEREND WATSON WHICH IS COMMON TO BOTH
PROFESSIONS THERE IS A SPIRITUALITY ABOUT THE FACE HOWEVERHE
GENTLY TURNED IT TOWARDS THE LIGHTWHICH THE TYPEWRITER DOES NOT
GENERATE THIS LADY IS A MUSICIAN
YES MR HOLMES I TEACH MUSIC
IN THE COUNTRY I PRESUME FROM YOUR COMPLEXION
YES SIR NEAR FARNHAM ON THE BORDERS OF SURREY
A BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBOURHOOD AND FULL OF THE MOST INTERESTING
ASSOCIATIONS YOU REMEMBER WATSON THAT IT WAS NEAR THERE THAT WE
TOOK ARCHIE STAMFORD THE FORGER NOW MISS VIOLET WHAT HAS HAPPENED
TO YOU NEAR FARNHAM ON THE BORDERS OF SURREY
THE YOUNG LADY WITH GREAT CLEARNESS AND COMPOSURE MADE THE
FOLLOWING CURIOUS STATEMENT
MY FATHER IS DEAD MR HOLMES HE WAS JAMES SMITH WHO CONDUCTED THE
ORCHESTRA AT THE OLD IMPERIAL THEATRE MY MOTHER AND I WERE LEFT
WITHOUT A RELATION IN THE WORLD EXCEPT ONE UNCLE RALPH SMITH WHO
WENT TO AFRICA TWENTYFIVE YEARS AGO AND WE HAVE NEVER HAD A WORD
FROM HIM SINCE WHEN FATHER DIED WE WERE LEFT VERY POOR BUT ONE DAY
WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WAS AN ADVERTISEMENT IN THE TIMES INQUIRING
FOR OUR WHEREABOUTS YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW EXCITED WE WERE FOR WE
THOUGHT THAT SOMEONE HAD LEFT US A FORTUNE WE WENT AT ONCE TO THE
LAWYER WHOSE NAME WAS GIVEN IN THE PAPER THERE WE MET TWO GENTLEMEN
MR CARRUTHERS AND MR WOODLEY WHO WERE HOME ON A VISIT FROM SOUTH
AFRICA THEY SAID THAT MY UNCLE WAS A FRIEND OF THEIRS THAT HE DIED
SOME MONTHS BEFORE IN GREAT POVERTY IN JOHANNESBURG AND THAT HE HAD
ASKED THEM WITH HIS LAST BREATH TO HUNT UP HIS RELATIONS AND SEE THAT
THEY WERE IN NO WANT IT SEEMED STRANGE TO US THAT UNCLE RALPH WHO
TOOK NO NOTICE OF US WHEN HE WAS ALIVE SHOULD BE SO CAREFUL TO LOOK
AFTER US WHEN HE WAS DEAD BUT MR CARRUTHERS EXPLAINED THAT THE
REASON WAS THAT MY UNCLE HAD JUST HEARD OF THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER
AND SO FELT RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR FATE
EXCUSE ME SAID HOLMES WHEN WAS THIS INTERVIEW
LAST DECEMBERFOUR MONTHS AGO
PRAY PROCEED
MR WOODLEY SEEMED TO ME TO BE A MOST ODIOUS PERSON HE WAS FOR EVER
MAKING EYES AT MEA COARSE PUFFYFACED REDMOUSTACHED YOUNG MAN
WITH HIS HAIR PLASTERED DOWN ON EACH SIDE OF HIS FOREHEAD I THOUGHT
THAT HE WAS PERFECTLY HATEFULAND I WAS SURE THAT CYRIL WOULD NOT
WISH ME TO KNOW SUCH A PERSON
OH CYRIL IS HIS NAME SAID HOLMES SMILING
THE YOUNG LADY BLUSHED AND LAUGHED
YES MR HOLMES CYRIL MORTON AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER AND WE HOPE
TO BE MARRIED AT THE END OF THE SUMMER DEAR ME HOW DID I GET
TALKING ABOUT HIM WHAT I WISHED TO SAY WAS THAT MR WOODLEY WAS
PERFECTLY ODIOUS BUT THAT MR CARRUTHERS WHO WAS A MUCH OLDER MAN
WAS MORE AGREEABLE HE WAS A DARK SALLOW CLEANSHAVEN SILENT
PERSON BUT HE HAD POLITE MANNERS AND A PLEASANT SMILE HE INQUIRED
HOW WE WERE LEFT AND ON FINDING THAT WE WERE VERY POOR HE SUGGESTED
THAT I SHOULD COME AND TEACH MUSIC TO HIS ONLY DAUGHTER AGED TEN I
SAID THAT I DID NOT LIKE TO LEAVE MY MOTHER ON WHICH HE SUGGESTED
THAT I SHOULD GO HOME TO HER EVERY WEEKEND AND HE OFFERED ME A
HUNDRED A YEAR WHICH WAS CERTAINLY SPLENDID PAY SO IT ENDED BY MY
ACCEPTING AND I WENT DOWN TO CHILTERN GRANGE ABOUT SIX MILES FROM
FARNHAM MR CARRUTHERS WAS A WIDOWER BUT HE HAD ENGAGED A
LADYHOUSEKEEPER A VERY RESPECTABLE ELDERLY PERSON CALLED MRS
DIXON TO LOOK AFTER HIS ESTABLISHMENT THE CHILD WAS A DEAR AND
EVERYTHING PROMISED WELL MR CARRUTHERS WAS VERY KIND AND VERY
MUSICAL AND WE HAD MOST PLEASANT EVENINGS TOGETHER EVERY WEEKEND I
WENT HOME TO MY MOTHER IN TOWN
THE FIRST FLAW IN MY HAPPINESS WAS THE ARRIVAL OF THE REDMOUSTACHED
MR WOODLEY HE CAME FOR A VISIT OF A WEEK AND OH IT SEEMED THREE
MONTHS TO ME HE WAS A DREADFUL PERSON A BULLY TO EVERYONE ELSE BUT
TO ME SOMETHING INFINITELY WORSE HE MADE ODIOUS LOVE TO ME BOASTED
OF HIS WEALTH SAID THAT IF I MARRIED HIM I WOULD HAVE THE FINEST
DIAMONDS IN LONDON AND FINALLY WHEN I WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
HIM HE SEIZED ME IN HIS ARMS ONE DAY AFTER DINNERHE WAS HIDEOUSLY
STRONGAND HE SWORE THAT HE WOULD NOT LET ME GO UNTIL I HAD KISSED
HIM MR CARRUTHERS CAME IN AND TORE HIM OFF FROM ME ON WHICH HE
TURNED UPON HIS OWN HOST KNOCKING HIM DOWN AND CUTTING HIS FACE
OPEN THAT WAS THE END OF HIS VISIT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE MR
CARRUTHERS APOLOGIZED TO ME NEXT DAY AND ASSURED ME THAT I SHOULD
NEVER BE EXPOSED TO SUCH AN INSULT AGAIN I HAVE NOT SEEN MR WOODLEY
SINCE
AND NOW MR HOLMES I COME AT LAST TO THE SPECIAL THING WHICH HAS
CAUSED ME TO ASK YOUR ADVICE TODAY YOU MUST KNOW THAT EVERY
SATURDAY FORENOON I RIDE ON MY BICYCLE TO FARNHAM STATION IN ORDER TO
GET THE TO TOWN THE ROAD FROM CHILTERN GRANGE IS A LONELY ONE
AND AT ONE SPOT IT IS PARTICULARLY SO FOR IT LIES FOR OVER A MILE
BETWEEN CHARLINGTON HEATH UPON ONE SIDE AND THE WOODS WHICH LIE ROUND
CHARLINGTON HALL UPON THE OTHER YOU COULD NOT FIND A MORE LONELY
TRACT OF ROAD ANYWHERE AND IT IS QUITE RARE TO MEET SO MUCH AS A
CART OR A PEASANT UNTIL YOU REACH THE HIGH ROAD NEAR CROOKSBURY
HILL TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS PASSING THIS PLACE WHEN I CHANCED TO LOOK
BACK OVER MY SHOULDER AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND ME I SAW A
MAN ALSO ON A BICYCLE HE SEEMED TO BE A MIDDLEAGED MAN WITH A
SHORT DARK BEARD I LOOKED BACK BEFORE I REACHED FARNHAM BUT THE
MAN WAS GONE SO I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT IT BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW
SURPRISED I WAS MR HOLMES WHEN ON MY RETURN ON THE MONDAY I SAW
THE SAME MAN ON THE SAME STRETCH OF ROAD MY ASTONISHMENT WAS
INCREASED WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED AGAIN EXACTLY AS BEFORE ON THE
FOLLOWING SATURDAY AND MONDAY HE ALWAYS KEPT HIS DISTANCE AND DID
NOT MOLEST ME IN ANY WAY BUT STILL IT CERTAINLY WAS VERY ODD I
MENTIONED IT TO MR CARRUTHERS WHO SEEMED INTERESTED IN WHAT I SAID
AND TOLD ME THAT HE HAD ORDERED A HORSE AND TRAP SO THAT IN FUTURE I
SHOULD NOT PASS OVER THESE LONELY ROADS WITHOUT SOME COMPANION
THE HORSE AND TRAP WERE TO HAVE COME THIS WEEK BUT FOR SOME REASON
THEY WERE NOT DELIVERED AND AGAIN I HAD TO CYCLE TO THE STATION
THAT WAS THIS MORNING YOU CAN THINK THAT I LOOKED OUT WHEN I CAME TO
CHARLINGTON HEATH AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS THE MAN EXACTLY AS HE
HAD BEEN THE TWO WEEKS BEFORE HE ALWAYS KEPT SO FAR FROM ME THAT I
COULD NOT CLEARLY SEE HIS FACE BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY SOMEONE WHOM I
DID NOT KNOW HE WAS DRESSED IN A DARK SUIT WITH A CLOTH CAP THE
ONLY THING ABOUT HIS FACE THAT I COULD CLEARLY SEE WAS HIS DARK
BEARD TODAY I WAS NOT ALARMED BUT I WAS FILLED WITH CURIOSITY AND
I DETERMINED TO FIND OUT WHO HE WAS AND WHAT HE WANTED I SLOWED DOWN
MY MACHINE BUT HE SLOWED DOWN HIS THEN I STOPPED ALTOGETHER BUT HE
STOPPED ALSO THEN I LAID A TRAP FOR HIM THERE IS A SHARP TURNING OF
THE ROAD AND I PEDALLED VERY QUICKLY ROUND THIS AND THEN I STOPPED
AND WAITED I EXPECTED HIM TO SHOOT ROUND AND PASS ME BEFORE HE COULD
STOP BUT HE NEVER APPEARED THEN I WENT BACK AND LOOKED ROUND THE
CORNER I COULD SEE A MILE OF ROAD BUT HE WAS NOT ON IT TO MAKE IT
THE MORE EXTRAORDINARY THERE WAS NO SIDE ROAD AT THIS POINT DOWN
WHICH HE COULD HAVE GONE
HOLMES CHUCKLED AND RUBBED HIS HANDS THIS CASE CERTAINLY PRESENTS
SOME FEATURES OF ITS OWN SAID HE HOW MUCH TIME ELAPSED BETWEEN
YOUR TURNING THE CORNER AND YOUR DISCOVERY THAT THE ROAD WAS CLEAR
TWO OR THREE MINUTES
THEN HE COULD NOT HAVE RETREATED DOWN THE ROAD AND YOU SAY THAT
THERE ARE NO SIDE ROADS
NONE
THEN HE CERTAINLY TOOK A FOOTPATH ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE SIDE OF THE HEATH OR I SHOULD HAVE
SEEN HIM
SO BY THE PROCESS OF EXCLUSION WE ARRIVE AT THE FACT THAT HE MADE
HIS WAY TOWARDS CHARLINGTON HALL WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND IS SITUATED
IN ITS OWN GROUNDS ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD ANYTHING ELSE
NOTHING MR HOLMES SAVE THAT I WAS SO PERPLEXED THAT I FELT I
SHOULD NOT BE HAPPY UNTIL I HAD SEEN YOU AND HAD YOUR ADVICE
HOLMES SAT IN SILENCE FOR SOME LITTLE TIME
WHERE IS THE GENTLEMAN TO WHOM YOU ARE ENGAGED HE ASKED AT LAST
HE IS IN THE MIDLAND ELECTRICAL COMPANY AT COVENTRY
HE WOULD NOT PAY YOU A SURPRISE VISIT
OH MR HOLMES AS IF I SHOULD NOT KNOW HIM
HAVE YOU HAD ANY OTHER ADMIRERS
SEVERAL BEFORE I KNEW CYRIL
AND SINCE
THERE WAS THIS DREADFUL MAN WOODLEY IF YOU CAN CALL HIM AN
ADMIRER
NO ONE ELSE
OUR FAIR CLIENT SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED
WHO WAS HE ASKED HOLMES
OH IT MAY BE A MERE FANCY OF MINE BUT IT HAS SEEMED TO ME
SOMETIMES THAT MY EMPLOYER MR CARRUTHERS TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF
INTEREST IN ME WE ARE THROWN RATHER TOGETHER I PLAY HIS
ACCOMPANIMENTS IN THE EVENING HE HAS NEVER SAID ANYTHING HE IS A
PERFECT GENTLEMAN BUT A GIRL ALWAYS KNOWS
HA HOLMES LOOKED GRAVE WHAT DOES HE DO FOR A LIVING
HE IS A RICH MAN
NO CARRIAGES OR HORSES
WELL AT LEAST HE IS FAIRLY WELLTODO BUT HE GOES INTO THE CITY
TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK HE IS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN SOUTH AFRICAN
GOLD SHARES
YOU WILL LET ME KNOW ANY FRESH DEVELOPMENT MISS SMITH I AM VERY
BUSY JUST NOW BUT I WILL FIND TIME TO MAKE SOME INQUIRIES INTO YOUR
CASE IN THE MEANTIME TAKE NO STEP WITHOUT LETTING ME KNOW GOODBYE
AND I TRUST THAT WE SHALL HAVE NOTHING BUT GOOD NEWS FROM YOU
IT IS PART OF THE SETTLED ORDER OF NATURE THAT SUCH A GIRL SHOULD
HAVE FOLLOWERS SAID HOLMES AS HE PULLED AT HIS MEDITATIVE PIPE
BUT FOR CHOICE NOT ON BICYCLES IN LONELY COUNTRY ROADS SOME
SECRETIVE LOVER BEYOND ALL DOUBT BUT THERE ARE CURIOUS AND
SUGGESTIVE DETAILS ABOUT THE CASE WATSON
THAT HE SHOULD APPEAR ONLY AT THAT POINT
EXACTLY OUR FIRST EFFORT MUST BE TO FIND WHO ARE THE TENANTS OF
CHARLINGTON HALL THEN AGAIN HOW ABOUT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN
CARRUTHERS AND WOODLEY SINCE THEY APPEAR TO BE MEN OF SUCH A
DIFFERENT TYPE HOW CAME THEY BOTH TO BE SO KEEN UPON LOOKING UP
RALPH SMITHS RELATIONS ONE MORE POINT WHAT SORT OF A MENAGE IS IT
WHICH PAYS DOUBLE THE MARKET PRICE FOR A GOVERNESS BUT DOES NOT KEEP
A HORSE ALTHOUGH SIX MILES FROM THE STATION ODD WATSONVERY ODD
YOU WILL GO DOWN
NO MY DEAR FELLOW YOU WILL GO DOWN THIS MAY BE SOME TRIFLING
INTRIGUE AND I CANNOT BREAK MY OTHER IMPORTANT RESEARCH FOR THE SAKE
OF IT ON MONDAY YOU WILL ARRIVE EARLY AT FARNHAM YOU WILL CONCEAL
YOURSELF NEAR CHARLINGTON HEATH YOU WILL OBSERVE THESE FACTS FOR
YOURSELF AND ACT AS YOUR OWN JUDGMENT ADVISES THEN HAVING INQUIRED
AS TO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE HALL YOU WILL COME BACK TO ME AND REPORT
AND NOW WATSON NOT ANOTHER WORD OF THE MATTER UNTIL WE HAVE A FEW
SOLID STEPPINGSTONES ON WHICH WE MAY HOPE TO GET ACROSS TO OUR
SOLUTION
WE HAD ASCERTAINED FROM THE LADY THAT SHE WENT DOWN UPON THE MONDAY
BY THE TRAIN WHICH LEAVES WATERLOO AT SO I STARTED EARLY AND
CAUGHT THE AT FARNHAM STATION I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN BEING
DIRECTED TO CHARLINGTON HEATH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MISTAKE THE SCENE
OF THE YOUNG LADYS ADVENTURE FOR THE ROAD RUNS BETWEEN THE OPEN
HEATH ON ONE SIDE AND AN OLD YEW HEDGE UPON THE OTHER SURROUNDING A
PARK WHICH IS STUDDED WITH MAGNIFICENT TREES THERE WAS A MAIN
GATEWAY OF LICHENSTUDDED STONE EACH SIDE PILLAR SURMOUNTED BY
MOULDERING HERALDIC EMBLEMS BUT BESIDES THIS CENTRAL CARRIAGE DRIVE
I OBSERVED SEVERAL POINTS WHERE THERE WERE GAPS IN THE HEDGE AND
PATHS LEADING THROUGH THEM THE HOUSE WAS INVISIBLE FROM THE ROAD
BUT THE SURROUNDINGS ALL SPOKE OF GLOOM AND DECAY
THE HEATH WAS COVERED WITH GOLDEN PATCHES OF FLOWERING GORSE
GLEAMING MAGNIFICENTLY IN THE LIGHT OF THE BRIGHT SPRING SUNSHINE
BEHIND ONE OF THESE CLUMPS I TOOK UP MY POSITION SO AS TO COMMAND
BOTH THE GATEWAY OF THE HALL AND A LONG STRETCH OF THE ROAD UPON
EITHER SIDE IT HAD BEEN DESERTED WHEN I LEFT IT BUT NOW I SAW A
CYCLIST RIDING DOWN IT FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THAT IN WHICH I
HAD COME HE WAS CLAD IN A DARK SUIT AND I SAW THAT HE HAD A BLACK
BEARD ON REACHING THE END OF THE CHARLINGTON GROUNDS HE SPRANG FROM
HIS MACHINE AND LED IT THROUGH A GAP IN THE HEDGE DISAPPEARING FROM
MY VIEW
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR PASSED AND THEN A SECOND CYCLIST APPEARED THIS
TIME IT WAS THE YOUNG LADY COMING FROM THE STATION I SAW HER LOOK
ABOUT HER AS SHE CAME TO THE CHARLINGTON HEDGE AN INSTANT LATER THE
MAN EMERGED FROM HIS HIDINGPLACE SPRANG UPON HIS CYCLE AND
FOLLOWED HER IN ALL THE BROAD LANDSCAPE THOSE WERE THE ONLY MOVING
FIGURES THE GRACEFUL GIRL SITTING VERY STRAIGHT UPON HER MACHINE
AND THE MAN BEHIND HER BENDING LOW OVER HIS HANDLEBAR WITH A
CURIOUSLY FURTIVE SUGGESTION IN EVERY MOVEMENT SHE LOOKED BACK AT
HIM AND SLOWED HER PACE HE SLOWED ALSO SHE STOPPED HE AT ONCE
STOPPED TOO KEEPING TWO HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND HER HER NEXT MOVEMENT
WAS AS UNEXPECTED AS IT WAS SPIRITED SHE SUDDENLY WHISKED HER WHEELS
ROUND AND DASHED STRAIGHT AT HIM HE WAS AS QUICK AS SHE HOWEVER
AND DARTED OFF IN DESPERATE FLIGHT PRESENTLY SHE CAME BACK UP THE
ROAD AGAIN HER HEAD HAUGHTILY IN THE AIR NOT DEIGNING TO TAKE ANY
FURTHER NOTICE OF HER SILENT ATTENDANT HE HAD TURNED ALSO AND STILL
KEPT HIS DISTANCE UNTIL THE CURVE OF THE ROAD HID THEM FROM MY SIGHT
I REMAINED IN MY HIDINGPLACE AND IT WAS WELL THAT I DID SO FOR
PRESENTLY THE MAN REAPPEARED CYCLING SLOWLY BACK HE TURNED IN AT THE
HALL GATES AND DISMOUNTED FROM HIS MACHINE FOR SOME FEW MINUTES I
COULD SEE HIM STANDING AMONG THE TREES HIS HANDS WERE RAISED AND HE
SEEMED TO BE SETTLING HIS NECKTIE THEN HE MOUNTED HIS CYCLE AND RODE
AWAY FROM ME DOWN THE DRIVE TOWARDS THE HALL I RAN ACROSS THE HEATH
AND PEERED THROUGH THE TREES FAR AWAY I COULD CATCH GLIMPSES OF THE
OLD GREY BUILDING WITH ITS BRISTLING TUDOR CHIMNEYS BUT THE DRIVE
RAN THROUGH A DENSE SHRUBBERY AND I SAW NO MORE OF MY MAN
HOWEVER IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD DONE A FAIRLY GOOD MORNINGS
WORK AND I WALKED BACK IN HIGH SPIRITS TO FARNHAM THE LOCAL
HOUSEAGENT COULD TELL ME NOTHING ABOUT CHARLINGTON HALL AND
REFERRED ME TO A WELLKNOWN FIRM IN PALL MALL THERE I HALTED ON MY
WAY HOME AND MET WITH COURTESY FROM THE REPRESENTATIVE NO I COULD
NOT HAVE CHARLINGTON HALL FOR THE SUMMER I WAS JUST TOO LATE IT HAD
BEEN LET ABOUT A MONTH AGO MR WILLIAMSON WAS THE NAME OF THE
TENANT HE WAS A RESPECTABLE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN THE POLITE AGENT WAS
AFRAID HE COULD SAY NO MORE AS THE AFFAIRS OF HIS CLIENTS WERE NOT
MATTERS WHICH HE COULD DISCUSS
MR SHERLOCK HOLMES LISTENED WITH ATTENTION TO THE LONG REPORT WHICH
I WAS ABLE TO PRESENT TO HIM THAT EVENING BUT IT DID NOT ELICIT THAT
WORD OF CURT PRAISE WHICH I HAD HOPED FOR AND SHOULD HAVE VALUED ON
THE CONTRARY HIS AUSTERE FACE WAS EVEN MORE SEVERE THAN USUAL AS HE
COMMENTED UPON THE THINGS THAT I HAD DONE AND THE THINGS THAT I HAD
NOT
YOUR HIDINGPLACE MY DEAR WATSON WAS VERY FAULTY YOU SHOULD HAVE
BEEN BEHIND THE HEDGE THEN YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A CLOSE VIEW OF THIS
INTERESTING PERSON AS IT IS YOU WERE SOME HUNDREDS OF YARDS AWAY
AND CAN TELL ME EVEN LESS THAN MISS SMITH SHE THINKS SHE DOES NOT
KNOW THE MAN I AM CONVINCED SHE DOES WHY OTHERWISE SHOULD HE BE
SO DESPERATELY ANXIOUS THAT SHE SHOULD NOT GET SO NEAR HIM AS TO SEE
HIS FEATURES YOU DESCRIBE HIM AS BENDING OVER THE HANDLEBAR
CONCEALMENT AGAIN YOU SEE YOU REALLY HAVE DONE REMARKABLY BADLY HE
RETURNS TO THE HOUSE AND YOU WANT TO FIND OUT WHO HE IS YOU COME TO
A LONDON HOUSEAGENT
WHAT SHOULD I HAVE DONE I CRIED WITH SOME HEAT
GONE TO THE NEAREST PUBLICHOUSE THAT IS THE CENTRE OF COUNTRY
GOSSIP THEY WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU EVERY NAME FROM THE MASTER TO THE
SCULLERYMAID WILLIAMSON IT CONVEYS NOTHING TO MY MIND IF HE IS AN
ELDERLY MAN HE IS NOT THIS ACTIVE CYCLIST WHO SPRINTS AWAY FROM THAT
ATHLETIC YOUNG LADYS PURSUIT WHAT HAVE WE GAINED BY YOUR
EXPEDITION THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE GIRLS STORY IS TRUE I NEVER
DOUBTED IT THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CYCLIST AND THE
HALL I NEVER DOUBTED THAT EITHER THAT THE HALL IS TENANTED BY
WILLIAMSON WHOS THE BETTER FOR THAT WELL WELL MY DEAR SIR DONT
LOOK SO DEPRESSED WE CAN DO LITTLE MORE UNTIL NEXT SATURDAY AND IN
THE MEANTIME I MAY MAKE ONE OR TWO INQUIRIES MYSELF
NEXT MORNING WE HAD A NOTE FROM MISS SMITH RECOUNTING SHORTLY AND
ACCURATELY THE VERY INCIDENTS WHICH I HAD SEEN BUT THE PITH OF THE
LETTER LAY IN THE POSTSCRIPT
I AM SURE THAT YOU WILL RESPECT MY CONFIDENCE MR HOLMES WHEN I
TELL YOU THAT MY PLACE HERE HAS BECOME DIFFICULT OWING TO THE FACT
THAT MY EMPLOYER HAS PROPOSED MARRIAGE TO ME I AM CONVINCED THAT HIS
FEELINGS ARE MOST DEEP AND MOST HONOURABLE AT THE SAME TIME MY
PROMISE IS OF COURSE GIVEN HE TOOK MY REFUSAL VERY SERIOUSLY BUT
ALSO VERY GENTLY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT THE SITUATION IS
A LITTLE STRAINED
OUR YOUNG FRIEND SEEMS TO BE GETTING INTO DEEP WATERS SAID HOLMES
THOUGHTFULLY AS HE FINISHED THE LETTER THE CASE CERTAINLY PRESENTS
MORE FEATURES OF INTEREST AND MORE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPMENT THAN I
HAD ORIGINALLY THOUGHT I SHOULD BE NONE THE WORSE FOR A QUIET
PEACEFUL DAY IN THE COUNTRY AND I AM INCLINED TO RUN DOWN THIS
AFTERNOON AND TEST ONE OR TWO THEORIES WHICH I HAVE FORMED
HOLMESS QUIET DAY IN THE COUNTRY HAD A SINGULAR TERMINATION FOR HE
ARRIVED AT BAKER STREET LATE IN THE EVENING WITH A CUT LIP AND A
DISCOLOURED LUMP UPON HIS FOREHEAD BESIDES A GENERAL AIR OF
DISSIPATION WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE HIS OWN PERSON THE FITTING OBJECT
OF A SCOTLAND YARD INVESTIGATION HE WAS IMMENSELY TICKLED BY HIS OWN
ADVENTURES AND LAUGHED HEARTILY AS HE RECOUNTED THEM
I GET SO LITTLE ACTIVE EXERCISE THAT IT IS ALWAYS A TREAT SAID HE
YOU ARE AWARE THAT I HAVE SOME PROFICIENCY IN THE GOOD OLD BRITISH
SPORT OF BOXING OCCASIONALLY IT IS OF SERVICE TODAY FOR EXAMPLE
I SHOULD HAVE COME TO VERY IGNOMINIOUS GRIEF WITHOUT IT
I BEGGED HIM TO TELL ME WHAT HAD OCCURRED
I FOUND THAT COUNTRY PUB WHICH I HAD ALREADY RECOMMENDED TO YOUR
NOTICE AND THERE I MADE MY DISCREET INQUIRIES I WAS IN THE BAR AND
A GARRULOUS LANDLORD WAS GIVING ME ALL THAT I WANTED WILLIAMSON IS A
WHITEBEARDED MAN AND HE LIVES ALONE WITH A SMALL STAFF OF SERVANTS
AT THE HALL THERE IS SOME RUMOUR THAT HE IS OR HAS BEEN A CLERGYMAN
BUT ONE OR TWO INCIDENTS OF HIS SHORT RESIDENCE AT THE HALL STRUCK ME
AS PECULIARLY UNECCLESIASTICAL I HAVE ALREADY MADE SOME INQUIRIES AT
A CLERICAL AGENCY AND THEY TELL ME THAT THERE WAS A MAN OF THAT NAME
IN ORDERS WHOSE CAREER HAS BEEN A SINGULARLY DARK ONE THE LANDLORD
FURTHER INFORMED ME THAT THERE ARE USUALLY WEEKEND VISITORSA WARM
LOT SIRAT THE HALL AND ESPECIALLY ONE GENTLEMAN WITH A RED
MOUSTACHE MR WOODLEY BY NAME WHO WAS ALWAYS THERE WE HAD GOT AS
FAR AS THIS WHEN WHO SHOULD WALK IN BUT THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF WHO
HAD BEEN DRINKING HIS BEER IN THE TAPROOM AND HAD HEARD THE WHOLE
CONVERSATION WHO WAS I WHAT DID I WANT WHAT DID I MEAN BY ASKING
QUESTIONS HE HAD A FINE FLOW OF LANGUAGE AND HIS ADJECTIVES WERE
VERY VIGOROUS HE ENDED A STRING OF ABUSE BY A VICIOUS BACKHANDER
WHICH I FAILED TO ENTIRELY AVOID THE NEXT FEW MINUTES WERE
DELICIOUS IT WAS A STRAIGHT LEFT AGAINST A SLOGGING RUFFIAN I
EMERGED AS YOU SEE ME MR WOODLEY WENT HOME IN A CART SO ENDED MY
COUNTRY TRIP AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT HOWEVER ENJOYABLE MY
DAY ON THE SURREY BORDER HAS NOT BEEN MUCH MORE PROFITABLE THAN YOUR
OWN
THE THURSDAY BROUGHT US ANOTHER LETTER FROM OUR CLIENT
YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED MR HOLMES SAID SHE TO HEAR THAT I AM
LEAVING MR CARRUTHERSS EMPLOYMENT EVEN THE HIGH PAY CANNOT
RECONCILE ME TO THE DISCOMFORTS OF MY SITUATION ON SATURDAY I COME
UP TO TOWN AND I DO NOT INTEND TO RETURN MR CARRUTHERS HAS GOT A
TRAP AND SO THE DANGERS OF THE LONELY ROAD IF THERE EVER WERE ANY
DANGERS ARE NOW OVER
AS TO THE SPECIAL CAUSE OF MY LEAVING IT IS NOT MERELY THE STRAINED
SITUATION WITH MR CARRUTHERS BUT IT IS THE REAPPEARANCE OF THAT
ODIOUS MAN MR WOODLEY HE WAS ALWAYS HIDEOUS BUT HE LOOKS MORE
AWFUL THAN EVER NOW FOR HE APPEARS TO HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND HE IS
MUCH DISFIGURED I SAW HIM OUT OF THE WINDOW BUT I AM GLAD TO SAY I
DID NOT MEET HIM HE HAD A LONG TALK WITH MR CARRUTHERS WHO SEEMED
MUCH EXCITED AFTERWARDS WOODLEY MUST BE STAYING IN THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR HE DID NOT SLEEP HERE AND YET I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE
OF HIM AGAIN THIS MORNING SLINKING ABOUT IN THE SHRUBBERY I WOULD
SOONER HAVE A SAVAGE WILD ANIMAL LOOSE ABOUT THE PLACE I LOATHE AND
FEAR HIM MORE THAN I CAN SAY HOW CAN MR CARRUTHERS ENDURE SUCH A
CREATURE FOR A MOMENT HOWEVER ALL MY TROUBLES WILL BE OVER ON
SATURDAY
SO I TRUST WATSON SO I TRUST SAID HOLMES GRAVELY THERE IS
SOME DEEP INTRIGUE GOING ON ROUND THAT LITTLE WOMAN AND IT IS OUR
DUTY TO SEE THAT NO ONE MOLESTS HER UPON THAT LAST JOURNEY I THINK
WATSON THAT WE MUST SPARE TIME TO RUN DOWN TOGETHER ON SATURDAY
MORNING AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS CURIOUS AND INCONCLUSIVE
INVESTIGATION HAS NO UNTOWARD ENDING
I CONFESS THAT I HAD NOT UP TO NOW TAKEN A VERY SERIOUS VIEW OF THE
CASE WHICH HAD SEEMED TO ME RATHER GROTESQUE AND BIZARRE THAN
DANGEROUS THAT A MAN SHOULD LIE IN WAIT FOR AND FOLLOW A VERY
HANDSOME WOMAN IS NO UNHEARDOF THING AND IF HE HAD SO LITTLE
AUDACITY THAT HE NOT ONLY DARED NOT ADDRESS HER BUT EVEN FLED FROM
HER APPROACH HE WAS NOT A VERY FORMIDABLE ASSAILANT THE RUFFIAN
WOODLEY WAS A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON BUT EXCEPT ON ONE OCCASION HE
HAD NOT MOLESTED OUR CLIENT AND NOW HE VISITED THE HOUSE OF
CARRUTHERS WITHOUT INTRUDING UPON HER PRESENCE THE MAN ON THE
BICYCLE WAS DOUBTLESS A MEMBER OF THOSE WEEKEND PARTIES AT THE HALL
OF WHICH THE PUBLICAN HAD SPOKEN BUT WHO HE WAS OR WHAT HE WANTED
WAS AS OBSCURE AS EVER IT WAS THE SEVERITY OF HOLMESS MANNER AND
THE FACT THAT HE SLIPPED A REVOLVER INTO HIS POCKET BEFORE LEAVING
OUR ROOMS WHICH IMPRESSED ME WITH THE FEELING THAT TRAGEDY MIGHT
PROVE TO LURK BEHIND THIS CURIOUS TRAIN OF EVENTS
A RAINY NIGHT HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY A GLORIOUS MORNING AND THE
HEATHCOVERED COUNTRYSIDE WITH THE GLOWING CLUMPS OF FLOWERING GORSE
SEEMED ALL THE MORE BEAUTIFUL TO EYES WHICH WERE WEARY OF THE DUNS
AND DRABS AND SLATEGREYS OF LONDON HOLMES AND I WALKED ALONG THE
BROAD SANDY ROAD INHALING THE FRESH MORNING AIR AND REJOICING IN
THE MUSIC OF THE BIRDS AND THE FRESH BREATH OF THE SPRING FROM A
RISE OF THE ROAD ON THE SHOULDER OF CROOKSBURY HILL WE COULD SEE THE
GRIM HALL BRISTLING OUT FROM AMIDST THE ANCIENT OAKS WHICH OLD AS
THEY WERE WERE STILL YOUNGER THAN THE BUILDING WHICH THEY
SURROUNDED HOLMES POINTED DOWN THE LONG TRACT OF ROAD WHICH WOUND A
REDDISH YELLOW BAND BETWEEN THE BROWN OF THE HEATH AND THE BUDDING
GREEN OF THE WOODS FAR AWAY A BLACK DOT WE COULD SEE A VEHICLE
MOVING IN OUR DIRECTION HOLMES GAVE AN EXCLAMATION OF IMPATIENCE
I HAD GIVEN A MARGIN OF HALF AN HOUR SAID HE IF THAT IS HER TRAP
SHE MUST BE MAKING FOR THE EARLIER TRAIN I FEAR WATSON THAT SHE
WILL BE PAST CHARLINGTON BEFORE WE CAN POSSIBLY MEET HER
FROM THE INSTANT THAT WE PASSED THE RISE WE COULD NO LONGER SEE THE
VEHICLE BUT WE HASTENED ONWARDS AT SUCH A PACE THAT MY SEDENTARY
LIFE BEGAN TO TELL UPON ME AND I WAS COMPELLED TO FALL BEHIND
HOLMES HOWEVER WAS ALWAYS IN TRAINING FOR HE HAD INEXHAUSTIBLE
STORES OF NERVOUS ENERGY UPON WHICH TO DRAW HIS SPRINGY STEP NEVER
SLOWED UNTIL SUDDENLY WHEN HE WAS A HUNDRED YARDS IN FRONT OF ME HE
HALTED AND I SAW HIM THROW UP HIS HAND WITH A GESTURE OF GRIEF AND
DESPAIR AT THE SAME INSTANT AN EMPTY DOGCART THE HORSE CANTERING
THE REINS TRAILING APPEARED ROUND THE CURVE OF THE ROAD AND RATTLED
SWIFTLY TOWARDS US
TOO LATE WATSON TOO LATE CRIED HOLMES AS I RAN PANTING TO HIS
SIDE FOOL THAT I WAS NOT TO ALLOW FOR THAT EARLIER TRAIN ITS
ABDUCTION WATSONABDUCTION MURDER HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT BLOCK THE
ROAD STOP THE HORSE THATS RIGHT NOW JUMP IN AND LET US SEE IF I
CAN REPAIR THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY OWN BLUNDER
WE HAD SPRUNG INTO THE DOGCART AND HOLMES AFTER TURNING THE HORSE
GAVE IT A SHARP CUT WITH THE WHIP AND WE FLEW BACK ALONG THE ROAD
AS WE TURNED THE CURVE THE WHOLE STRETCH OF ROAD BETWEEN THE HALL AND
THE HEATH WAS OPENED UP I GRASPED HOLMESS ARM
THATS THE MAN I GASPED
A SOLITARY CYCLIST WAS COMING TOWARDS US HIS HEAD WAS DOWN AND HIS
SHOULDERS ROUNDED AS HE PUT EVERY OUNCE OF ENERGY THAT HE POSSESSED
ON TO THE PEDALS HE WAS FLYING LIKE A RACER SUDDENLY HE RAISED HIS
BEARDED FACE SAW US CLOSE TO HIM AND PULLED UP SPRINGING FROM HIS
MACHINE THAT COALBLACK BEARD WAS IN SINGULAR CONTRAST TO THE PALLOR
OF HIS FACE AND HIS EYES WERE AS BRIGHT AS IF HE HAD A FEVER HE
STARED AT US AND AT THE DOGCART THEN A LOOK OF AMAZEMENT CAME OVER
HIS FACE
HALLOA STOP THERE HE SHOUTED HOLDING HIS BICYCLE TO BLOCK OUR
ROAD WHERE DID YOU GET THAT DOGCART PULL UP MAN HE YELLED
DRAWING A PISTOL FROM HIS SIDE POCKET PULL UP I SAY OR BY
GEORGE ILL PUT A BULLET INTO YOUR HORSE
HOLMES THREW THE REINS INTO MY LAP AND SPRANG DOWN FROM THE CART
YOURE THE MAN WE WANT TO SEE WHERE IS MISS VIOLET SMITH HE SAID
IN HIS QUICK CLEAR WAY
THATS WHAT I AM ASKING YOU YOURE IN HER DOGCART YOU OUGHT TO
KNOW WHERE SHE IS
WE MET THE DOGCART ON THE ROAD THERE WAS NO ONE IN IT WE DROVE
BACK TO HELP THE YOUNG LADY
GOOD LORD GOOD LORD WHAT SHALL I DO CRIED THE STRANGER IN AN
ECSTASY OF DESPAIR THEYVE GOT HER THAT HELLHOUND WOODLEY AND THE
BLACKGUARD PARSON COME MAN COME IF YOU REALLY ARE HER FRIEND
STAND BY ME AND WELL SAVE HER IF I HAVE TO LEAVE MY CARCASS IN
CHARLINGTON WOOD
HE RAN DISTRACTEDLY HIS PISTOL IN HIS HAND TOWARDS A GAP IN THE
HEDGE HOLMES FOLLOWED HIM AND I LEAVING THE HORSE GRAZING BESIDE
THE ROAD FOLLOWED HOLMES
THIS IS WHERE THEY CAME THROUGH SAID HE POINTING TO THE MARKS OF
SEVERAL FEET UPON THE MUDDY PATH HALLOA STOP A MINUTE WHOS THIS
IN THE BUSH

LEATHER CORDS AND GAITERS HE LAY UPON HIS BACK HIS KNEES DRAWN UP

THATS PETER THE GROOM CRIED THE STRANGER HE DROVE HER THE
BEASTS HAVE PULLED HIM OFF AND CLUBBED HIM LET HIM LIE WE CANT DO
HIM ANY GOOD BUT WE MAY SAVE HER FROM THE WORST FATE THAT CAN BEFALL
A WOMAN
WE RAN FRANTICALLY DOWN THE PATH WHICH WOUND AMONG THE TREES WE HAD
REACHED THE SHRUBBERY WHICH SURROUNDED THE HOUSE WHEN HOLMES PULLED
UP
THEY DIDNT GO TO THE HOUSE HERE ARE THEIR MARKS ON THE LEFTHERE
BESIDE THE LAUREL BUSHES AH I SAID SO
AS HE SPOKE A WOMANS SHRILL SCREAMA SCREAM WHICH VIBRATED WITH A
FRENZY OF HORRORBURST FROM THE THICK GREEN CLUMP OF BUSHES IN FRONT
OF US IT ENDED SUDDENLY ON ITS HIGHEST NOTE WITH A CHOKE AND A
GURGLE
THIS WAY THIS WAY THEY ARE IN THE BOWLING ALLEY CRIED THE
STRANGER DARTING THROUGH THE BUSHES AH THE COWARDLY DOGS FOLLOW
ME GENTLEMEN TOO LATE TOO LATE BY THE LIVING JINGO
WE HAD BROKEN SUDDENLY INTO A LOVELY GLADE OF GREENSWARD SURROUNDED
BY ANCIENT TREES ON THE FARTHER SIDE OF IT UNDER THE SHADOW OF A
MIGHTY OAK THERE STOOD A SINGULAR GROUP OF THREE PEOPLE ONE WAS A

THEN YOU GOT IT BY A TRICK BUT IN ANY CASE A FORCED MARRIAGE IS NO
MARRIAGE BUT IT IS A VERY SERIOUS FELONY AS YOU WILL DISCOVER
BEFORE YOU HAVE FINISHED YOULL HAVE TIME TO THINK THE POINT OUT
DURING THE NEXT TEN YEARS OR SO UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN AS TO YOU
CARRUTHERS YOU WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO KEEP YOUR PISTOL IN YOUR
POCKET
I BEGIN TO THINK SO MR HOLMES BUT WHEN I THOUGHT OF ALL THE
PRECAUTION I HAD TAKEN TO SHIELD THIS GIRLFOR I LOVED HER MR
HOLMES AND IT IS THE ONLY TIME THAT EVER I KNEW WHAT LOVE WASIT
FAIRLY DROVE ME MAD TO THINK THAT SHE WAS IN THE POWER OF THE
GREATEST BRUTE AND BULLY IN SOUTH AFRICA A MAN WHOSE NAME IS A HOLY
TERROR FROM KIMBERLEY TO JOHANNESBURG WHY MR HOLMES YOULL HARDLY
BELIEVE IT BUT EVER SINCE THAT GIRL HAS BEEN IN MY EMPLOYMENT I
NEVER ONCE LET HER GO PAST THIS HOUSE WHERE I KNEW THESE RASCALS
WERE LURKING WITHOUT FOLLOWING HER ON MY BICYCLE JUST TO SEE THAT
SHE CAME TO NO HARM I KEPT MY DISTANCE FROM HER AND I WORE A BEARD
SO THAT SHE SHOULD NOT RECOGNISE ME FOR SHE IS A GOOD AND
HIGHSPIRITED GIRL AND SHE WOULDNT HAVE STAYED IN MY EMPLOYMENT
LONG IF SHE HAD THOUGHT THAT I WAS FOLLOWING HER ABOUT THE COUNTRY
ROADS
WHY DIDNT YOU TELL HER OF HER DANGER
BECAUSE THEN AGAIN SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT ME AND I COULDNT BEAR TO
FACE THAT EVEN IF SHE COULDNT LOVE ME IT WAS A GREAT DEAL TO ME
JUST TO SEE HER DAINTY FORM ABOUT THE HOUSE AND TO HEAR THE SOUND OF
HER VOICE
WELL SAID I YOU CALL THAT LOVE MR CARRUTHERS BUT I SHOULD
CALL IT SELFISHNESS
MAYBE THE TWO THINGS GO TOGETHER ANYHOW I COULDNT LET HER GO
BESIDES WITH THIS CROWD ABOUT IT WAS WELL THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE
SOMEONE NEAR TO LOOK AFTER HER THEN WHEN THE CABLE CAME I KNEW THEY
WERE BOUND TO MAKE A MOVE
WHAT CABLE
CARRUTHERS TOOK A TELEGRAM FROM HIS POCKET
THATS IT SAID HE
IT WAS SHORT AND CONCISE
THE OLD MAN IS DEAD
HUM SAID HOLMES I THINK I SEE HOW THINGS WORKED AND I CAN
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS MESSAGE WOULD AS YOU SAY BRING THEM TO A HEAD
BUT WHILE WE WAIT YOU MIGHT TELL ME WHAT YOU CAN
THE OLD REPROBATE WITH THE SURPLICE BURST INTO A VOLLEY OF BAD
LANGUAGE
BY HEAVEN SAID HE IF YOU SQUEAL ON US BOB CARRUTHERS ILL
SERVE YOU AS YOU SERVED JACK WOODLEY YOU CAN BLEAT ABOUT THE GIRL TO
YOUR HEARTS CONTENT FOR THATS YOUR OWN AFFAIR BUT IF YOU ROUND ON
YOUR PALS TO THIS PLAINCLOTHES COPPER IT WILL BE THE WORST DAYS
WORK THAT EVER YOU DID
YOUR REVERENCE NEED NOT BE EXCITED SAID HOLMES LIGHTING A
CIGARETTE THE CASE IS CLEAR ENOUGH AGAINST YOU AND ALL I ASK IS A
FEW DETAILS FOR MY PRIVATE CURIOSITY HOWEVER IF THERES ANY
DIFFICULTY IN YOUR TELLING ME ILL DO THE TALKING AND THEN YOU WILL
SEE HOW FAR YOU HAVE A CHANCE OF HOLDING BACK YOUR SECRETS IN THE
FIRST PLACE THREE OF YOU CAME FROM SOUTH AFRICA ON THIS GAMEYOU
WILLIAMSON YOU CARRUTHERS AND WOODLEY
LIE NUMBER ONE SAID THE OLD MAN I NEVER SAW EITHER OF THEM UNTIL
TWO MONTHS AGO AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN AFRICA IN MY LIFE SO YOU
CAN PUT THAT IN YOUR PIPE AND SMOKE IT MR BUSYBODY HOLMES
WHAT HE SAYS IS TRUE SAID CARRUTHERS
WELL WELL TWO OF YOU CAME OVER HIS REVERENCE IS OUR OWN HOMEMADE
ARTICLE YOU HAD KNOWN RALPH SMITH IN SOUTH AFRICA YOU HAD REASON TO
BELIEVE HE WOULD NOT LIVE LONG YOU FOUND OUT THAT HIS NIECE WOULD
INHERIT HIS FORTUNE HOWS THATEH
CARRUTHERS NODDED AND WILLIAMSON SWORE
SHE WAS NEXTOFKIN NO DOUBT AND YOU WERE AWARE THAT THE OLD
FELLOW WOULD MAKE NO WILL
COULDNT READ OR WRITE SAID CARRUTHERS
SO YOU CAME OVER THE TWO OF YOU AND HUNTED UP THE GIRL THE IDEA
WAS THAT ONE OF YOU WAS TO MARRY HER AND THE OTHER HAVE A SHARE OF
THE PLUNDER FOR SOME REASON WOODLEY WAS CHOSEN AS THE HUSBAND WHY
WAS THAT
WE PLAYED CARDS FOR HER ON THE VOYAGE HE WON
I SEE YOU GOT THE YOUNG LADY INTO YOUR SERVICE AND THERE WOODLEY
WAS TO DO THE COURTING SHE RECOGNISED THE DRUNKEN BRUTE THAT HE WAS
AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM MEANWHILE YOUR ARRANGEMENT
WAS RATHER UPSET BY THE FACT THAT YOU HAD YOURSELF FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH THE LADY YOU COULD NO LONGER BEAR THE IDEA OF THIS RUFFIAN
OWNING HER
NO BY GEORGE I COULDNT
THERE WAS A QUARREL BETWEEN YOU HE LEFT YOU IN A RAGE AND BEGAN TO
MAKE HIS OWN PLANS INDEPENDENTLY OF YOU
IT STRIKES ME WILLIAMSON THERE ISNT VERY MUCH THAT WE CAN TELL
THIS GENTLEMAN CRIED CARRUTHERS WITH A BITTER LAUGH YES WE
QUARRELED AND HE KNOCKED ME DOWN I AM LEVEL WITH HIM ON THAT
ANYHOW THEN I LOST SIGHT OF HIM THAT WAS WHEN HE PICKED UP WITH
THIS CAST PADRE HERE I FOUND THAT THEY HAD SET UP HOUSEKEEPING
TOGETHER AT THIS PLACE ON THE LINE THAT SHE HAD TO PASS FOR THE
STATION I KEPT MY EYE ON HER AFTER THAT FOR I KNEW THERE WAS SOME
DEVILRY IN THE WIND I SAW THEM FROM TIME TO TIME FOR I WAS ANXIOUS
TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE AFTER TWO DAYS AGO WOODLEY CAME UP TO MY
HOUSE WITH THIS CABLE WHICH SHOWED THAT RALPH SMITH WAS DEAD HE
ASKED ME IF I WOULD STAND BY THE BARGAIN I SAID I WOULD NOT HE
ASKED ME IF I WOULD MARRY THE GIRL MYSELF AND GIVE HIM A SHARE I
SAID I WOULD WILLINGLY DO SO BUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ME HE
SAID LET US GET HER MARRIED FIRST AND AFTER A WEEK OR TWO SHE MAY
SEE THINGS A BIT DIFFERENT I SAID I WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
VIOLENCE SO HE WENT OFF CURSING LIKE THE FOULMOUTHED BLACKGUARD
THAT HE WAS AND SWEARING THAT HE WOULD HAVE HER YET SHE WAS LEAVING
ME THIS WEEKEND AND I HAD GOT A TRAP TO TAKE HER TO THE STATION
BUT I WAS SO UNEASY IN MY MIND THAT I FOLLOWED HER ON MY BICYCLE SHE
HAD GOT A START HOWEVER AND BEFORE I COULD CATCH HER THE MISCHIEF
WAS DONE THE FIRST THING I KNEW ABOUT IT WAS WHEN I SAW YOU TWO
GENTLEMEN DRIVING BACK IN HER DOGCART
HOLMES ROSE AND TOSSED THE END OF HIS CIGARETTE INTO THE GRATE I
HAVE BEEN VERY OBTUSE WATSON SAID HE WHEN IN YOUR REPORT YOU
SAID THAT YOU HAD SEEN THE CYCLIST AS YOU THOUGHT ARRANGE HIS NECKTIE
IN THE SHRUBBERY THAT ALONE SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME ALL HOWEVER WE MAY
CONGRATULATE OURSELVES UPON A CURIOUS AND IN SOME RESPECTS A UNIQUE
CASE I PERCEIVE THREE OF THE COUNTY CONSTABULARY IN THE DRIVE AND I
AM GLAD TO SEE THAT THE LITTLE OSTLER IS ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH THEM
SO IT IS LIKELY THAT NEITHER HE NOR THE INTERESTING BRIDEGROOM WILL
BE PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY THEIR MORNINGS ADVENTURES I THINK
WATSON THAT IN YOUR MEDICAL CAPACITY YOU MIGHT WAIT UPON MISS SMITH
AND TELL HER THAT IF SHE IS SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED WE SHALL BE HAPPY
TO ESCORT HER TO HER MOTHERS HOME IF SHE IS NOT QUITE CONVALESCENT
YOU WILL FIND THAT A HINT THAT WE WERE ABOUT TO TELEGRAPH TO A YOUNG
ELECTRICIAN IN THE MIDLANDS WOULD PROBABLY COMPLETE THE CURE AS TO
YOU MR CARRUTHERS I THINK THAT YOU HAVE DONE WHAT YOU COULD TO
MAKE AMENDS FOR YOUR SHARE IN AN EVIL PLOT THERE IS MY CARD SIR
AND IF MY EVIDENCE CAN BE OF HELP TO YOU IN YOUR TRIAL IT SHALL BE AT
YOUR DISPOSAL
IN THE WHIRL OF OUR INCESSANT ACTIVITY IT HAS OFTEN BEEN DIFFICULT
FOR ME AS THE READER HAS PROBABLY OBSERVED TO ROUND OFF MY
NARRATIVES AND TO GIVE THOSE FINAL DETAILS WHICH THE CURIOUS MIGHT
EXPECT EACH CASE HAS BEEN THE PRELUDE TO ANOTHER AND THE CRISIS
ONCE OVER THE ACTORS HAVE PASSED FOR EVER OUT OF OUR BUSY LIVES I
FIND HOWEVER A SHORT NOTE AT THE END OF MY MANUSCRIPTS DEALING WITH
THIS CASE IN WHICH I HAVE PUT IT UPON RECORD THAT MISS VIOLET SMITH
DID INDEED INHERIT A LARGE FORTUNE AND THAT SHE IS NOW THE WIFE OF
CYRIL MORTON THE SENIOR PARTNER OF MORTON KENNEDY THE FAMOUS
WESTMINSTER ELECTRICIANS WILLIAMSON AND WOODLEY WERE BOTH TRIED FOR
ABDUCTION AND ASSAULT THE FORMER GETTING SEVEN YEARS AND THE LATTER
TEN OF THE FATE OF CARRUTHERS I HAVE NO RECORD BUT I AM SURE THAT
HIS ASSAULT WAS NOT VIEWED VERY GRAVELY BY THE COURT SINCE WOODLEY
HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING A MOST DANGEROUS RUFFIAN AND I THINK
THAT A FEW MONTHS WERE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE DEMANDS OF JUSTICE
THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL
WE HAVE HAD SOME DRAMATIC ENTRANCES AND EXITS UPON OUR SMALL STAGE AT
BAKER STREET BUT I CANNOT RECOLLECT ANYTHING MORE SUDDEN AND
STARTLING THAN THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THORNEYCROFT HUXTABLE MA
PHD ETC HIS CARD WHICH SEEMED TOO SMALL TO CARRY THE WEIGHT OF
HIS ACADEMIC DISTINCTIONS PRECEDED HIM BY A FEW SECONDS AND THEN HE
ENTERED HIMSELFSO LARGE SO POMPOUS AND SO DIGNIFIED THAT HE WAS
THE VERY EMBODIMENT OF SELFPOSSESSION AND SOLIDITY AND YET HIS
FIRST ACTION WHEN THE DOOR HAD CLOSED BEHIND HIM WAS TO STAGGER
AGAINST THE TABLE WHENCE HE SLIPPED DOWN UPON THE FLOOR AND THERE
WAS THAT MAJESTIC FIGURE PROSTRATE AND INSENSIBLE UPON OUR BEARSKIN
HEARTHRUG
WE HAD SPRUNG TO OUR FEET AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS WE STARED IN SILENT
AMAZEMENT AT THIS PONDEROUS PIECE OF WRECKAGE WHICH TOLD OF SOME
SUDDEN AND FATAL STORM FAR OUT ON THE OCEAN OF LIFE THEN HOLMES
HURRIED WITH A CUSHION FOR HIS HEAD AND I WITH BRANDY FOR HIS LIPS
THE HEAVY WHITE FACE WAS SEAMED WITH LINES OF TROUBLE THE HANGING
POUCHES UNDER THE CLOSED EYES WERE LEADEN IN COLOUR THE LOOSE MOUTH
DROOPED DOLOROUSLY AT THE CORNERS THE ROLLING CHINS WERE UNSHAVEN
COLLAR AND SHIRT BORE THE GRIME OF A LONG JOURNEY AND THE HAIR
BRISTLED UNKEMPT FROM THE WELLSHAPED HEAD IT WAS A SORELYSTRICKEN
MAN WHO LAY BEFORE US
WHAT IS IT WATSON ASKED HOLMES
ABSOLUTE EXHAUSTIONPOSSIBLY MERE HUNGER AND FATIGUE SAID I WITH
MY FINGER ON THE THREADY PULSE WHERE THE STREAM OF LIFE TRICKLED
THIN AND SMALL
RETURN TICKET FROM MACKLETON IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND SAID HOLMES
DRAWING IT FROM THE WATCHPOCKET IT IS NOT TWELVE OCLOCK YET HE
HAS CERTAINLY BEEN AN EARLY STARTER
THE PUCKERED EYELIDS HAD BEGUN TO QUIVER AND NOW A PAIR OF VACANT
GREY EYES LOOKED UP AT US AN INSTANT LATER THE MAN HAD SCRAMBLED ON
TO HIS FEET HIS FACE CRIMSON WITH SHAME
FORGIVE THIS WEAKNESS MR HOLMES I HAVE BEEN A LITTLE OVERWROUGHT
THANK YOU IF I MIGHT HAVE A GLASS OF MILK AND A BISCUIT I HAVE NO
DOUBT THAT I SHOULD BE BETTER I CAME PERSONALLY MR HOLMES IN
ORDER TO ENSURE THAT YOU WOULD RETURN WITH ME I FEARED THAT NO
TELEGRAM WOULD CONVINCE YOU OF THE ABSOLUTE URGENCY OF THE CASE
WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RESTORED
I AM QUITE WELL AGAIN I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW I CAME TO BE SO WEAK I
WISH YOU MR HOLMES TO COME TO MACKLETON WITH ME BY THE NEXT
TRAIN
MY FRIEND SHOOK HIS HEAD
MY COLLEAGUE DR WATSON COULD TELL YOU THAT WE ARE VERY BUSY AT
PRESENT I AM RETAINED IN THIS CASE OF THE FERRERS DOCUMENTS AND THE
ABERGAVENNY MURDER IS COMING UP FOR TRIAL ONLY A VERY IMPORTANT
ISSUE COULD CALL ME FROM LONDON AT PRESENT
IMPORTANT OUR VISITOR THREW UP HIS HANDS HAVE YOU HEARD NOTHING
OF THE ABDUCTION OF THE ONLY SON OF THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE
WHAT THE LATE CABINET MINISTER
EXACTLY WE HAD TRIED TO KEEP IT OUT OF THE PAPERS BUT THERE WAS
SOME RUMOUR IN THE GLOBE LAST NIGHT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE REACHED
YOUR EARS
HOLMES SHOT OUT HIS LONG THIN ARM AND PICKED OUT VOLUME H IN HIS
ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF REFERENCE
HOLDERNESSE TH DUKE KG PCHALF THE ALPHABET BARON
BEVERLEY EARL OF CARSTONDEAR ME WHAT A LIST LORD LIEUTENANT OF
HALLAMSHIRE SINCE MARRIED EDITH DAUGHTER OF SIR CHARLES
APPLEDORE HEIR AND ONLY CHILD LORD SALTIRE OWNS ABOUT TWO
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES MINERALS IN LANCASHIRE AND WALES
ADDRESS CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE HOLDERNESSE HALL HALLAMSHIRE
CARSTON CASTLE BANGOR WALES LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY CHIEF
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WELL WELL THIS MAN IS CERTAINLY ONE OF
THE GREATEST SUBJECTS OF THE CROWN
THE GREATEST AND PERHAPS THE WEALTHIEST I AM AWARE MR HOLMES
THAT YOU TAKE A VERY HIGH LINE IN PROFESSIONAL MATTERS AND THAT YOU
ARE PREPARED TO WORK FOR THE WORKS SAKE I MAY TELL YOU HOWEVER
THAT HIS GRACE HAS ALREADY INTIMATED THAT A CHEQUE FOR FIVE THOUSAND
POUNDS WILL BE HANDED OVER TO THE PERSON WHO CAN TELL HIM WHERE HIS
SON IS AND ANOTHER THOUSAND TO HIM WHO CAN NAME THE MAN OR MEN WHO
HAVE TAKEN HIM
IT IS A PRINCELY OFFER SAID HOLMES WATSON I THINK THAT WE SHALL
ACCOMPANY DR HUXTABLE BACK TO THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND NOW DR
HUXTABLE WHEN YOU HAVE CONSUMED THAT MILK YOU WILL KINDLY TELL ME
WHAT HAS HAPPENED WHEN IT HAPPENED HOW IT HAPPENED AND FINALLY
WHAT DR THORNEYCROFT HUXTABLE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL NEAR MACKLETON
HAS TO DO WITH THE MATTER AND WHY HE COMES THREE DAYS AFTER AN
EVENTTHE STATE OF YOUR CHIN GIVES THE DATETO ASK FOR MY HUMBLE
SERVICES
OUR VISITOR HAD CONSUMED HIS MILK AND BISCUITS THE LIGHT HAD COME
BACK TO HIS EYES AND THE COLOUR TO HIS CHEEKS AS HE SET HIMSELF WITH
GREAT VIGOUR AND LUCIDITY TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION
I MUST INFORM YOU GENTLEMEN THAT THE PRIORY IS A PREPARATORY
SCHOOL OF WHICH I AM THE FOUNDER AND PRINCIPAL HUXTABLES
SIDELIGHTS ON HORACE MAY POSSIBLY RECALL MY NAME TO YOUR MEMORIES
THE PRIORY IS WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE BEST AND MOST SELECT
PREPARATORY SCHOOL IN ENGLAND LORD LEVERSTOKE THE EARL OF
BLACKWATER SIR CATHCART SOAMESTHEY ALL HAVE ENTRUSTED THEIR SONS
TO ME BUT I FELT THAT MY SCHOOL HAD REACHED ITS ZENITH WHEN THREE
WEEKS AGO THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE SENT MR JAMES WILDER HIS
SECRETARY WITH THE INTIMATION THAT YOUNG LORD SALTIRE TEN YEARS
OLD HIS ONLY SON AND HEIR WAS ABOUT TO BE COMMITTED TO MY CHARGE
LITTLE DID I THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE THE PRELUDE TO THE MOST
CRUSHING MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE
ON MAY ST THE BOY ARRIVED THAT BEING THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER
TERM HE WAS A CHARMING YOUTH AND HE SOON FELL INTO OUR WAYS I MAY
TELL YOUI TRUST THAT I AM NOT INDISCREET BUT HALFCONFIDENCES ARE
ABSURD IN SUCH A CASETHAT HE WAS NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY AT HOME IT IS
AN OPEN SECRET THAT THE DUKES MARRIED LIFE HAD NOT BEEN A PEACEFUL
ONE AND THE MATTER HAD ENDED IN A SEPARATION BY MUTUAL CONSENT THE
DUCHESS TAKING UP HER RESIDENCE IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE THIS HAD
OCCURRED VERY SHORTLY BEFORE AND THE BOYS SYMPATHIES ARE KNOWN TO
HAVE BEEN STRONGLY WITH HIS MOTHER HE MOPED AFTER HER DEPARTURE FROM
HOLDERNESSE HALL AND IT WAS FOR THIS REASON THAT THE DUKE DESIRED TO
SEND HIM TO MY ESTABLISHMENT IN A FORTNIGHT THE BOY WAS QUITE AT
HOME WITH US AND WAS APPARENTLY ABSOLUTELY HAPPY
HE WAS LAST SEEN ON THE NIGHT OF MAY THTHAT IS THE NIGHT OF
LAST MONDAY HIS ROOM WAS ON THE SECOND FLOOR AND WAS APPROACHED
THROUGH ANOTHER LARGER ROOM IN WHICH TWO BOYS WERE SLEEPING THESE
BOYS SAW AND HEARD NOTHING SO THAT IT IS CERTAIN THAT YOUNG SALTIRE
DID NOT PASS OUT THAT WAY HIS WINDOW WAS OPEN AND THERE IS A STOUT
IVY PLANT LEADING TO THE GROUND WE COULD TRACE NO FOOTMARKS BELOW
BUT IT IS SURE THAT THIS IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE EXIT
HIS ABSENCE WAS DISCOVERED AT SEVEN OCLOCK ON TUESDAY MORNING HIS
BED HAD BEEN SLEPT IN HE HAD DRESSED HIMSELF FULLY BEFORE GOING OFF
IN HIS USUAL SCHOOL SUIT OF BLACK ETON JACKET AND DARK GREY TROUSERS
THERE WERE NO SIGNS THAT ANYONE HAD ENTERED THE ROOM AND IT IS QUITE
CERTAIN THAT ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF CRIES OR A STRUGGLE WOULD
HAVE BEEN HEARD SINCE CAUNTER THE ELDER BOY IN THE INNER ROOM IS A
VERY LIGHT SLEEPER
WHEN LORD SALTIRES DISAPPEARANCE WAS DISCOVERED I AT ONCE CALLED A
ROLL OF THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT BOYS MASTERS AND SERVANTS IT WAS
THEN THAT WE ASCERTAINED THAT LORD SALTIRE HAD NOT BEEN ALONE IN HIS
FLIGHT HEIDEGGER THE GERMAN MASTER WAS MISSING HIS ROOM WAS ON
THE SECOND FLOOR AT THE FARTHER END OF THE BUILDING FACING THE SAME
WAY AS LORD SALTIRES HIS BED HAD ALSO BEEN SLEPT IN BUT HE HAD
APPARENTLY GONE AWAY PARTLY DRESSED SINCE HIS SHIRT AND SOCKS WERE
LYING ON THE FLOOR HE HAD UNDOUBTEDLY LET HIMSELF DOWN BY THE IVY
FOR WE COULD SEE THE MARKS OF HIS FEET WHERE HE HAD LANDED ON THE
LAWN HIS BICYCLE WAS KEPT IN A SMALL SHED BESIDE THIS LAWN AND IT
ALSO WAS GONE
HE HAD BEEN WITH ME FOR TWO YEARS AND CAME WITH THE BEST
REFERENCES BUT HE WAS A SILENT MOROSE MAN NOT VERY POPULAR EITHER
WITH MASTERS OR BOYS NO TRACE COULD BE FOUND OF THE FUGITIVES AND
NOW ON THURSDAY MORNING WE ARE AS IGNORANT AS WE WERE ON TUESDAY
INQUIRY WAS OF COURSE MADE AT ONCE AT HOLDERNESSE HALL IT IS ONLY
A FEW MILES AWAY AND WE IMAGINED THAT IN SOME SUDDEN ATTACK OF
HOMESICKNESS HE HAD GONE BACK TO HIS FATHER BUT NOTHING HAD BEEN
HEARD OF HIM THE DUKE IS GREATLY AGITATEDAND AS TO ME YOU HAVE
SEEN YOURSELVES THE STATE OF NERVOUS PROSTRATION TO WHICH THE
SUSPENSE AND THE RESPONSIBILITY HAVE REDUCED ME MR HOLMES IF EVER
YOU PUT FORWARD YOUR FULL POWERS I IMPLORE YOU TO DO SO NOW FOR
NEVER IN YOUR LIFE COULD YOU HAVE A CASE WHICH IS MORE WORTHY OF
THEM
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD LISTENED WITH THE UTMOST INTENTNESS TO THE
STATEMENT OF THE UNHAPPY SCHOOLMASTER HIS DRAWN BROWS AND THE DEEP
FURROW BETWEEN THEM SHOWED THAT HE NEEDED NO EXHORTATION TO
CONCENTRATE ALL HIS ATTENTION UPON A PROBLEM WHICH APART FROM THE
TREMENDOUS INTERESTS INVOLVED MUST APPEAL SO DIRECTLY TO HIS LOVE OF
THE COMPLEX AND THE UNUSUAL HE NOW DREW OUT HIS NOTEBOOK AND JOTTED
DOWN ONE OR TWO MEMORANDA
YOU HAVE BEEN VERY REMISS IN NOT COMING TO ME SOONER SAID HE
SEVERELY YOU START ME ON MY INVESTIGATION WITH A VERY SERIOUS
HANDICAP IT IS INCONCEIVABLE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THIS IVY AND THIS
LAWN WOULD HAVE YIELDED NOTHING TO AN EXPERT OBSERVER
I AM NOT TO BLAME MR HOLMES HIS GRACE WAS EXTREMELY DESIROUS TO
AVOID ALL PUBLIC SCANDAL HE WAS AFRAID OF HIS FAMILY UNHAPPINESS
BEING DRAGGED BEFORE THE WORLD HE HAS A DEEP HORROR OF ANYTHING OF
THE KIND
BUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION
YES SIR AND IT HAS PROVED MOST DISAPPOINTING AN APPARENT CLUE WAS
AT ONCE OBTAINED SINCE A BOY AND A YOUNG MAN WERE REPORTED TO HAVE
BEEN SEEN LEAVING A NEIGHBOURING STATION BY AN EARLY TRAIN ONLY LAST
NIGHT WE HAD NEWS THAT THE COUPLE HAD BEEN HUNTED DOWN IN LIVERPOOL
AND THEY PROVE TO HAVE NO CONNECTION WHATEVER WITH THE MATTER IN
HAND THEN IT WAS THAT IN MY DESPAIR AND DISAPPOINTMENT AFTER A
SLEEPLESS NIGHT I CAME STRAIGHT TO YOU BY THE EARLY TRAIN
I SUPPOSE THE LOCAL INVESTIGATION WAS RELAXED WHILE THIS FALSE CLUE
WAS BEING FOLLOWED UP
IT WAS ENTIRELY DROPPED
SO THAT THREE DAYS HAVE BEEN WASTED THE AFFAIR HAS BEEN MOST
DEPLORABLY HANDLED
I FEEL IT AND ADMIT IT
AND YET THE PROBLEM SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF ULTIMATE SOLUTION I SHALL
BE VERY HAPPY TO LOOK INTO IT HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO TRACE ANY
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MISSING BOY AND THIS GERMAN MASTER
NONE AT ALL
WAS HE IN THE MASTERS CLASS
NO HE NEVER EXCHANGED A WORD WITH HIM SO FAR AS I KNOW
THAT IS CERTAINLY VERY SINGULAR HAD THE BOY A BICYCLE
NO
WAS ANY OTHER BICYCLE MISSING
NO
IS THAT CERTAIN
QUITE
WELL NOW YOU DO NOT MEAN TO SERIOUSLY SUGGEST THAT THIS GERMAN
RODE OFF UPON A BICYCLE IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT BEARING THE BOY IN
HIS ARMS
CERTAINLY NOT
THEN WHAT IS THE THEORY IN YOUR MIND
THE BICYCLE MAY HAVE BEEN A BLIND IT MAY HAVE BEEN HIDDEN SOMEWHERE
AND THE PAIR GONE OFF ON FOOT
QUITE SO BUT IT SEEMS RATHER AN ABSURD BLIND DOES IT NOT WERE
THERE OTHER BICYCLES IN THIS SHED
SEVERAL
WOULD HE NOT HAVE HIDDEN A COUPLE HE DESIRED TO GIVE THE IDEA THAT
THEY HAD GONE OFF UPON THEM
I SUPPOSE HE WOULD
OF COURSE HE WOULD THE BLIND THEORY WONT DO BUT THE INCIDENT IS
AN ADMIRABLE STARTINGPOINT FOR AN INVESTIGATION AFTER ALL A
BICYCLE IS NOT AN EASY THING TO CONCEAL OR TO DESTROY ONE OTHER
QUESTION DID ANYONE CALL TO SEE THE BOY ON THE DAY BEFORE HE
DISAPPEARED
NO
DID HE GET ANY LETTERS
YES ONE LETTER
FROM WHOM
FROM HIS FATHER
DO YOU OPEN THE BOYS LETTERS
NO
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WAS FROM THE FATHER
THE COAT OF ARMS WAS ON THE ENVELOPE AND IT WAS ADDRESSED IN THE
DUKES PECULIAR STIFF HAND BESIDES THE DUKE REMEMBERS HAVING
WRITTEN
WHEN HAD HE A LETTER BEFORE THAT
NOT FOR SEVERAL DAYS
HAD HE EVER ONE FROM FRANCE
NO NEVER
YOU SEE THE POINT OF MY QUESTIONS OF COURSE EITHER THE BOY WAS
CARRIED OFF BY FORCE OR HE WENT OF HIS OWN FREE WILL IN THE LATTER
CASE YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT SOME PROMPTING FROM OUTSIDE WOULD BE
NEEDED TO MAKE SO YOUNG A LAD DO SUCH A THING IF HE HAS HAD NO
VISITORS THAT PROMPTING MUST HAVE COME IN LETTERS HENCE I TRY TO
FIND OUT WHO WERE HIS CORRESPONDENTS
I FEAR I CANNOT HELP YOU MUCH HIS ONLY CORRESPONDENT SO FAR AS I
KNOW WAS HIS OWN FATHER
WHO WROTE TO HIM ON THE VERY DAY OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE WERE THE
RELATIONS BETWEEN FATHER AND SON VERY FRIENDLY
HIS GRACE IS NEVER VERY FRIENDLY WITH ANYONE HE IS COMPLETELY
IMMERSED IN LARGE PUBLIC QUESTIONS AND IS RATHER INACCESSIBLE TO ALL
ORDINARY EMOTIONS BUT HE WAS ALWAYS KIND TO THE BOY IN HIS OWN WAY
BUT THE SYMPATHIES OF THE LATTER WERE WITH THE MOTHER
YES
DID HE SAY SO
NO
THE DUKE THEN
GOOD HEAVENS NO
THEN HOW COULD YOU KNOW
I HAVE HAD SOME CONFIDENTIAL TALKS WITH MR JAMES WILDER HIS
GRACES SECRETARY IT WAS HE WHO GAVE ME THE INFORMATION ABOUT LORD
SALTIRES FEELINGS
I SEE BY THE WAY THAT LAST LETTER OF THE DUKESWAS IT FOUND IN
THE BOYS ROOM AFTER HE WAS GONE
NO HE HAD TAKEN IT WITH HIM I THINK MR HOLMES IT IS TIME THAT
WE WERE LEAVING FOR EUSTON
I WILL ORDER A FOURWHEELER IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WE SHALL BE AT
YOUR SERVICE IF YOU ARE TELEGRAPHING HOME MR HUXTABLE IT WOULD BE
WELL TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE IN YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD TO IMAGINE THAT THE
INQUIRY IS STILL GOING ON IN LIVERPOOL OR WHEREVER ELSE THAT RED
HERRING LED YOUR PACK IN THE MEANTIME I WILL DO A LITTLE QUIET WORK
AT YOUR OWN DOORS AND PERHAPS THE SCENT IS NOT SO COLD BUT THAT TWO
OLD HOUNDS LIKE WATSON AND MYSELF MAY GET A SNIFF OF IT
THAT EVENING FOUND US IN THE COLD BRACING ATMOSPHERE OF THE PEAK
COUNTRY IN WHICH DR HUXTABLES FAMOUS SCHOOL IS SITUATED IT WAS
ALREADY DARK WHEN WE REACHED IT A CARD WAS LYING ON THE HALL TABLE
AND THE BUTLER WHISPERED SOMETHING TO HIS MASTER WHO TURNED TO US
WITH AGITATION IN EVERY HEAVY FEATURE
THE DUKE IS HERE SAID HE THE DUKE AND MR WILDER ARE IN THE
STUDY COME GENTLEMEN AND I WILL INTRODUCE YOU
I WAS OF COURSE FAMILIAR WITH THE PICTURES OF THE FAMOUS STATESMAN
BUT THE MAN HIMSELF WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM HIS REPRESENTATION HE
WAS A TALL AND STATELY PERSON SCRUPULOUSLY DRESSED WITH A DRAWN
THIN FACE AND A NOSE WHICH WAS GROTESQUELY CURVED AND LONG HIS
COMPLEXION WAS OF A DEAD PALLOR WHICH WAS MORE STARTLING BY CONTRAST
WITH A LONG DWINDLING BEARD OF VIVID RED WHICH FLOWED DOWN OVER HIS
WHITE WAISTCOAT WITH HIS WATCHCHAIN GLEAMING THROUGH ITS FRINGE
SUCH WAS THE STATELY PRESENCE WHO LOOKED STONILY AT US FROM THE
CENTRE OF DR HUXTABLES HEARTHRUG BESIDE HIM STOOD A VERY YOUNG
MAN WHOM I UNDERSTOOD TO BE WILDER THE PRIVATE SECRETARY HE WAS
SMALL NERVOUS ALERT WITH INTELLIGENT LIGHTBLUE EYES AND MOBILE
FEATURES IT WAS HE WHO AT ONCE IN AN INCISIVE AND POSITIVE TONE
OPENED THE CONVERSATION
I CALLED THIS MORNING DR HUXTABLE TOO LATE TO PREVENT YOU FROM
STARTING FOR LONDON I LEARNED THAT YOUR OBJECT WAS TO INVITE MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES TO UNDERTAKE THE CONDUCT OF THIS CASE HIS GRACE IS
SURPRISED DR HUXTABLE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN SUCH A STEP
WITHOUT CONSULTING HIM
WHEN I LEARNED THAT THE POLICE HAD FAILED
HIS GRACE IS BY NO MEANS CONVINCED THAT THE POLICE HAVE FAILED
BUT SURELY MR WILDER
YOU ARE WELL AWARE DR HUXTABLE THAT HIS GRACE IS PARTICULARLY
ANXIOUS TO AVOID ALL PUBLIC SCANDAL HE PREFERS TO TAKE AS FEW PEOPLE
AS POSSIBLE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE
THE MATTER CAN BE EASILY REMEDIED SAID THE BROWBEATEN DOCTOR
MR SHERLOCK HOLMES CAN RETURN TO LONDON BY THE MORNING TRAIN
HARDLY THAT DOCTOR HARDLY THAT SAID HOLMES IN HIS BLANDEST
VOICE THIS NORTHERN AIR IS INVIGORATING AND PLEASANT SO I PROPOSE
TO SPEND A FEW DAYS UPON YOUR MOORS AND TO OCCUPY MY MIND AS BEST I
MAY WHETHER I HAVE THE SHELTER OF YOUR ROOF OR OF THE VILLAGE INN
IS OF COURSE FOR YOU TO DECIDE
I COULD SEE THAT THE UNFORTUNATE DOCTOR WAS IN THE LAST STAGE OF
INDECISION FROM WHICH HE WAS RESCUED BY THE DEEP SONOROUS VOICE OF
THE REDBEARDED DUKE WHICH BOOMED OUT LIKE A DINNERGONG
I AGREE WITH MR WILDER DR HUXTABLE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE
WISELY TO CONSULT ME BUT SINCE MR HOLMES HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN
INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE IT WOULD INDEED BE ABSURD THAT WE SHOULD NOT
AVAIL OURSELVES OF HIS SERVICES FAR FROM GOING TO THE INN MR
HOLMES I SHOULD BE PLEASED IF YOU WOULD COME AND STAY WITH ME AT
HOLDERNESSE HALL
I THANK YOUR GRACE FOR THE PURPOSES OF MY INVESTIGATION I THINK
THAT IT WOULD BE WISER FOR ME TO REMAIN AT THE SCENE OF THE MYSTERY
JUST AS YOU LIKE MR HOLMES ANY INFORMATION WHICH MR WILDER OR I
CAN GIVE YOU IS OF COURSE AT YOUR DISPOSAL
IT WILL PROBABLY BE NECESSARY FOR ME TO SEE YOU AT THE HALL SAID
HOLMES I WOULD ONLY ASK YOU NOW SIR WHETHER YOU HAVE FORMED ANY
EXPLANATION IN YOUR OWN MIND AS TO THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF
YOUR SON
NO SIR I HAVE NOT
EXCUSE ME IF I ALLUDE TO THAT WHICH IS PAINFUL TO YOU BUT I HAVE NO
ALTERNATIVE DO YOU THINK THAT THE DUCHESS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THE MATTER
THE GREAT MINISTER SHOWED PERCEPTIBLE HESITATION
I DO NOT THINK SO HE SAID AT LAST
THE OTHER MOST OBVIOUS EXPLANATION IS THAT THE CHILD HAS BEEN
KIDNAPPED FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEVYING RANSOM YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY
DEMAND OF THE SORT
NO SIR
ONE MORE QUESTION YOUR GRACE I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WROTE TO YOUR
SON UPON THE DAY WHEN THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED
NO I WROTE UPON THE DAY BEFORE
EXACTLY BUT HE RECEIVED IT ON THAT DAY
YES
WAS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR LETTER WHICH MIGHT HAVE UNBALANCED HIM OR
INDUCED HIM TO TAKE SUCH A STEP
NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT
DID YOU POST THAT LETTER YOURSELF
THE NOBLEMANS REPLY WAS INTERRUPTED BY HIS SECRETARY WHO BROKE IN
WITH SOME HEAT
HIS GRACE IS NOT IN THE HABIT OF POSTING LETTERS HIMSELF SAID HE
THIS LETTER WAS LAID WITH OTHERS UPON THE STUDY TABLE AND I MYSELF
PUT THEM IN THE POSTBAG
YOU ARE SURE THIS ONE WAS AMONG THEM
YES I OBSERVED IT
HOW MANY LETTERS DID YOUR GRACE WRITE THAT DAY
TWENTY OR THIRTY I HAVE A LARGE CORRESPONDENCE BUT SURELY THIS IS
SOMEWHAT IRRELEVANT
NOT ENTIRELY SAID HOLMES
FOR MY OWN PART THE DUKE CONTINUED I HAVE ADVISED THE POLICE TO
TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO THE SOUTH OF FRANCE I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE DUCHESS WOULD ENCOURAGE SO MONSTROUS AN
ACTION BUT THE LAD HAD THE MOST WRONGHEADED OPINIONS AND IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT HE MAY HAVE FLED TO HER AIDED AND ABETTED BY THIS
GERMAN I THINK DR HUXTABLE THAT WE WILL NOW RETURN TO THE HALL
I COULD SEE THAT THERE WERE OTHER QUESTIONS WHICH HOLMES WOULD HAVE
WISHED TO PUT BUT THE NOBLEMANS ABRUPT MANNER SHOWED THAT THE
INTERVIEW WAS AT AN END IT WAS EVIDENT THAT TO HIS INTENSELY
ARISTOCRATIC NATURE THIS DISCUSSION OF HIS INTIMATE FAMILY AFFAIRS
WITH A STRANGER WAS MOST ABHORRENT AND THAT HE FEARED LEST EVERY
FRESH QUESTION WOULD THROW A FIERCER LIGHT INTO THE DISCREETLY
SHADOWED CORNERS OF HIS DUCAL HISTORY
WHEN THE NOBLEMAN AND HIS SECRETARY HAD LEFT MY FRIEND FLUNG HIMSELF
AT ONCE WITH CHARACTERISTIC EAGERNESS INTO THE INVESTIGATION
THE BOYS CHAMBER WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINED AND YIELDED NOTHING SAVE
THE ABSOLUTE CONVICTION THAT IT WAS ONLY THROUGH THE WINDOW THAT HE
COULD HAVE ESCAPED THE GERMAN MASTERS ROOM AND EFFECTS GAVE NO
FURTHER CLUE IN HIS CASE A TRAILER OF IVY HAD GIVEN WAY UNDER HIS
WEIGHT AND WE SAW BY THE LIGHT OF A LANTERN THE MARK ON THE LAWN
WHERE HIS HEELS HAD COME DOWN THAT ONE DINT IN THE SHORT GREEN GRASS
WAS THE ONLY MATERIAL WITNESS LEFT OF THIS INEXPLICABLE NOCTURNAL
FLIGHT
SHERLOCK HOLMES LEFT THE HOUSE ALONE AND ONLY RETURNED AFTER ELEVEN
HE HAD OBTAINED A LARGE ORDNANCE MAP OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND THIS
HE BROUGHT INTO MY ROOM WHERE HE LAID IT OUT ON THE BED AND HAVING
BALANCED THE LAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT HE BEGAN TO SMOKE OVER IT AND
OCCASIONALLY TO POINT OUT OBJECTS OF INTEREST WITH THE REEKING AMBER
OF HIS PIPE
THIS CASE GROWS UPON ME WATSON SAID HE THERE ARE DECIDEDLY SOME
POINTS OF INTEREST IN CONNECTION WITH IT IN THIS EARLY STAGE I WANT
YOU TO REALIZE THOSE GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES WHICH MAY HAVE A GOOD DEAL
TO DO WITH OUR INVESTIGATION
LOOK AT THIS MAP THIS DARK SQUARE IS THE PRIORY SCHOOL ILL PUT A
PIN IN IT NOW THIS LINE IS THE MAIN ROAD YOU SEE THAT IT RUNS EAST
AND WEST PAST THE SCHOOL AND YOU SEE ALSO THAT THERE IS NO SIDE ROAD
FOR A MILE EITHER WAY IF THESE TWO FOLK PASSED AWAY BY ROAD IT WAS
THIS ROAD
PICTURE CHART OF THE SURROUNDING AREA EXACTLY
BY A SINGULAR AND HAPPY CHANCE WE ARE ABLE TO SOME EXTENT TO CHECK
WHAT PASSED ALONG THIS ROAD DURING THE NIGHT IN QUESTION AT THIS
POINT WHERE MY PIPE IS NOW RESTING A COUNTRY CONSTABLE WAS ON DUTY
FROM TWELVE TO SIX IT IS AS YOU PERCEIVE THE FIRST CROSS ROAD ON
THE EAST SIDE THIS MAN DECLARES THAT HE WAS NOT ABSENT FROM HIS POST
FOR AN INSTANT AND HE IS POSITIVE THAT NEITHER BOY NOR MAN COULD
HAVE GONE THAT WAY UNSEEN I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THIS POLICEMAN
TONIGHT AND HE APPEARS TO ME TO BE A PERFECTLY RELIABLE PERSON
THAT BLOCKS THIS END WE HAVE NOW TO DEAL WITH THE OTHER THERE IS AN
INN HERE THE RED BULL THE LANDLADY OF WHICH WAS ILL SHE HAD SENT
TO MACKLETON FOR A DOCTOR BUT HE DID NOT ARRIVE UNTIL MORNING BEING
ABSENT AT ANOTHER CASE THE PEOPLE AT THE INN WERE ALERT ALL NIGHT
AWAITING HIS COMING AND ONE OR OTHER OF THEM SEEMS TO HAVE
CONTINUALLY HAD AN EYE UPON THE ROAD THEY DECLARE THAT NO ONE
PASSED IF THEIR EVIDENCE IS GOOD THEN WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE
ABLE TO BLOCK THE WEST AND ALSO TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THE FUGITIVES
DID NOT USE THE ROAD AT ALL
BUT THE BICYCLE I OBJECTED
QUITE SO WE WILL COME TO THE BICYCLE PRESENTLY TO CONTINUE OUR
REASONING IF THESE PEOPLE DID NOT GO BY THE ROAD THEY MUST HAVE
TRAVERSED THE COUNTRY TO THE NORTH OF THE HOUSE OR TO THE SOUTH OF
THE HOUSE THAT IS CERTAIN LET US WEIGH THE ONE AGAINST THE OTHER
ON THE SOUTH OF THE HOUSE IS AS YOU PERCEIVE A LARGE DISTRICT OF
ARABLE LAND CUT UP INTO SMALL FIELDS WITH STONE WALLS BETWEEN THEM
THERE I ADMIT THAT A BICYCLE IS IMPOSSIBLE WE CAN DISMISS THE IDEA
WE TURN TO THE COUNTRY ON THE NORTH HERE THERE LIES A GROVE OF
TREES MARKED AS THE RAGGED SHAW AND ON THE FARTHER SIDE STRETCHES
A GREAT ROLLING MOOR LOWER GILL MOOR EXTENDING FOR TEN MILES AND
SLOPING GRADUALLY UPWARDS HERE AT ONE SIDE OF THIS WILDERNESS IS
HOLDERNESSE HALL TEN MILES BY ROAD BUT ONLY SIX ACROSS THE MOOR IT
IS A PECULIARLY DESOLATE PLAIN A FEW MOOR FARMERS HAVE SMALL
HOLDINGS WHERE THEY REAR SHEEP AND CATTLE EXCEPT THESE THE PLOVER
AND THE CURLEW ARE THE ONLY INHABITANTS UNTIL YOU COME TO THE
CHESTERFIELD HIGH ROAD THERE IS A CHURCH THERE YOU SEE A FEW
COTTAGES AND AN INN BEYOND THAT THE HILLS BECOME PRECIPITOUS
SURELY IT IS HERE TO THE NORTH THAT OUR QUEST MUST LIE
BUT THE BICYCLE I PERSISTED
WELL WELL SAID HOLMES IMPATIENTLY A GOOD CYCLIST DOES NOT NEED
A HIGH ROAD THE MOOR IS INTERSECTED WITH PATHS AND THE MOON WAS AT
THE FULL HALLOA WHAT IS THIS
THERE WAS AN AGITATED KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND AN INSTANT AFTERWARDS
DR HUXTABLE WAS IN THE ROOM IN HIS HAND HE HELD A BLUE CRICKETCAP
WITH A WHITE CHEVRON ON THE PEAK
AT LAST WE HAVE A CLUE HE CRIED THANK HEAVEN AT LAST WE ARE ON
THE DEAR BOYS TRACK IT IS HIS CAP
WHERE WAS IT FOUND
IN THE VAN OF THE GIPSIES WHO CAMPED ON THE MOOR THEY LEFT ON
TUESDAY TODAY THE POLICE TRACED THEM DOWN AND EXAMINED THEIR
CARAVAN THIS WAS FOUND
HOW DO THEY ACCOUNT FOR IT
THEY SHUFFLED AND LIEDSAID THAT THEY FOUND IT ON THE MOOR ON
TUESDAY MORNING THEY KNOW WHERE HE IS THE RASCALS THANK GOODNESS
THEY ARE ALL SAFE UNDER LOCK AND KEY EITHER THE FEAR OF THE LAW OR
THE DUKES PURSE WILL CERTAINLY GET OUT OF THEM ALL THAT THEY KNOW
SO FAR SO GOOD SAID HOLMES WHEN THE DOCTOR HAD AT LAST LEFT THE
ROOM IT AT LEAST BEARS OUT THE THEORY THAT IT IS ON THE SIDE OF THE
LOWER GILL MOOR THAT WE MUST HOPE FOR RESULTS THE POLICE HAVE REALLY
DONE NOTHING LOCALLY SAVE THE ARREST OF THESE GIPSIES LOOK HERE
WATSON THERE IS A WATERCOURSE ACROSS THE MOOR YOU SEE IT MARKED
HERE IN THE MAP IN SOME PARTS IT WIDENS INTO A MORASS THIS IS
PARTICULARLY SO IN THE REGION BETWEEN HOLDERNESSE HALL AND THE
SCHOOL IT IS VAIN TO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR TRACKS IN THIS DRY WEATHER
BUT AT THAT POINT THERE IS CERTAINLY A CHANCE OF SOME RECORD BEING
LEFT I WILL CALL YOU EARLY TOMORROW MORNING AND YOU AND I WILL TRY
IF WE CAN THROW SOME LITTLE LIGHT UPON THE MYSTERY
THE DAY WAS JUST BREAKING WHEN I WOKE TO FIND THE LONG THIN FORM OF
HOLMES BY MY BEDSIDE HE WAS FULLY DRESSED AND HAD APPARENTLY
ALREADY BEEN OUT
I HAVE DONE THE LAWN AND THE BICYCLE SHED SAID HE I HAVE ALSO
HAD A RAMBLE THROUGH THE RAGGED SHAW NOW WATSON THERE IS COCOA
READY IN THE NEXT ROOM I MUST BEG YOU TO HURRY FOR WE HAVE A GREAT
DAY BEFORE US
HIS EYES SHONE AND HIS CHEEK WAS FLUSHED WITH THE EXHILARATION OF
THE MASTER WORKMAN WHO SEES HIS WORK LIE READY BEFORE HIM A VERY
DIFFERENT HOLMES THIS ACTIVE ALERT MAN FROM THE INTROSPECTIVE AND
PALLID DREAMER OF BAKER STREET I FELT AS I LOOKED UPON THAT SUPPLE
FIGURE ALIVE WITH NERVOUS ENERGY THAT IT WAS INDEED A STRENUOUS DAY
THAT AWAITED US
AND YET IT OPENED IN THE BLACKEST DISAPPOINTMENT WITH HIGH HOPES WE
STRUCK ACROSS THE PEATY RUSSET MOOR INTERSECTED WITH A THOUSAND
SHEEP PATHS UNTIL WE CAME TO THE BROAD LIGHTGREEN BELT WHICH
MARKED THE MORASS BETWEEN US AND HOLDERNESSE CERTAINLY IF THE LAD
HAD GONE HOMEWARDS HE MUST HAVE PASSED THIS AND HE COULD NOT PASS
IT WITHOUT LEAVING HIS TRACES BUT NO SIGN OF HIM OR THE GERMAN COULD
BE SEEN WITH A DARKENING FACE MY FRIEND STRODE ALONG THE MARGIN
EAGERLY OBSERVANT OF EVERY MUDDY STAIN UPON THE MOSSY SURFACE
SHEEPMARKS THERE WERE IN PROFUSION AND AT ONE PLACE SOME MILES
DOWN COWS HAD LEFT THEIR TRACKS NOTHING MORE
CHECK NUMBER ONE SAID HOLMES LOOKING GLOOMILY OVER THE ROLLING
EXPANSE OF THE MOOR THERE IS ANOTHER MORASS DOWN YONDER AND A
NARROW NECK BETWEEN HALLOA HALLOA HALLOA WHAT HAVE WE HERE
WE HAD COME ON A SMALL BLACK RIBBON OF PATHWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
CLEARLY MARKED ON THE SODDEN SOIL WAS THE TRACK OF A BICYCLE
HURRAH I CRIED WE HAVE IT
BUT HOLMES WAS SHAKING HIS HEAD AND HIS FACE WAS PUZZLED AND
EXPECTANT RATHER THAN JOYOUS
A BICYCLE CERTAINLY BUT NOT THE BICYCLE SAID HE I AM FAMILIAR
WITH FORTYTWO DIFFERENT IMPRESSIONS LEFT BY TYRES THIS AS YOU
PERCEIVE IS A DUNLOP WITH A PATCH UPON THE OUTER COVER HEIDEGGERS
TYRES WERE PALMERS LEAVING LONGITUDINAL STRIPES AVELING THE
MATHEMATICAL MASTER WAS SURE UPON THE POINT THEREFORE IT IS NOT
HEIDEGGERS TRACK
THE BOYS THEN
POSSIBLY IF WE COULD PROVE A BICYCLE TO HAVE BEEN IN HIS
POSSESSION BUT THIS WE HAVE UTTERLY FAILED TO DO THIS TRACK AS YOU
PERCEIVE WAS MADE BY A RIDER WHO WAS GOING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE
SCHOOL
OR TOWARDS IT
NO NO MY DEAR WATSON THE MORE DEEPLY SUNK IMPRESSION IS OF
COURSE THE HIND WHEEL UPON WHICH THE WEIGHT RESTS YOU PERCEIVE
SEVERAL PLACES WHERE IT HAS PASSED ACROSS AND OBLITERATED THE MORE
SHALLOW MARK OF THE FRONT ONE IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY HEADING AWAY FROM
THE SCHOOL IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE CONNECTED WITH OUR INQUIRY BUT WE
WILL FOLLOW IT BACKWARDS BEFORE WE GO ANY FARTHER
WE DID SO AND AT THE END OF A FEW HUNDRED YARDS LOST THE TRACKS AS
WE EMERGED FROM THE BOGGY PORTION OF THE MOOR FOLLOWING THE PATH
BACKWARDS WE PICKED OUT ANOTHER SPOT WHERE A SPRING TRICKLED ACROSS
IT HERE ONCE AGAIN WAS THE MARK OF THE BICYCLE THOUGH NEARLY
OBLITERATED BY THE HOOFS OF COWS AFTER THAT THERE WAS NO SIGN BUT
THE PATH RAN RIGHT ON INTO RAGGED SHAW THE WOOD WHICH BACKED ON TO
THE SCHOOL FROM THIS WOOD THE CYCLE MUST HAVE EMERGED HOLMES SAT
DOWN ON A BOULDER AND RESTED HIS CHIN IN HIS HANDS I HAD SMOKED TWO
CIGARETTES BEFORE HE MOVED
WELL WELL SAID HE AT LAST IT IS OF COURSE POSSIBLE THAT A
CUNNING MAN MIGHT CHANGE THE TYRE OF HIS BICYCLE IN ORDER TO LEAVE
UNFAMILIAR TRACKS A CRIMINAL WHO WAS CAPABLE OF SUCH A THOUGHT IS A
MAN WHOM I SHOULD BE PROUD TO DO BUSINESS WITH WE WILL LEAVE THIS
QUESTION UNDECIDED AND HARK BACK TO OUR MORASS AGAIN FOR WE HAVE
LEFT A GOOD DEAL UNEXPLORED
WE CONTINUED OUR SYSTEMATIC SURVEY OF THE EDGE OF THE SODDEN PORTION
OF THE MOOR AND SOON OUR PERSEVERANCE WAS GLORIOUSLY REWARDED RIGHT
ACROSS THE LOWER PART OF THE BOG LAY A MIRY PATH HOLMES GAVE A CRY
OF DELIGHT AS HE APPROACHED IT AN IMPRESSION LIKE A FINE BUNDLE OF
TELEGRAPH WIRES RAN DOWN THE CENTRE OF IT IT WAS THE PALMER TYRE
HERE IS HERR HEIDEGGER SURE ENOUGH CRIED HOLMES EXULTANTLY MY
REASONING SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PRETTY SOUND WATSON
I CONGRATULATE YOU
BUT WE HAVE A LONG WAY STILL TO GO KINDLY WALK CLEAR OF THE PATH
NOW LET US FOLLOW THE TRAIL I FEAR THAT IT WILL NOT LEAD VERY FAR
WE FOUND HOWEVER AS WE ADVANCED THAT THIS PORTION OF THE MOOR IS
INTERSECTED WITH SOFT PATCHES AND THOUGH WE FREQUENTLY LOST SIGHT
OF THE TRACK WE ALWAYS SUCCEEDED IN PICKING IT UP ONCE MORE
DO YOU OBSERVE SAID HOLMES THAT THE RIDER IS NOW UNDOUBTEDLY
FORCING THE PACE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF IT LOOK AT THIS
IMPRESSION WHERE YOU GET BOTH TYRES CLEAR THE ONE IS AS DEEP AS THE
OTHER THAT CAN ONLY MEAN THAT THE RIDER IS THROWING HIS WEIGHT ON TO
THE HANDLEBAR AS A MAN DOES WHEN HE IS SPRINTING BY JOVE HE HAS
HAD A FALL
THERE WAS A BROAD IRREGULAR SMUDGE COVERING SOME YARDS OF THE TRACK
THEN THERE WERE A FEW FOOTMARKS AND THE TYRE REAPPEARED ONCE MORE
A SIDESLIP I SUGGESTED
HOLMES HELD UP A CRUMPLED BRANCH OF FLOWERING GORSE TO MY HORROR I
PERCEIVED THAT THE YELLOW BLOSSOMS WERE ALL DABBLED WITH CRIMSON ON
THE PATH TOO AND AMONG THE HEATHER WERE DARK STAINS OF CLOTTED
BLOOD
BAD SAID HOLMES BAD STAND CLEAR WATSON NOT AN UNNECESSARY
FOOTSTEP WHAT DO I READ HERE HE FELL WOUNDED HE STOOD UP HE
REMOUNTED HE PROCEEDED BUT THERE IS NO OTHER TRACK CATTLE ON THIS
SIDE PATH HE WAS SURELY NOT GORED BY A BULL IMPOSSIBLE BUT I SEE
NO TRACES OF ANYONE ELSE WE MUST PUSH ON WATSON SURELY WITH STAINS
AS WELL AS THE TRACK TO GUIDE US HE CANNOT ESCAPE US NOW
OUR SEARCH WAS NOT A VERY LONG ONE THE TRACKS OF THE TYRE BEGAN TO
CURVE FANTASTICALLY UPON THE WET AND SHINING PATH SUDDENLY AS I
LOOKED AHEAD THE GLEAM OF METAL CAUGHT MY EYE FROM AMID THE THICK
GORSE BUSHES OUT OF THEM WE DRAGGED A BICYCLE PALMERTYRED ONE
PEDAL BENT AND THE WHOLE FRONT OF IT HORRIBLY SMEARED AND SLOBBERED
WITH BLOOD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUSHES A SHOE WAS PROJECTING WE
RAN ROUND AND THERE LAY THE UNFORTUNATE RIDER HE WAS A TALL MAN
FULL BEARDED WITH SPECTACLES ONE GLASS OF WHICH HAD BEEN KNOCKED
OUT THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH WAS A FRIGHTFUL BLOW UPON THE HEAD WHICH
HAD CRUSHED IN PART OF HIS SKULL THAT HE COULD HAVE GONE ON AFTER
RECEIVING SUCH AN INJURY SAID MUCH FOR THE VITALITY AND COURAGE OF
THE MAN HE WORE SHOES BUT NO SOCKS AND HIS OPEN COAT DISCLOSED A
NIGHTSHIRT BENEATH IT IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE GERMAN MASTER
HOLMES TURNED THE BODY OVER REVERENTLY AND EXAMINED IT WITH GREAT
ATTENTION HE THEN SAT IN DEEP THOUGHT FOR A TIME AND I COULD SEE BY
HIS RUFFLED BROW THAT THIS GRIM DISCOVERY HAD NOT IN HIS OPINION
ADVANCED US MUCH IN OUR INQUIRY
IT IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WATSON SAID HE AT
LAST MY OWN INCLINATIONS ARE TO PUSH THIS INQUIRY ON FOR WE HAVE
ALREADY LOST SO MUCH TIME THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO WASTE ANOTHER
HOUR ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE BOUND TO INFORM THE POLICE OF THE
DISCOVERY AND TO SEE THAT THIS POOR FELLOWS BODY IS LOOKED AFTER
I COULD TAKE A NOTE BACK
BUT I NEED YOUR COMPANY AND ASSISTANCE WAIT A BIT THERE IS A
FELLOW CUTTING PEAT UP YONDER BRING HIM OVER HERE AND HE WILL GUIDE
THE POLICE
I BROUGHT THE PEASANT ACROSS AND HOLMES DISPATCHED THE FRIGHTENED
MAN WITH A NOTE TO DR HUXTABLE
NOW WATSON SAID HE WE HAVE PICKED UP TWO CLUES THIS MORNING
ONE IS THE BICYCLE WITH THE PALMER TYRE AND WE SEE WHAT THAT HAS LED
TO THE OTHER IS THE BICYCLE WITH THE PATCHED DUNLOP BEFORE WE START
TO INVESTIGATE THAT LET US TRY TO REALIZE WHAT WE DO KNOW SO AS TO
MAKE THE MOST OF IT AND TO SEPARATE THE ESSENTIAL FROM THE
ACCIDENTAL
FIRST OF ALL I WISH TO IMPRESS UPON YOU THAT THE BOY CERTAINLY LEFT
OF HIS OWN FREE WILL HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS WINDOW AND HE WENT OFF
EITHER ALONE OR WITH SOMEONE THAT IS SURE
I ASSENTED
WELL NOW LET US TURN TO THIS UNFORTUNATE GERMAN MASTER THE BOY
WAS FULLY DRESSED WHEN HE FLED THEREFORE HE FORESAW WHAT HE WOULD
DO BUT THE GERMAN WENT WITHOUT HIS SOCKS HE CERTAINLY ACTED ON VERY
SHORT NOTICE
UNDOUBTEDLY
WHY DID HE GO BECAUSE FROM HIS BEDROOM WINDOW HE SAW THE FLIGHT
OF THE BOY BECAUSE HE WISHED TO OVERTAKE HIM AND BRING HIM BACK HE
SEIZED HIS BICYCLE PURSUED THE LAD AND IN PURSUING HIM MET HIS
DEATH
SO IT WOULD SEEM
NOW I COME TO THE CRITICAL PART OF MY ARGUMENT THE NATURAL ACTION
OF A MAN IN PURSUING A LITTLE BOY WOULD BE TO RUN AFTER HIM HE WOULD
KNOW THAT HE COULD OVERTAKE HIM BUT THE GERMAN DOES NOT DO SO HE
TURNS TO HIS BICYCLE I AM TOLD THAT HE WAS AN EXCELLENT CYCLIST HE
WOULD NOT DO THIS IF HE DID NOT SEE THAT THE BOY HAD SOME SWIFT MEANS
OF ESCAPE
THE OTHER BICYCLE
LET US CONTINUE OUR RECONSTRUCTION HE MEETS HIS DEATH FIVE MILES
FROM THE SCHOOLNOT BY A BULLET MARK YOU WHICH EVEN A LAD MIGHT
CONCEIVABLY DISCHARGE BUT BY A SAVAGE BLOW DEALT BY A VIGOROUS ARM
THE LAD THEN HAD A COMPANION IN HIS FLIGHT AND THE FLIGHT WAS A
SWIFT ONE SINCE IT TOOK FIVE MILES BEFORE AN EXPERT CYCLIST COULD
OVERTAKE THEM YET WE SURVEY THE GROUND ROUND THE SCENE OF THE
TRAGEDY WHAT DO WE FIND A FEW CATTLE TRACKS NOTHING MORE I TOOK A
WIDE SWEEP ROUND AND THERE IS NO PATH WITHIN FIFTY YARDS ANOTHER
CYCLIST COULD HAVE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL MURDER NOR WERE
THERE ANY HUMAN FOOTMARKS
HOLMES I CRIED THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE
ADMIRABLE HE SAID A MOST ILLUMINATING REMARK IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
AS I STATE IT AND THEREFORE I MUST IN SOME RESPECT HAVE STATED IT
WRONG YET YOU SAW FOR YOURSELF CAN YOU SUGGEST ANY FALLACY
HE COULD NOT HAVE FRACTURED HIS SKULL IN A FALL
IN A MORASS WATSON
I AM AT MY WITS END
TUT TUT WE HAVE SOLVED SOME WORSE PROBLEMS AT LEAST WE HAVE
PLENTY OF MATERIAL IF WE CAN ONLY USE IT COME THEN AND HAVING
EXHAUSTED THE PALMER LET US SEE WHAT THE DUNLOP WITH THE PATCHED
COVER HAS TO OFFER US
WE PICKED UP THE TRACK AND FOLLOWED IT ONWARDS FOR SOME DISTANCE BUT
SOON THE MOOR ROSE INTO A LONG HEATHERTUFTED CURVE AND WE LEFT THE
WATERCOURSE BEHIND US NO FURTHER HELP FROM TRACKS COULD BE HOPED
FOR AT THE SPOT WHERE WE SAW THE LAST OF THE DUNLOP TYRE IT MIGHT
EQUALLY HAVE LED TO HOLDERNESSE HALL THE STATELY TOWERS OF WHICH
ROSE SOME MILES TO OUR LEFT OR TO A LOW GREY VILLAGE WHICH LAY IN
FRONT OF US AND MARKED THE POSITION OF THE CHESTERFIELD HIGH ROAD
AS WE APPROACHED THE FORBIDDING AND SQUALID INN WITH THE SIGN OF A
GAMECOCK ABOVE THE DOOR HOLMES GAVE A SUDDEN GROAN AND CLUTCHED ME
BY THE SHOULDER TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM FALLING HE HAD HAD ONE OF THOSE
VIOLENT STRAINS OF THE ANKLE WHICH LEAVE A MAN HELPLESS WITH
DIFFICULTY HE LIMPED UP TO THE DOOR WHERE A SQUAT DARK ELDERLY MAN
WAS SMOKING A BLACK CLAY PIPE
HOW ARE YOU MR REUBEN HAYES SAID HOLMES
WHO ARE YOU AND HOW DO YOU GET MY NAME SO PAT THE COUNTRYMAN
ANSWERED WITH A SUSPICIOUS FLASH OF A PAIR OF CUNNING EYES
WELL ITS PRINTED ON THE BOARD ABOVE YOUR HEAD ITS EASY TO SEE A
MAN WHO IS MASTER OF HIS OWN HOUSE I SUPPOSE YOU HAVENT SUCH A
THING AS A CARRIAGE IN YOUR STABLES
NO I HAVE NOT
I CAN HARDLY PUT MY FOOT TO THE GROUND
DONT PUT IT TO THE GROUND
BUT I CANT WALK
WELL THEN HOP
MR REUBEN HAYESS MANNER WAS FAR FROM GRACIOUS BUT HOLMES TOOK IT
WITH ADMIRABLE GOODHUMOUR
LOOK HERE MY MAN SAID HE THIS IS REALLY RATHER AN AWKWARD FIX
FOR ME I DONT MIND HOW I GET ON
NEITHER DO I SAID THE MOROSE LANDLORD
THE MATTER IS VERY IMPORTANT I WOULD OFFER YOU A SOVEREIGN FOR THE
USE OF A BICYCLE
THE LANDLORD PRICKED UP HIS EARS
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO HOLDERNESSE HALL
PALS OF THE DOOK I SUPPOSE SAID THE LANDLORD SURVEYING OUR
MUDSTAINED GARMENTS WITH IRONICAL EYES
HOLMES LAUGHED GOODNATUREDLY
HELL BE GLAD TO SEE US ANYHOW
WHY
BECAUSE WE BRING HIM NEWS OF HIS LOST SON
THE LANDLORD GAVE A VERY VISIBLE START
WHAT YOURE ON HIS TRACK
HE HAS BEEN HEARD OF IN LIVERPOOL THEY EXPECT TO GET HIM EVERY
HOUR
AGAIN A SWIFT CHANGE PASSED OVER THE HEAVY UNSHAVEN FACE HIS MANNER
WAS SUDDENLY GENIAL
IVE LESS REASON TO WISH THE DOOK WELL THAN MOST MEN SAID HE FOR
I WAS HIS HEAD COACHMAN ONCE AND CRUEL BAD HE TREATED ME IT WAS HIM
THAT SACKED ME WITHOUT A CHARACTER ON THE WORD OF A LYING
CORNCHANDLER BUT IM GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE YOUNG LORD WAS HEARD OF
IN LIVERPOOL AND ILL HELP YOU TO TAKE THE NEWS TO THE HALL
THANK YOU SAID HOLMES WELL HAVE SOME FOOD FIRST THEN YOU CAN
BRING ROUND THE BICYCLE
I HAVENT GOT A BICYCLE
HOLMES HELD UP A SOVEREIGN
I TELL YOU MAN THAT I HAVENT GOT ONE ILL LET YOU HAVE TWO
HORSES AS FAR AS THE HALL
WELL WELL SAID HOLMES WELL TALK ABOUT IT WHEN WEVE HAD
SOMETHING TO EAT
WHEN WE WERE LEFT ALONE IN THE STONEFLAGGED KITCHEN IT WAS
ASTONISHING HOW RAPIDLY THAT SPRAINED ANKLE RECOVERED IT WAS NEARLY
NIGHTFALL AND WE HAD EATEN NOTHING SINCE EARLY MORNING SO THAT WE
SPENT SOME TIME OVER OUR MEAL HOLMES WAS LOST IN THOUGHT AND ONCE
OR TWICE HE WALKED OVER TO THE WINDOW AND STARED EARNESTLY OUT IT
OPENED ON TO A SQUALID COURTYARD IN THE FAR CORNER WAS A SMITHY
WHERE A GRIMY LAD WAS AT WORK ON THE OTHER SIDE WERE THE STABLES
HOLMES HAD SAT DOWN AGAIN AFTER ONE OF THESE EXCURSIONS WHEN HE
SUDDENLY SPRANG OUT OF HIS CHAIR WITH A LOUD EXCLAMATION
BY HEAVEN WATSON I BELIEVE THAT IVE GOT IT HE CRIED YES YES
IT MUST BE SO WATSON DO YOU REMEMBER SEEING ANY COWTRACKS TODAY
YES SEVERAL
WHERE
WELL EVERYWHERE THEY WERE AT THE MORASS AND AGAIN ON THE PATH
AND AGAIN NEAR WHERE POOR HEIDEGGER MET HIS DEATH
EXACTLY WELL NOW WATSON HOW MANY COWS DID YOU SEE ON THE MOOR
I DONT REMEMBER SEEING ANY
STRANGE WATSON THAT WE SHOULD SEE TRACKS ALL ALONG OUR LINE BUT
NEVER A COW ON THE WHOLE MOOR VERY STRANGE WATSON EH
YES IT IS STRANGE
NOW WATSON MAKE AN EFFORT THROW YOUR MIND BACK CAN YOU SEE THOSE
TRACKS UPON THE PATH
YES I CAN
CAN YOU RECALL THAT THE TRACKS WERE SOMETIMES LIKE THAT WATSONHE
ARRANGED A NUMBER OF BREADCRUMBS IN THIS FASHION AND
SOMETIMES LIKE THIS AND OCCASIONALLY LIKE
THIS CAN YOU REMEMBER THAT
NO I CANNOT
BUT I CAN I COULD SWEAR TO IT HOWEVER WE WILL GO BACK AT OUR
LEISURE AND VERIFY IT WHAT A BLIND BEETLE I HAVE BEEN NOT TO DRAW MY
CONCLUSION
AND WHAT IS YOUR CONCLUSION
ONLY THAT IT IS A REMARKABLE COW WHICH WALKS CANTERS AND GALLOPS
BY GEORGE WATSON IT WAS NO BRAIN OF A COUNTRY PUBLICAN THAT THOUGHT
OUT SUCH A BLIND AS THAT THE COAST SEEMS TO BE CLEAR SAVE FOR THAT
LAD IN THE SMITHY LET US SLIP OUT AND SEE WHAT WE CAN SEE
THERE WERE TWO ROUGHHAIRED UNKEMPT HORSES IN THE TUMBLEDOWN
STABLE HOLMES RAISED THE HIND LEG OF ONE OF THEM AND LAUGHED ALOUD
OLD SHOES BUT NEWLY SHODOLD SHOES BUT NEW NAILS THIS CASE
DESERVES TO BE A CLASSIC LET US GO ACROSS TO THE SMITHY
THE LAD CONTINUED HIS WORK WITHOUT REGARDING US I SAW HOLMESS EYE
DARTING TO RIGHT AND LEFT AMONG THE LITTER OF IRON AND WOOD WHICH WAS
SCATTERED ABOUT THE FLOOR SUDDENLY HOWEVER WE HEARD A STEP BEHIND
US AND THERE WAS THE LANDLORD HIS HEAVY EYEBROWS DRAWN OVER HIS
SAVAGE EYES HIS SWARTHY FEATURES CONVULSED WITH PASSION HE HELD A
SHORT METALHEADED STICK IN HIS HAND AND HE ADVANCED IN SO MENACING
A FASHION THAT I WAS RIGHT GLAD TO FEEL THE REVOLVER IN MY POCKET
YOU INFERNAL SPIES THE MAN CRIED WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE
WHY MR REUBEN HAYES SAID HOLMES COOLLY ONE MIGHT THINK THAT
YOU WERE AFRAID OF OUR FINDING SOMETHING OUT
THE MAN MASTERED HIMSELF WITH A VIOLENT EFFORT AND HIS GRIM MOUTH
LOOSENED INTO A FALSE LAUGH WHICH WAS MORE MENACING THAN HIS FROWN
YOURE WELCOME TO ALL YOU CAN FIND OUT IN MY SMITHY SAID HE BUT
LOOK HERE MISTER I DONT CARE FOR FOLK POKING ABOUT MY PLACE
WITHOUT MY LEAVE SO THE SOONER YOU PAY YOUR SCORE AND GET OUT OF
THIS THE BETTER I SHALL BE PLEASED
ALL RIGHT MR HAYESNO HARM MEANT SAID HOLMES WE HAVE BEEN
HAVING A LOOK AT YOUR HORSES BUT I THINK ILL WALK AFTER ALL ITS
NOT FAR I BELIEVE
NOT MORE THAN TWO MILES TO THE HALL GATES THATS THE ROAD TO THE
LEFT HE WATCHED US WITH SULLEN EYES UNTIL WE HAD LEFT HIS PREMISES
WE DID NOT GO VERY FAR ALONG THE ROAD FOR HOLMES STOPPED THE INSTANT
THAT THE CURVE HID US FROM THE LANDLORDS VIEW
WE WERE WARM AS THE CHILDREN SAY AT THAT INN SAID HE I SEEM TO
GROW COLDER EVERY STEP THAT I TAKE AWAY FROM IT NO NO I CANT
POSSIBLY LEAVE IT
I AM CONVINCED SAID I THAT THIS REUBEN HAYES KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT
A MORE SELFEVIDENT VILLAIN I NEVER SAW
OH HE IMPRESSED YOU IN THAT WAY DID HE THERE ARE THE HORSES
THERE IS THE SMITHY YES IT IS AN INTERESTING PLACE THIS FIGHTING
COCK I THINK WE SHALL HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT IN AN UNOBTRUSIVE
WAY
A LONG SLOPING HILLSIDE DOTTED WITH GREY LIMESTONE BOULDERS
STRETCHED BEHIND US WE HAD TURNED OFF THE ROAD AND WERE MAKING OUR
WAY UP THE HILL WHEN LOOKING IN THE DIRECTION OF HOLDERNESSE HALL
I SAW A CYCLIST COMING SWIFTLY ALONG
GET DOWN WATSON CRIED HOLMES WITH A HEAVY HAND UPON MY SHOULDER
WE HAD HARDLY SUNK FROM VIEW WHEN THE MAN FLEW PAST US ON THE ROAD
AMID A ROLLING CLOUD OF DUST I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A PALE AGITATED
FACEA FACE WITH HORROR IN EVERY LINEAMENT THE MOUTH OPEN THE EYES
STARING WILDLY IN FRONT IT WAS LIKE SOME STRANGE CARICATURE OF THE
DAPPER JAMES WILDER WHOM WE HAD SEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
THE DUKES SECRETARY CRIED HOLMES COME WATSON LET US SEE WHAT
HE DOES
WE SCRAMBLED FROM ROCK TO ROCK UNTIL IN A FEW MOMENTS WE HAD MADE OUR
WAY TO A POINT FROM WHICH WE COULD SEE THE FRONT DOOR OF THE INN
WILDERS BICYCLE WAS LEANING AGAINST THE WALL BESIDE IT NO ONE WAS
MOVING ABOUT THE HOUSE NOR COULD WE CATCH A GLIMPSE OF ANY FACES AT
THE WINDOWS SLOWLY THE TWILIGHT CREPT DOWN AS THE SUN SANK BEHIND
THE HIGH TOWERS OF HOLDERNESSE HALL THEN IN THE GLOOM WE SAW THE TWO
SIDELAMPS OF A TRAP LIGHT UP IN THE STABLE YARD OF THE INN AND
SHORTLY AFTERWARDS HEARD THE RATTLE OF HOOFS AS IT WHEELED OUT INTO
THE ROAD AND TORE OFF AT A FURIOUS PACE IN THE DIRECTION OF
CHESTERFIELD
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT WATSON HOLMES WHISPERED
IT LOOKS LIKE A FLIGHT
A SINGLE MAN IN A DOGCART SO FAR AS I COULD SEE WELL IT
CERTAINLY WAS NOT MR JAMES WILDER FOR THERE HE IS AT THE DOOR
A RED SQUARE OF LIGHT HAD SPRUNG OUT OF THE DARKNESS IN THE MIDDLE
OF IT WAS THE BLACK FIGURE OF THE SECRETARY HIS HEAD ADVANCED
PEERING OUT INTO THE NIGHT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS EXPECTING
SOMEONE THEN AT LAST THERE WERE STEPS IN THE ROAD A SECOND FIGURE
WAS VISIBLE FOR AN INSTANT AGAINST THE LIGHT THE DOOR SHUT AND ALL
WAS BLACK ONCE MORE FIVE MINUTES LATER A LAMP WAS LIT IN A ROOM UPON
THE FIRST FLOOR
IT SEEMS TO BE A CURIOUS CLASS OF CUSTOM THAT IS DONE BY THE
FIGHTING COCK SAID HOLMES
THE BAR IS ON THE OTHER SIDE
QUITE SO THESE ARE WHAT ONE MAY CALL THE PRIVATE GUESTS NOW WHAT
IN THE WORLD IS MR JAMES WILDER DOING IN THAT DEN AT THIS HOUR OF
NIGHT AND WHO IS THE COMPANION WHO COMES TO MEET HIM THERE COME
WATSON WE MUST REALLY TAKE A RISK AND TRY TO INVESTIGATE THIS A
LITTLE MORE CLOSELY
TOGETHER WE STOLE DOWN TO THE ROAD AND CREPT ACROSS TO THE DOOR OF
THE INN THE BICYCLE STILL LEANED AGAINST THE WALL HOLMES STRUCK A
MATCH AND HELD IT TO THE BACK WHEEL AND I HEARD HIM CHUCKLE AS THE
LIGHT FELL UPON A PATCHED DUNLOP TYRE UP ABOVE US WAS THE LIGHTED
WINDOW
I MUST HAVE A PEEP THROUGH THAT WATSON IF YOU BEND YOUR BACK AND
SUPPORT YOURSELF UPON THE WALL I THINK THAT I CAN MANAGE
AN INSTANT LATER HIS FEET WERE ON MY SHOULDERS BUT HE WAS HARDLY UP
BEFORE HE WAS DOWN AGAIN
COME MY FRIEND SAID HE OUR DAYS WORK HAS BEEN QUITE LONG
ENOUGH I THINK THAT WE HAVE GATHERED ALL THAT WE CAN ITS A LONG
WALK TO THE SCHOOL AND THE SOONER WE GET STARTED THE BETTER
HE HARDLY OPENED HIS LIPS DURING THAT WEARY TRUDGE ACROSS THE MOOR
NOR WOULD HE ENTER THE SCHOOL WHEN HE REACHED IT BUT WENT ON TO
MACKLETON STATION WHENCE HE COULD SEND SOME TELEGRAMS LATE AT NIGHT
I HEARD HIM CONSOLING DR HUXTABLE PROSTRATED BY THE TRAGEDY OF HIS
MASTERS DEATH AND LATER STILL HE ENTERED MY ROOM AS ALERT AND
VIGOROUS AS HE HAD BEEN WHEN HE STARTED IN THE MORNING ALL GOES
WELL MY FRIEND SAID HE I PROMISE THAT BEFORE TOMORROW EVENING
WE SHALL HAVE REACHED THE SOLUTION OF THE MYSTERY
AT ELEVEN OCLOCK NEXT MORNING MY FRIEND AND I WERE WALKING UP THE
FAMOUS YEW AVENUE OF HOLDERNESSE HALL WE WERE USHERED THROUGH THE
MAGNIFICENT ELIZABETHAN DOORWAY AND INTO HIS GRACES STUDY THERE WE
FOUND MR JAMES WILDER DEMURE AND COURTLY BUT WITH SOME TRACE OF
THAT WILD TERROR OF THE NIGHT BEFORE STILL LURKING IN HIS FURTIVE
EYES AND IN HIS TWITCHING FEATURES
YOU HAVE COME TO SEE HIS GRACE I AM SORRY BUT THE FACT IS THAT THE
DUKE IS FAR FROM WELL HE HAS BEEN VERY MUCH UPSET BY THE TRAGIC
NEWS WE RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM DR HUXTABLE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON
WHICH TOLD US OF YOUR DISCOVERY
I MUST SEE THE DUKE MR WILDER
BUT HE IS IN HIS ROOM
THEN I MUST GO TO HIS ROOM
I BELIEVE HE IS IN HIS BED
I WILL SEE HIM THERE
HOLMESS COLD AND INEXORABLE MANNER SHOWED THE SECRETARY THAT IT WAS
USELESS TO ARGUE WITH HIM
VERY GOOD MR HOLMES I WILL TELL HIM THAT YOU ARE HERE
AFTER HALF AN HOURS DELAY THE GREAT NOBLEMAN APPEARED HIS FACE WAS
MORE CADAVEROUS THAN EVER HIS SHOULDERS HAD ROUNDED AND HE SEEMED
TO ME TO BE AN ALTOGETHER OLDER MAN THAN HE HAD BEEN THE MORNING
BEFORE HE GREETED US WITH A STATELY COURTESY AND SEATED HIMSELF AT
HIS DESK HIS RED BEARD STREAMING DOWN ON TO THE TABLE
WELL MR HOLMES SAID HE
BUT MY FRIENDS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THE SECRETARY WHO STOOD BY HIS
MASTERS CHAIR
I THINK YOUR GRACE THAT I COULD SPEAK MORE FREELY IN MR WILDERS
ABSENCE
THE MAN TURNED A SHADE PALER AND CAST A MALIGNANT GLANCE AT HOLMES
IF YOUR GRACE WISHES
YES YES YOU HAD BETTER GO NOW MR HOLMES WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY
MY FRIEND WAITED UNTIL THE DOOR HAD CLOSED BEHIND THE RETREATING
SECRETARY
THE FACT IS YOUR GRACE SAID HE THAT MY COLLEAGUE DR WATSON
AND MYSELF HAD AN ASSURANCE FROM DR HUXTABLE THAT A REWARD HAD BEEN
OFFERED IN THIS CASE I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS CONFIRMED FROM YOUR
OWN LIPS
CERTAINLY MR HOLMES
IT AMOUNTED IF I AM CORRECTLY INFORMED TO FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS TO
ANYONE WHO WILL TELL YOU WHERE YOUR SON IS
EXACTLY
AND ANOTHER THOUSAND TO THE MAN WHO WILL NAME THE PERSON OR PERSONS
WHO KEEP HIM IN CUSTODY
EXACTLY
UNDER THE LATTER HEADING IS INCLUDED NO DOUBT NOT ONLY THOSE WHO
MAY HAVE TAKEN HIM AWAY BUT ALSO THOSE WHO CONSPIRE TO KEEP HIM IN
HIS PRESENT POSITION
YES YES CRIED THE DUKE IMPATIENTLY IF YOU DO YOUR WORK WELL
MR SHERLOCK HOLMES YOU WILL HAVE NO REASON TO COMPLAIN OF NIGGARDLY
TREATMENT
MY FRIEND RUBBED HIS THIN HANDS TOGETHER WITH AN APPEARANCE OF
AVIDITY WHICH WAS A SURPRISE TO ME WHO KNEW HIS FRUGAL TASTES
I FANCY THAT I SEE YOUR GRACES CHEQUEBOOK UPON THE TABLE SAID
HE I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU WOULD MAKE ME OUT A CHEQUE FOR SIX
THOUSAND POUNDS IT WOULD BE AS WELL PERHAPS FOR YOU TO CROSS IT
THE CAPITAL AND COUNTIES BANK OXFORD STREET BRANCH ARE MY AGENTS
HIS GRACE SAT VERY STERN AND UPRIGHT IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED STONILY
AT MY FRIEND
IS THIS A JOKE MR HOLMES IT IS HARDLY A SUBJECT FOR PLEASANTRY
NOT AT ALL YOUR GRACE I WAS NEVER MORE EARNEST IN MY LIFE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEN
I MEAN THAT I HAVE EARNED THE REWARD I KNOW WHERE YOUR SON IS AND
I KNOW SOME AT LEAST OF THOSE WHO ARE HOLDING HIM
THE DUKES BEARD HAD TURNED MORE AGGRESSIVELY RED THAN EVER AGAINST
HIS GHASTLY WHITE FACE
WHERE IS HE HE GASPED HE IS OR WAS LAST NIGHT AT THE FIGHTING COCK INN
ABOUT TWO MILES
FROM YOUR PARK GATE
THE DUKE FELL BACK IN HIS CHAIR
AND WHOM DO YOU ACCUSE
SHERLOCK HOLMESS ANSWER WAS AN ASTOUNDING ONE HE STEPPED SWIFTLY
FORWARD AND TOUCHED THE DUKE UPON THE SHOULDER
I ACCUSE YOU SAID HE AND NOW YOUR GRACE ILL TROUBLE YOU FOR
THAT CHEQUE
NEVER SHALL I FORGET THE DUKES APPEARANCE AS HE SPRANG UP AND CLAWED
WITH HIS HANDS LIKE ONE WHO IS SINKING INTO AN ABYSS THEN WITH AN
EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT OF ARISTOCRATIC SELFCOMMAND HE SAT DOWN AND
SANK HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS IT WAS SOME MINUTES BEFORE HE SPOKE
HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW HE ASKED AT LAST WITHOUT RAISING HIS HEAD
I SAW YOU TOGETHER LAST NIGHT
DOES ANYONE ELSE BESIDES YOUR FRIEND KNOW
I HAVE SPOKEN TO NO ONE
THE DUKE TOOK A PEN IN HIS QUIVERING FINGERS AND OPENED HIS
CHEQUEBOOK
I SHALL BE AS GOOD AS MY WORD MR HOLMES I AM ABOUT TO WRITE YOUR
CHEQUE HOWEVER UNWELCOME THE INFORMATION WHICH YOU HAVE GAINED MAY
BE TO ME WHEN THE OFFER WAS FIRST MADE I LITTLE THOUGHT THE TURN
WHICH EVENTS MIGHT TAKE BUT YOU AND YOUR FRIEND ARE MEN OF
DISCRETION MR HOLMES
I HARDLY UNDERSTAND YOUR GRACE
I MUST PUT IT PLAINLY MR HOLMES IF ONLY YOU TWO KNOW OF THIS
INCIDENT THERE IS NO REASON WHY IT SHOULD GO ANY FARTHER I THINK
TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS IS THE SUM THAT I OWE YOU IS IT NOT
BUT HOLMES SMILED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
I FEAR YOUR GRACE THAT MATTERS CAN HARDLY BE ARRANGED SO EASILY
THERE IS THE DEATH OF THIS SCHOOLMASTER TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
BUT JAMES KNEW NOTHING OF THAT YOU CANNOT HOLD HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR
THAT IT WAS THE WORK OF THIS BRUTAL RUFFIAN WHOM HE HAD THE
MISFORTUNE TO EMPLOY
I MUST TAKE THE VIEW YOUR GRACE THAT WHEN A MAN EMBARKS UPON A
CRIME HE IS MORALLY GUILTY OF ANY OTHER CRIME WHICH MAY SPRING FROM
IT
MORALLY MR HOLMES NO DOUBT YOU ARE RIGHT BUT SURELY NOT IN THE
EYES OF THE LAW A MAN CANNOT BE CONDEMNED FOR A MURDER AT WHICH HE
WAS NOT PRESENT AND WHICH HE LOATHES AND ABHORS AS MUCH AS YOU DO
THE INSTANT THAT HE HEARD OF IT HE MADE A COMPLETE CONFESSION TO ME
SO FILLED WAS HE WITH HORROR AND REMORSE HE LOST NOT AN HOUR IN
BREAKING ENTIRELY WITH THE MURDERER OH MR HOLMES YOU MUST SAVE
HIMYOU MUST SAVE HIM I TELL YOU THAT YOU MUST SAVE HIM THE DUKE
HAD DROPPED THE LAST ATTEMPT AT SELFCOMMAND AND WAS PACING THE ROOM
WITH A CONVULSED FACE AND WITH HIS CLENCHED HANDS RAVING IN THE AIR
AT LAST HE MASTERED HIMSELF AND SAT DOWN ONCE MORE AT HIS DESK I
APPRECIATE YOUR CONDUCT IN COMING HERE BEFORE YOU SPOKE TO ANYONE
ELSE SAID HE AT LEAST WE MAY TAKE COUNSEL HOW FAR WE CAN
MINIMIZE THIS HIDEOUS SCANDAL
EXACTLY SAID HOLMES I THINK YOUR GRACE THAT THIS CAN ONLY BE
DONE BY ABSOLUTE AND COMPLETE FRANKNESS BETWEEN US I AM DISPOSED TO
HELP YOUR GRACE TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO I
MUST UNDERSTAND TO THE LAST DETAIL HOW THE MATTER STANDS I REALIZE
THAT YOUR WORDS APPLIED TO MR JAMES WILDER AND THAT HE IS NOT THE
MURDERER
NO THE MURDERER HAS ESCAPED
SHERLOCK HOLMES SMILED DEMURELY
YOUR GRACE CAN HARDLY HAVE HEARD OF ANY SMALL REPUTATION WHICH I
POSSESS OR YOU WOULD NOT IMAGINE THAT IT IS SO EASY TO ESCAPE ME
MR REUBEN HAYES WAS ARRESTED AT CHESTERFIELD ON MY INFORMATION AT
ELEVEN OCLOCK LAST NIGHT I HAD A TELEGRAM FROM THE HEAD OF THE
LOCAL POLICE BEFORE I LEFT THE SCHOOL THIS MORNING
THE DUKE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND STARED WITH AMAZEMENT AT MY
FRIEND
YOU SEEM TO HAVE POWERS THAT ARE HARDLY HUMAN SAID HE SO REUBEN
HAYES IS TAKEN I AM RIGHT GLAD TO HEAR IT IF IT WILL NOT REACT UPON
THE FATE OF JAMES
YOUR SECRETARY
NO SIR MY SON
IT WAS HOLMESS TURN TO LOOK ASTONISHED
I CONFESS THAT THIS IS ENTIRELY NEW TO ME YOUR GRACE I MUST BEG
YOU TO BE MORE EXPLICIT
I WILL CONCEAL NOTHING FROM YOU I AGREE WITH YOU THAT COMPLETE
FRANKNESS HOWEVER PAINFUL IT MAY BE TO ME IS THE BEST POLICY IN
THIS DESPERATE SITUATION TO WHICH JAMESS FOLLY AND JEALOUSY HAVE
REDUCED US WHEN I WAS A VERY YOUNG MAN MR HOLMES I LOVED WITH
SUCH A LOVE AS COMES ONLY ONCE IN A LIFETIME I OFFERED THE LADY
MARRIAGE BUT SHE REFUSED IT ON THE GROUNDS THAT SUCH A MATCH MIGHT
MAR MY CAREER HAD SHE LIVED I WOULD CERTAINLY NEVER HAVE MARRIED
ANYONE ELSE SHE DIED AND LEFT THIS ONE CHILD WHOM FOR HER SAKE I
HAVE CHERISHED AND CARED FOR I COULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE PATERNITY
TO THE WORLD BUT I GAVE HIM THE BEST OF EDUCATIONS AND SINCE HE
CAME TO MANHOOD I HAVE KEPT HIM NEAR MY PERSON HE SURPRISED MY
SECRET AND HAS PRESUMED EVER SINCE UPON THE CLAIM WHICH HE HAS UPON
ME AND UPON HIS POWER OF PROVOKING A SCANDAL WHICH WOULD BE
ABHORRENT TO ME HIS PRESENCE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE UNHAPPY
ISSUE OF MY MARRIAGE ABOVE ALL HE HATED MY YOUNG LEGITIMATE HEIR
FROM THE FIRST WITH A PERSISTENT HATRED YOU MAY WELL ASK ME WHY
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I STILL KEPT JAMES UNDER MY ROOF I ANSWER
THAT IT WAS BECAUSE I COULD SEE HIS MOTHERS FACE IN HIS AND THAT
FOR HER DEAR SAKE THERE WAS NO END TO MY LONGSUFFERING ALL HER
PRETTY WAYS TOOTHERE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM WHICH HE COULD NOT
SUGGEST AND BRING BACK TO MY MEMORY I COULD NOT SEND HIM AWAY BUT I
FEARED SO MUCH LEST HE SHOULD DO ARTHURTHAT IS LORD SALTIREA
MISCHIEF THAT I DISPATCHED HIM FOR SAFETY TO DR HUXTABLES SCHOOL
JAMES CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THIS FELLOW HAYES BECAUSE THE MAN WAS A
TENANT OF MINE AND JAMES ACTED AS AGENT THE FELLOW WAS A RASCAL
FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IN SOME EXTRAORDINARY WAY JAMES BECAME
INTIMATE WITH HIM HE HAD ALWAYS A TASTE FOR LOW COMPANY WHEN JAMES
DETERMINED TO KIDNAP LORD SALTIRE IT WAS OF THIS MANS SERVICE THAT
HE AVAILED HIMSELF YOU REMEMBER THAT I WROTE TO ARTHUR UPON THAT
LAST DAY WELL JAMES OPENED THE LETTER AND INSERTED A NOTE ASKING
ARTHUR TO MEET HIM IN A LITTLE WOOD CALLED THE RAGGED SHAW WHICH IS
NEAR TO THE SCHOOL HE USED THE DUCHESSS NAME AND IN THAT WAY GOT
THE BOY TO COME THAT EVENING JAMES BICYCLED OVERI AM TELLING YOU
WHAT HE HAS HIMSELF CONFESSED TO MEAND HE TOLD ARTHUR WHOM HE MET
IN THE WOOD THAT HIS MOTHER LONGED TO SEE HIM THAT SHE WAS AWAITING
HIM ON THE MOOR AND THAT IF HE WOULD COME BACK INTO THE WOOD AT
MIDNIGHT HE WOULD FIND A MAN WITH A HORSE WHO WOULD TAKE HIM TO HER
POOR ARTHUR FELL INTO THE TRAP HE CAME TO THE APPOINTMENT AND FOUND
THIS FELLOW HAYES WITH A LED PONY ARTHUR MOUNTED AND THEY SET OFF
TOGETHER IT APPEARSTHOUGH THIS JAMES ONLY HEARD YESTERDAYTHAT
THEY WERE PURSUED THAT HAYES STRUCK THE PURSUER WITH HIS STICK AND
THAT THE MAN DIED OF HIS INJURIES HAYES BROUGHT ARTHUR TO HIS
PUBLICHOUSE THE FIGHTING COCK WHERE HE WAS CONFINED IN AN UPPER
ROOM UNDER THE CARE OF MRS HAYES WHO IS A KINDLY WOMAN BUT
ENTIRELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF HER BRUTAL HUSBAND
WELL MR HOLMES THAT WAS THE STATE OF AFFAIRS WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU
TWO DAYS AGO I HAD NO MORE IDEA OF THE TRUTH THAN YOU YOU WILL ASK
ME WHAT WAS JAMESS MOTIVE IN DOING SUCH A DEED I ANSWER THAT THERE
WAS A GREAT DEAL WHICH WAS UNREASONING AND FANATICAL IN THE HATRED
WHICH HE BORE MY HEIR IN HIS VIEW HE SHOULD HIMSELF HAVE BEEN HEIR
OF ALL MY ESTATES AND HE DEEPLY RESENTED THOSE SOCIAL LAWS WHICH
MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE AT THE SAME TIME HE HAD A DEFINITE MOTIVE ALSO
HE WAS EAGER THAT I SHOULD BREAK THE ENTAIL AND HE WAS OF OPINION
THAT IT LAY IN MY POWER TO DO SO HE INTENDED TO MAKE A BARGAIN WITH
METO RESTORE ARTHUR IF I WOULD BREAK THE ENTAIL AND SO MAKE IT
POSSIBLE FOR THE ESTATE TO BE LEFT TO HIM BY WILL HE KNEW WELL THAT
I SHOULD NEVER WILLINGLY INVOKE THE AID OF THE POLICE AGAINST HIM I
SAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE PROPOSED SUCH A BARGAIN TO ME BUT HE DID NOT
ACTUALLY DO SO FOR EVENTS MOVED TOO QUICKLY FOR HIM AND HE HAD NOT
TIME TO PUT HIS PLANS INTO PRACTICE
WHAT BROUGHT ALL HIS WICKED SCHEME TO WRECK WAS YOUR DISCOVERY OF
THIS MAN HEIDEGGERS DEAD BODY JAMES WAS SEIZED WITH HORROR AT THE
NEWS IT CAME TO US YESTERDAY AS WE SAT TOGETHER IN THIS STUDY DR
HUXTABLE HAD SENT A TELEGRAM JAMES WAS SO OVERWHELMED WITH GRIEF AND
AGITATION THAT MY SUSPICIONS WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN ENTIRELY ABSENT
ROSE INSTANTLY TO A CERTAINTY AND I TAXED HIM WITH THE DEED HE MADE
A COMPLETE VOLUNTARY CONFESSION THEN HE IMPLORED ME TO KEEP HIS
SECRET FOR THREE DAYS LONGER SO AS TO GIVE HIS WRETCHED ACCOMPLICE A
CHANCE OF SAVING HIS GUILTY LIFE I YIELDEDAS I HAVE ALWAYS
YIELDEDTO HIS PRAYERS AND INSTANTLY JAMES HURRIED OFF TO THE
FIGHTING COCK TO WARN HAYES AND GIVE HIM THE MEANS OF FLIGHT I COULD
NOT GO THERE BY DAYLIGHT WITHOUT PROVOKING COMMENT BUT AS SOON AS
NIGHT FELL I HURRIED OFF TO SEE MY DEAR ARTHUR I FOUND HIM SAFE AND
WELL BUT HORRIFIED BEYOND EXPRESSION BY THE DREADFUL DEED HE HAD
WITNESSED IN DEFERENCE TO MY PROMISE AND MUCH AGAINST MY WILL I
CONSENTED TO LEAVE HIM THERE FOR THREE DAYS UNDER THE CHARGE OF MRS
HAYES SINCE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO INFORM THE
POLICE WHERE HE WAS WITHOUT TELLING THEM ALSO WHO WAS THE MURDERER
AND I COULD NOT SEE HOW THAT MURDERER COULD BE PUNISHED WITHOUT RUIN
TO MY UNFORTUNATE JAMES YOU ASKED FOR FRANKNESS MR HOLMES AND I
HAVE TAKEN YOU AT YOUR WORD FOR I HAVE NOW TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
WITHOUT AN ATTEMPT AT CIRCUMLOCUTION OR CONCEALMENT DO YOU IN TURN
BE AS FRANK WITH ME
I WILL SAID HOLMES IN THE FIRST PLACE YOUR GRACE I AM BOUND TO
TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE PLACED YOURSELF IN A MOST SERIOUS POSITION IN
THE EYES OF THE LAW YOU HAVE CONDONED A FELONY AND YOU HAVE AIDED
THE ESCAPE OF A MURDERER FOR I CANNOT DOUBT THAT ANY MONEY WHICH WAS
TAKEN BY JAMES WILDER TO AID HIS ACCOMPLICE IN HIS FLIGHT CAME FROM
YOUR GRACES PURSE
THE DUKE BOWED HIS ASSENT
THIS IS INDEED A MOST SERIOUS MATTER EVEN MORE CULPABLE IN MY
OPINION YOUR GRACE IS YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS YOUR YOUNGER SON YOU
LEAVE HIM IN THIS DEN FOR THREE DAYS
UNDER SOLEMN PROMISES
WHAT ARE PROMISES TO SUCH PEOPLE AS THESE YOU HAVE NO GUARANTEE
THAT HE WILL NOT BE SPIRITED AWAY AGAIN TO HUMOUR YOUR GUILTY ELDER
SON YOU HAVE EXPOSED YOUR INNOCENT YOUNGER SON TO IMMINENT AND
UNNECESSARY DANGER IT WAS A MOST UNJUSTIFIABLE ACTION
THE PROUD LORD OF HOLDERNESSE WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE SO RATED IN
HIS OWN DUCAL HALL THE BLOOD FLUSHED INTO HIS HIGH FOREHEAD BUT HIS
CONSCIENCE HELD HIM DUMB
I WILL HELP YOU BUT ON ONE CONDITION ONLY IT IS THAT YOU RING FOR
THE FOOTMAN AND LET ME GIVE SUCH ORDERS AS I LIKE
WITHOUT A WORD THE DUKE PRESSED THE ELECTRIC BELL A SERVANT ENTERED
YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR SAID HOLMES THAT YOUR YOUNG MASTER IS
FOUND IT IS THE DUKES DESIRE THAT THE CARRIAGE SHALL GO AT ONCE TO
THE FIGHTING COCK INN TO BRING LORD SALTIRE HOME
NOW SAID HOLMES WHEN THE REJOICING LACKEY HAD DISAPPEARED
HAVING SECURED THE FUTURE WE CAN AFFORD TO BE MORE LENIENT WITH THE
PAST I AM NOT IN AN OFFICIAL POSITION AND THERE IS NO REASON SO
LONG AS THE ENDS OF JUSTICE ARE SERVED WHY I SHOULD DISCLOSE ALL
THAT I KNOW AS TO HAYES I SAY NOTHING THE GALLOWS AWAITS HIM AND I
WOULD DO NOTHING TO SAVE HIM FROM IT WHAT HE WILL DIVULGE I CANNOT
TELL BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOUR GRACE COULD MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND
THAT IT IS TO HIS INTEREST TO BE SILENT FROM THE POLICE POINT OF
VIEW HE WILL HAVE KIDNAPPED THE BOY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RANSOM IF
THEY DO NOT THEMSELVES FIND IT OUT I SEE NO REASON WHY I SHOULD
PROMPT THEM TO TAKE A BROADER POINT OF VIEW I WOULD WARN YOUR GRACE
HOWEVER THAT THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF MR JAMES WILDER IN YOUR
HOUSEHOLD CAN ONLY LEAD TO MISFORTUNE
I UNDERSTAND THAT MR HOLMES AND IT IS ALREADY SETTLED THAT HE
SHALL LEAVE ME FOR EVER AND GO TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE IN AUSTRALIA
IN THAT CASE YOUR GRACE SINCE YOU HAVE YOURSELF STATED THAT ANY
UNHAPPINESS IN YOUR MARRIED LIFE WAS CAUSED BY HIS PRESENCE I WOULD
SUGGEST THAT YOU MAKE SUCH AMENDS AS YOU CAN TO THE DUCHESS AND THAT
YOU TRY TO RESUME THOSE RELATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN SO UNHAPPILY
INTERRUPTED
THAT ALSO I HAVE ARRANGED MR HOLMES I WROTE TO THE DUCHESS THIS
MORNING
IN THAT CASE SAID HOLMES RISING I THINK THAT MY FRIEND AND I
CAN CONGRATULATE OURSELVES UPON SEVERAL MOST HAPPY RESULTS FROM OUR
LITTLE VISIT TO THE NORTH THERE IS ONE OTHER SMALL POINT UPON WHICH
I DESIRE SOME LIGHT THIS FELLOW HAYES HAD SHOD HIS HORSES WITH SHOES
WHICH COUNTERFEITED THE TRACKS OF COWS WAS IT FROM MR WILDER THAT
HE LEARNED SO EXTRAORDINARY A DEVICE
THE DUKE STOOD IN THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT WITH A LOOK OF INTENSE
SURPRISE ON HIS FACE THEN HE OPENED A DOOR AND SHOWED US INTO A
LARGE ROOM FURNISHED AS A MUSEUM HE LED THE WAY TO A GLASS CASE IN A
CORNER AND POINTED TO THE INSCRIPTION
THESE SHOES IT RAN WERE DUG UP IN THE MOAT OF HOLDERNESSE HALL
THEY ARE FOR THE USE OF HORSES BUT THEY ARE SHAPED BELOW WITH A
CLOVEN FOOT OF IRON SO AS TO THROW PURSUERS OFF THE TRACK THEY ARE
SUPPOSED TO HAVE BELONGED TO SOME OF THE MARAUDING BARONS OF
HOLDERNESSE IN THE MIDDLE AGES
HOLMES OPENED THE CASE AND MOISTENING HIS FINGER HE PASSED IT ALONG
THE SHOE A THIN FILM OF RECENT MUD WAS LEFT UPON HIS SKIN
THANK YOU SAID HE AS HE REPLACED THE GLASS IT IS THE SECOND
MOST INTERESTING OBJECT THAT I HAVE SEEN IN THE NORTH
AND THE FIRST
HOLMES FOLDED UP HIS CHEQUE AND PLACED IT CAREFULLY IN HIS NOTEBOOK
I AM A POOR MAN SAID HE AS HE PATTED IT AFFECTIONATELY AND THRUST
IT INTO THE DEPTHS OF HIS INNER POCKET
THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER
I HAVE NEVER KNOWN MY FRIEND TO BE IN BETTER FORM BOTH MENTAL AND
PHYSICAL THAN IN THE YEAR HIS INCREASING FAME HAD BROUGHT WITH
IT AN IMMENSE PRACTICE AND I SHOULD BE GUILTY OF AN INDISCRETION IF
I WERE EVEN TO HINT AT THE IDENTITY OF SOME OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS
CLIENTS WHO CROSSED OUR HUMBLE THRESHOLD IN BAKER STREET HOLMES
HOWEVER LIKE ALL GREAT ARTISTS LIVED FOR HIS ARTS SAKE AND SAVE
IN THE CASE OF THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE I HAVE SELDOM KNOWN HIM CLAIM
ANY LARGE REWARD FOR HIS INESTIMABLE SERVICES SO UNWORLDLY WAS
HEOR SO CAPRICIOUSTHAT HE FREQUENTLY REFUSED HIS HELP TO THE
POWERFUL AND WEALTHY WHERE THE PROBLEM MADE NO APPEAL TO HIS
SYMPATHIES WHILE HE WOULD DEVOTE WEEKS OF MOST INTENSE APPLICATION
TO THE AFFAIRS OF SOME HUMBLE CLIENT WHOSE CASE PRESENTED THOSE
STRANGE AND DRAMATIC QUALITIES WHICH APPEALED TO HIS IMAGINATION AND
CHALLENGED HIS INGENUITY
IN THIS MEMORABLE YEAR A CURIOUS AND INCONGRUOUS SUCCESSION OF
CASES HAD ENGAGED HIS ATTENTION RANGING FROM HIS FAMOUS
INVESTIGATION OF THE SUDDEN DEATH OF CARDINAL TOSCAAN INQUIRY WHICH
WAS CARRIED OUT BY HIM AT THE EXPRESS DESIRE OF HIS HOLINESS THE
POPEDOWN TO HIS ARREST OF WILSON THE NOTORIOUS CANARYTRAINER
WHICH REMOVED A PLAGUESPOT FROM THE EASTEND OF LONDON CLOSE ON THE
HEELS OF THESE TWO FAMOUS CASES CAME THE TRAGEDY OF WOODMANS LEE
AND THE VERY OBSCURE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH SURROUNDED THE DEATH OF
CAPTAIN PETER CAREY NO RECORD OF THE DOINGS OF MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
WOULD BE COMPLETE WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE SOME ACCOUNT OF THIS VERY
UNUSUAL AFFAIR
DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF JULY MY FRIEND HAD BEEN ABSENT SO OFTEN AND
SO LONG FROM OUR LODGINGS THAT I KNEW HE HAD SOMETHING ON HAND THE
FACT THAT SEVERAL ROUGHLOOKING MEN CALLED DURING THAT TIME AND
INQUIRED FOR CAPTAIN BASIL MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT HOLMES WAS WORKING
SOMEWHERE UNDER ONE OF THE NUMEROUS DISGUISES AND NAMES WITH WHICH HE
CONCEALED HIS OWN FORMIDABLE IDENTITY HE HAD AT LEAST FIVE SMALL
REFUGES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF LONDON IN WHICH HE WAS ABLE TO CHANGE
HIS PERSONALITY HE SAID NOTHING OF HIS BUSINESS TO ME AND IT WAS
NOT MY HABIT TO FORCE A CONFIDENCE THE FIRST POSITIVE SIGN WHICH HE
GAVE ME OF THE DIRECTION WHICH HIS INVESTIGATION WAS TAKING WAS AN
EXTRAORDINARY ONE HE HAD GONE OUT BEFORE BREAKFAST AND I HAD SAT
DOWN TO MINE WHEN HE STRODE INTO THE ROOM HIS HAT UPON HIS HEAD AND
A HUGE BARBEDHEADED SPEAR TUCKED LIKE AN UMBRELLA UNDER HIS ARM
GOOD GRACIOUS HOLMES I CRIED YOU DONT MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU
HAVE BEEN WALKING ABOUT LONDON WITH THAT THING
I DROVE TO THE BUTCHERS AND BACK
THE BUTCHERS
AND I RETURN WITH AN EXCELLENT APPETITE THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION
MY DEAR WATSON OF THE VALUE OF EXERCISE BEFORE BREAKFAST BUT I AM
PREPARED TO BET THAT YOU WILL NOT GUESS THE FORM THAT MY EXERCISE HAS
TAKEN
I WILL NOT ATTEMPT IT
HE CHUCKLED AS HE POURED OUT THE COFFEE
IF YOU COULD HAVE LOOKED INTO ALLARDYCES BACK SHOP YOU WOULD HAVE
SEEN A DEAD PIG SWUNG FROM A HOOK IN THE CEILING AND A GENTLEMAN IN
HIS SHIRTSLEEVES FURIOUSLY STABBING AT IT WITH THIS WEAPON I WAS
THAT ENERGETIC PERSON AND I HAVE SATISFIED MYSELF THAT BY NO
EXERTION OF MY STRENGTH CAN I TRANSFIX THE PIG WITH A SINGLE BLOW
PERHAPS YOU WOULD CARE TO TRY
NOT FOR WORLDS BUT WHY WERE YOU DOING THIS
BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO ME TO HAVE AN INDIRECT BEARING UPON THE MYSTERY
OF WOODMANS LEE AH HOPKINS I GOT YOUR WIRE LAST NIGHT AND I HAVE
BEEN EXPECTING YOU COME AND JOIN US
OUR VISITOR WAS AN EXCEEDINGLY ALERT MAN THIRTY YEARS OF AGE
DRESSED IN A QUIET TWEED SUIT BUT RETAINING THE ERECT BEARING OF ONE
WHO WAS ACCUSTOMED TO OFFICIAL UNIFORM I RECOGNISED HIM AT ONCE AS
STANLEY HOPKINS A YOUNG POLICE INSPECTOR FOR WHOSE FUTURE HOLMES HAD
HIGH HOPES WHILE HE IN TURN PROFESSED THE ADMIRATION AND RESPECT OF
A PUPIL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF THE FAMOUS AMATEUR HOPKINSS
BROW WAS CLOUDED AND HE SAT DOWN WITH AN AIR OF DEEP DEJECTION
NO THANK YOU SIR I BREAKFASTED BEFORE I CAME ROUND I SPENT THE
NIGHT IN TOWN FOR I CAME UP YESTERDAY TO REPORT
AND WHAT HAD YOU TO REPORT
FAILURE SIR ABSOLUTE FAILURE
YOU HAVE MADE NO PROGRESS
NONE
DEAR ME I MUST HAVE A LOOK AT THE MATTER
I WISH TO HEAVENS THAT YOU WOULD MR HOLMES ITS MY FIRST BIG
CHANCE AND I AM AT MY WITS END FOR GOODNESS SAKE COME DOWN AND
LEND ME A HAND
WELL WELL IT JUST HAPPENS THAT I HAVE ALREADY READ ALL THE
AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INCLUDING THE REPORT OF THE INQUEST WITH SOME
CARE BY THE WAY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT TOBACCOPOUCH FOUND ON THE
SCENE OF THE CRIME IS THERE NO CLUE THERE
HOPKINS LOOKED SURPRISED
IT WAS THE MANS OWN POUCH SIR HIS INITIALS WERE INSIDE IT AND IT
WAS OF SEALSKINAND HE AN OLD SEALER
BUT HE HAD NO PIPE
NO SIR WE COULD FIND NO PIPE INDEED HE SMOKED VERY LITTLE AND
YET HE MIGHT HAVE KEPT SOME TOBACCO FOR HIS FRIENDS
NO DOUBT I ONLY MENTION IT BECAUSE IF I HAD BEEN HANDLING THE CASE
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLINED TO MAKE THAT THE STARTINGPOINT OF MY
INVESTIGATION HOWEVER MY FRIEND DR WATSON KNOWS NOTHING OF THIS
MATTER AND I SHOULD BE NONE THE WORSE FOR HEARING THE SEQUENCE OF
EVENTS ONCE MORE JUST GIVE US SOME SHORT SKETCH OF THE ESSENTIALS
STANLEY HOPKINS DREW A SLIP OF PAPER FROM HIS POCKET
I HAVE A FEW DATES HERE WHICH WILL GIVE YOU THE CAREER OF THE DEAD
MAN CAPTAIN PETER CAREY HE WAS BORN IN FIFTY YEARS OF AGE HE
WAS A MOST DARING AND SUCCESSFUL SEAL AND WHALE FISHER IN HE
COMMANDED THE STEAM SEALER SEA UNICORN OF DUNDEE HE HAD THEN HAD
SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL VOYAGES IN SUCCESSION AND IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR
HE RETIRED AFTER THAT HE TRAVELLED FOR SOME YEARS AND FINALLY
HE BOUGHT A SMALL PLACE CALLED WOODMANS LEE NEAR FOREST ROW IN
SUSSEX THERE HE HAS LIVED FOR SIX YEARS AND THERE HE DIED JUST A
WEEK AGO TODAY
THERE WERE SOME MOST SINGULAR POINTS ABOUT THE MAN IN ORDINARY LIFE
HE WAS A STRICT PURITANA SILENT GLOOMY FELLOW HIS HOUSEHOLD
CONSISTED OF HIS WIFE HIS DAUGHTER AGED TWENTY AND TWO FEMALE
SERVANTS THESE LAST WERE CONTINUALLY CHANGING FOR IT WAS NEVER A
VERY CHEERY SITUATION AND SOMETIMES IT BECAME PAST ALL BEARING THE
MAN WAS AN INTERMITTENT DRUNKARD AND WHEN HE HAD THE FIT ON HIM HE
WAS A PERFECT FIEND HE HAS BEEN KNOWN TO DRIVE HIS WIFE AND HIS
DAUGHTER OUT OF DOORS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND FLOG THEM
THROUGH THE PARK UNTIL THE WHOLE VILLAGE OUTSIDE THE GATES WAS
AROUSED BY THEIR SCREAMS
HE WAS SUMMONED ONCE FOR A SAVAGE ASSAULT UPON THE OLD VICAR WHO
HAD CALLED UPON HIM TO REMONSTRATE WITH HIM UPON HIS CONDUCT IN
SHORT MR HOLMES YOU WOULD GO FAR BEFORE YOU FOUND A MORE DANGEROUS
MAN THAN PETER CAREY AND I HAVE HEARD THAT HE BORE THE SAME
CHARACTER WHEN HE COMMANDED HIS SHIP HE WAS KNOWN IN THE TRADE AS
BLACK PETER AND THE NAME WAS GIVEN HIM NOT ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS
SWARTHY FEATURES AND THE COLOUR OF HIS HUGE BEARD BUT FOR THE
HUMOURS WHICH WERE THE TERROR OF ALL AROUND HIM I NEED NOT SAY THAT
HE WAS LOATHED AND AVOIDED BY EVERY ONE OF HIS NEIGHBOURS AND THAT I
HAVE NOT HEARD ONE SINGLE WORD OF SORROW ABOUT HIS TERRIBLE END
YOU MUST HAVE READ IN THE ACCOUNT OF THE INQUEST ABOUT THE MANS
CABIN MR HOLMES BUT PERHAPS YOUR FRIEND HERE HAS NOT HEARD OF IT
HE HAD BUILT HIMSELF A WOODEN OUTHOUSEHE ALWAYS CALLED IT THE
CABINA FEW HUNDRED YARDS FROM HIS HOUSE AND IT WAS HERE THAT HE
SLEPT EVERY NIGHT IT WAS A LITTLE SINGLEROOMED HUT SIXTEEN FEET
BY TEN HE KEPT THE KEY IN HIS POCKET MADE HIS OWN BED CLEANED IT
HIMSELF AND ALLOWED NO OTHER FOOT TO CROSS THE THRESHOLD THERE ARE
SMALL WINDOWS ON EACH SIDE WHICH WERE COVERED BY CURTAINS AND NEVER
OPENED ONE OF THESE WINDOWS WAS TURNED TOWARDS THE HIGH ROAD AND
WHEN THE LIGHT BURNED IN IT AT NIGHT THE FOLK USED TO POINT IT OUT TO
EACH OTHER AND WONDER WHAT BLACK PETER WAS DOING IN THERE THATS THE
WINDOW MR HOLMES WHICH GAVE US ONE OF THE FEW BITS OF POSITIVE
EVIDENCE THAT CAME OUT AT THE INQUEST
YOU REMEMBER THAT A STONEMASON NAMED SLATER WALKING FROM FOREST
ROW ABOUT ONE OCLOCK IN THE MORNINGTWO DAYS BEFORE THE
MURDERSTOPPED AS HE PASSED THE GROUNDS AND LOOKED AT THE SQUARE OF
LIGHT STILL SHINING AMONG THE TREES HE SWEARS THAT THE SHADOW OF A
MANS HEAD TURNED SIDEWAYS WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE ON THE BLIND AND THAT
THIS SHADOW WAS CERTAINLY NOT THAT OF PETER CAREY WHOM HE KNEW WELL
IT WAS THAT OF A BEARDED MAN BUT THE BEARD WAS SHORT AND BRISTLED
FORWARDS IN A WAY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE CAPTAIN SO HE
SAYS BUT HE HAD BEEN TWO HOURS IN THE PUBLICHOUSE AND IT IS SOME
DISTANCE FROM THE ROAD TO THE WINDOW BESIDES THIS REFERS TO THE
MONDAY AND THE CRIME WAS DONE UPON THE WEDNESDAY
ON THE TUESDAY PETER CAREY WAS IN ONE OF HIS BLACKEST MOODS FLUSHED
WITH DRINK AND AS SAVAGE AS A DANGEROUS WILD BEAST HE ROAMED ABOUT
THE HOUSE AND THE WOMEN RAN FOR IT WHEN THEY HEARD HIM COMING LATE
IN THE EVENING HE WENT DOWN TO HIS OWN HUT ABOUT TWO OCLOCK THE
FOLLOWING MORNING HIS DAUGHTER WHO SLEPT WITH HER WINDOW OPEN HEARD
A MOST FEARFUL YELL FROM THAT DIRECTION BUT IT WAS NO UNUSUAL THING
FOR HIM TO BAWL AND SHOUT WHEN HE WAS IN DRINK SO NO NOTICE WAS
TAKEN ON RISING AT SEVEN ONE OF THE MAIDS NOTICED THAT THE DOOR OF
THE HUT WAS OPEN BUT SO GREAT WAS THE TERROR WHICH THE MAN CAUSED
THAT IT WAS MIDDAY BEFORE ANYONE WOULD VENTURE DOWN TO SEE WHAT HAD
BECOME OF HIM PEEPING INTO THE OPEN DOOR THEY SAW A SIGHT WHICH SENT
THEM FLYING WITH WHITE FACES INTO THE VILLAGE WITHIN AN HOUR I WAS
ON THE SPOT AND HAD TAKEN OVER THE CASE
WELL I HAVE FAIRLY STEADY NERVES AS YOU KNOW MR HOLMES BUT I
GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT I GOT A SHAKE WHEN I PUT MY HEAD INTO THAT
LITTLE HOUSE IT WAS DRONING LIKE A HARMONIUM WITH THE FLIES AND
BLUEBOTTLES AND THE FLOOR AND WALLS WERE LIKE A SLAUGHTERHOUSE HE
HAD CALLED IT A CABIN AND A CABIN IT WAS SURE ENOUGH FOR YOU WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE IN A SHIP THERE WAS A BUNK AT ONE END A
SEACHEST MAPS AND CHARTS A PICTURE OF THE SEA UNICORN A LINE OF
LOGBOOKS ON A SHELF ALL EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD EXPECT TO FIND IT IN A
CAPTAINS ROOM AND THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WAS THE MAN HIMSELF
HIS FACE TWISTED LIKE A LOST SOUL IN TORMENT AND HIS GREAT BRINDLED
BEARD STUCK UPWARDS IN HIS AGONY RIGHT THROUGH HIS BROAD BREAST A
STEEL HARPOON HAD BEEN DRIVEN AND IT HAD SUNK DEEP INTO THE WOOD OF
THE WALL BEHIND HIM HE WAS PINNED LIKE A BEETLE ON A CARD OF
COURSE HE WAS QUITE DEAD AND HAD BEEN SO FROM THE INSTANT THAT HE
HAD UTTERED THAT LAST YELL OF AGONY
I KNOW YOUR METHODS SIR AND I APPLIED THEM BEFORE I PERMITTED
ANYTHING TO BE MOVED I EXAMINED MOST CAREFULLY THE GROUND OUTSIDE
AND ALSO THE FLOOR OF THE ROOM THERE WERE NO FOOTMARKS
MEANING THAT YOU SAW NONE
I ASSURE YOU SIR THAT THERE WERE NONE
MY GOOD HOPKINS I HAVE INVESTIGATED MANY CRIMES BUT I HAVE NEVER
YET SEEN ONE WHICH WAS COMMITTED BY A FLYING CREATURE AS LONG AS THE
CRIMINAL REMAINS UPON TWO LEGS SO LONG MUST THERE BE SOME
INDENTATION SOME ABRASION SOME TRIFLING DISPLACEMENT WHICH CAN BE
DETECTED BY THE SCIENTIFIC SEARCHER IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THIS
BLOODBESPATTERED ROOM CONTAINED NO TRACE WHICH COULD HAVE AIDED US
I UNDERSTAND HOWEVER FROM THE INQUEST THAT THERE WERE SOME OBJECTS
WHICH YOU FAILED TO OVERLOOK
THE YOUNG INSPECTOR WINCED AT MY COMPANIONS IRONICAL COMMENTS
I WAS A FOOL NOT TO CALL YOU IN AT THE TIME MR HOLMES HOWEVER
THATS PAST PRAYING FOR NOW YES THERE WERE SEVERAL OBJECTS IN THE
ROOM WHICH CALLED FOR SPECIAL ATTENTION ONE WAS THE HARPOON WITH
WHICH THE DEED WAS COMMITTED IT HAD BEEN SNATCHED DOWN FROM A RACK
ON THE WALL TWO OTHERS REMAINED THERE AND THERE WAS A VACANT PLACE
FOR THE THIRD ON THE STOCK WAS ENGRAVED SS SEA UNICORN DUNDEE
THIS SEEMED TO ESTABLISH THAT THE CRIME HAD BEEN DONE IN A MOMENT OF
FURY AND THAT THE MURDERER HAD SEIZED THE FIRST WEAPON WHICH CAME IN
HIS WAY THE FACT THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED AT TWO IN THE MORNING
AND YET PETER CAREY WAS FULLY DRESSED SUGGESTED THAT HE HAD AN
APPOINTMENT WITH THE MURDERER WHICH IS BORNE OUT BY THE FACT THAT A
BOTTLE OF RUM AND TWO DIRTY GLASSES STOOD UPON THE TABLE
YES SAID HOLMES I THINK THAT BOTH INFERENCES ARE PERMISSIBLE
WAS THERE ANY OTHER SPIRIT BUT RUM IN THE ROOM
YES THERE WAS A TANTALUS CONTAINING BRANDY AND WHISKY ON THE
SEACHEST IT IS OF NO IMPORTANCE TO US HOWEVER SINCE THE DECANTERS
WERE FULL AND IT HAD THEREFORE NOT BEEN USED
FOR ALL THAT ITS PRESENCE HAS SOME SIGNIFICANCE SAID HOLMES
HOWEVER LET US HEAR SOME MORE ABOUT THE OBJECTS WHICH DO SEEM TO
YOU TO BEAR UPON THE CASE
THERE WAS THIS TOBACCOPOUCH UPON THE TABLE
WHAT PART OF THE TABLE
IT LAY IN THE MIDDLE IT WAS OF COARSE SEALSKINTHE
STRAIGHTHAIRED SKIN WITH A LEATHER THONG TO BIND IT INSIDE WAS
PC ON THE FLAP THERE WAS HALF AN OUNCE OF STRONG SHIPS TOBACCO
IN IT
EXCELLENT WHAT MORE
STANLEY HOPKINS DREW FROM HIS POCKET A DRABCOVERED NOTEBOOK THE
OUTSIDE WAS ROUGH AND WORN THE LEAVES DISCOLOURED ON THE FIRST PAGE
WERE WRITTEN THE INITIALS JHN AND THE DATE HOLMES LAID
IT ON THE TABLE AND EXAMINED IT IN HIS MINUTE WAY WHILE HOPKINS AND
I GAZED OVER EACH SHOULDER ON THE SECOND PAGE WERE THE PRINTED
LETTERS CPR AND THEN CAME SEVERAL SHEETS OF NUMBERS ANOTHER
HEADING WAS ARGENTINE ANOTHER COSTA RICA AND ANOTHER SAN PAULO
EACH WITH PAGES OF SIGNS AND FIGURES AFTER IT
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE ASKED HOLMES
THEY APPEAR TO BE LISTS OF STOCK EXCHANGE SECURITIES I THOUGHT THAT
JHN WERE THE INITIALS OF A BROKER AND THAT CPR MAY HAVE
BEEN HIS CLIENT
TRY CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY SAID HOLMES
STANLEY HOPKINS SWORE BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND STRUCK HIS THIGH WITH HIS
CLENCHED HAND
WHAT A FOOL I HAVE BEEN HE CRIED OF COURSE IT IS AS YOU SAY
THEN JHN ARE THE ONLY INITIALS WE HAVE TO SOLVE I HAVE ALREADY
EXAMINED THE OLD STOCK EXCHANGE LISTS AND I CAN FIND NO ONE IN EITHER
IN THE HOUSE OR AMONG THE OUTSIDE BROKERS WHOSE INITIALS
CORRESPOND WITH THESE YET I FEEL THAT THE CLUE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
ONE THAT I HOLD YOU WILL ADMIT MR HOLMES THAT THERE IS A
POSSIBILITY THAT THESE INITIALS ARE THOSE OF THE SECOND PERSON WHO
WAS PRESENTIN OTHER WORDS OF THE MURDERER I WOULD ALSO URGE THAT
THE INTRODUCTION INTO THE CASE OF A DOCUMENT RELATING TO LARGE MASSES
OF VALUABLE SECURITIES GIVES US FOR THE FIRST TIME SOME INDICATION OF
A MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME
SHERLOCK HOLMESS FACE SHOWED THAT HE WAS THOROUGHLY TAKEN ABACK BY
THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT
I MUST ADMIT BOTH YOUR POINTS SAID HE I CONFESS THAT THIS
NOTEBOOK WHICH DID NOT APPEAR AT THE INQUEST MODIFIES ANY VIEWS
WHICH I MAY HAVE FORMED I HAD COME TO A THEORY OF THE CRIME IN WHICH
I CAN FIND NO PLACE FOR THIS HAVE YOU ENDEAVOURED TO TRACE ANY OF
THE SECURITIES HERE MENTIONED
INQUIRIES ARE NOW BEING MADE AT THE OFFICES BUT I FEAR THAT THE
COMPLETE REGISTER OF THE STOCKHOLDERS OF THESE SOUTH AMERICAN
CONCERNS IS IN SOUTH AMERICA AND THAT SOME WEEKS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE
WE CAN TRACE THE SHARES
HOLMES HAD BEEN EXAMINING THE COVER OF THE NOTEBOOK WITH HIS
MAGNIFYING LENS
SURELY THERE IS SOME DISCOLOURATION HERE SAID HE
YES SIR IT IS A BLOODSTAIN I TOLD YOU THAT I PICKED THE BOOK OFF
THE FLOOR
WAS THE BLOODSTAIN ABOVE OR BELOW
ON THE SIDE NEXT THE BOARDS
WHICH PROVES OF COURSE THAT THE BOOK WAS DROPPED AFTER THE CRIME
WAS COMMITTED
EXACTLY MR HOLMES I APPRECIATED THAT POINT AND I CONJECTURED
THAT IT WAS DROPPED BY THE MURDERER IN HIS HURRIED FLIGHT IT LAY
NEAR THE DOOR
I SUPPOSE THAT NONE OF THESE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN FOUND AMONG THE
PROPERTY OF THE DEAD MAN
NO SIR
HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO SUSPECT ROBBERY
NO SIR NOTHING SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN TOUCHED
DEAR ME IT IS CERTAINLY A VERY INTERESTING CASE THEN THERE WAS A
KNIFE WAS THERE NOT
A SHEATHKNIFE STILL IN ITS SHEATH IT LAY AT THE FEET OF THE DEAD
MAN MRS CAREY HAS IDENTIFIED IT AS BEING HER HUSBANDS PROPERTY
HOLMES WAS LOST IN THOUGHT FOR SOME TIME
WELL SAID HE AT LAST I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO COME OUT AND
HAVE A LOOK AT IT
STANLEY HOPKINS GAVE A CRY OF JOY
THANK YOU SIR THAT WILL INDEED BE A WEIGHT OFF MY MIND
HOLMES SHOOK HIS FINGER AT THE INSPECTOR
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EASIER TASK A WEEK AGO SAID HE BUT EVEN
NOW MY VISIT MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY FRUITLESS WATSON IF YOU CAN SPARE
THE TIME I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD OF YOUR COMPANY IF YOU WILL CALL A
FOURWHEELER HOPKINS WE SHALL BE READY TO START FOR FOREST ROW IN A
QUARTER OF AN HOUR
ALIGHTING AT THE SMALL WAYSIDE STATION WE DROVE FOR SOME MILES
THROUGH THE REMAINS OF WIDESPREAD WOODS WHICH WERE ONCE PART OF THAT
GREAT FOREST WHICH FOR SO LONG HELD THE SAXON INVADERS AT BAYTHE
IMPENETRABLE WEALD FOR SIXTY YEARS THE BULWARK OF BRITAIN VAST
SECTIONS OF IT HAVE BEEN CLEARED FOR THIS IS THE SEAT OF THE FIRST
IRONWORKS OF THE COUNTRY AND THE TREES HAVE BEEN FELLED TO SMELT
THE ORE NOW THE RICHER FIELDS OF THE NORTH HAVE ABSORBED THE TRADE
AND NOTHING SAVE THESE RAVAGED GROVES AND GREAT SCARS IN THE EARTH
SHOW THE WORK OF THE PAST HERE IN A CLEARING UPON THE GREEN SLOPE OF
A HILL STOOD A LONG LOW STONE HOUSE APPROACHED BY A CURVING DRIVE
RUNNING THROUGH THE FIELDS NEARER THE ROAD AND SURROUNDED ON THREE
SIDES BY BUSHES WAS A SMALL OUTHOUSE ONE WINDOW AND THE DOOR FACING
IN OUR DIRECTION IT WAS THE SCENE OF THE MURDER
STANLEY HOPKINS LED US FIRST TO THE HOUSE WHERE HE INTRODUCED US TO
A HAGGARD GREYHAIRED WOMAN THE WIDOW OF THE MURDERED MAN WHOSE
GAUNT AND DEEPLINED FACE WITH THE FURTIVE LOOK OF TERROR IN THE
DEPTHS OF HER REDRIMMED EYES TOLD OF THE YEARS OF HARDSHIP AND
ILLUSAGE WHICH SHE HAD ENDURED WITH HER WAS HER DAUGHTER A PALE
FAIRHAIRED GIRL WHOSE EYES BLAZED DEFIANTLY AT US AS SHE TOLD US
THAT SHE WAS GLAD THAT HER FATHER WAS DEAD AND THAT SHE BLESSED THE
HAND WHICH HAD STRUCK HIM DOWN IT WAS A TERRIBLE HOUSEHOLD THAT
BLACK PETER CAREY HAD MADE FOR HIMSELF AND IT WAS WITH A SENSE OF
RELIEF THAT WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE SUNLIGHT AGAIN AND MAKING OUR
WAY ALONG A PATH WHICH HAD BEEN WORN ACROSS THE FIELDS BY THE FEET OF
THE DEAD MAN
THE OUTHOUSE WAS THE SIMPLEST OF DWELLINGS WOODENWALLED
SHINGLEROOFED ONE WINDOW BESIDE THE DOOR AND ONE ON THE FARTHER
SIDE STANLEY HOPKINS DREW THE KEY FROM HIS POCKET AND HAD STOOPED
TO THE LOCK WHEN HE PAUSED WITH A LOOK OF ATTENTION AND SURPRISE
UPON HIS FACE
SOMEONE HAS BEEN TAMPERING WITH IT HE SAID
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF THE FACT THE WOODWORK WAS CUT AND THE
SCRATCHES SHOWED WHITE THROUGH THE PAINT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THAT
INSTANT DONE HOLMES HAD BEEN EXAMINING THE WINDOW
SOMEONE HAS TRIED TO FORCE THIS ALSO WHOEVER IT WAS HAS FAILED TO
MAKE HIS WAY IN HE MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY POOR BURGLAR
THIS IS A MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING SAID THE INSPECTOR I COULD
SWEAR THAT THESE MARKS WERE NOT HERE YESTERDAY EVENING
SOME CURIOUS PERSON FROM THE VILLAGE PERHAPS I SUGGESTED
VERY UNLIKELY FEW OF THEM WOULD DARE TO SET FOOT IN THE GROUNDS
FAR LESS TRY TO FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE CABIN WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
IT MR HOLMES
I THINK THAT FORTUNE IS VERY KIND TO US
YOU MEAN THAT THE PERSON WILL COME AGAIN
IT IS VERY PROBABLE HE CAME EXPECTING TO FIND THE DOOR OPEN HE
TRIED TO GET IN WITH THE BLADE OF A VERY SMALL PENKNIFE HE COULD NOT
MANAGE IT WHAT WOULD HE DO
COME AGAIN NEXT NIGHT WITH A MORE USEFUL TOOL
SO I SHOULD SAY IT WILL BE OUR FAULT IF WE ARE NOT THERE TO RECEIVE
HIM MEANWHILE LET ME SEE THE INSIDE OF THE CABIN
THE TRACES OF THE TRAGEDY HAD BEEN REMOVED BUT THE FURNITURE WITHIN
THE LITTLE ROOM STILL STOOD AS IT HAD BEEN ON THE NIGHT OF THE CRIME
FOR TWO HOURS WITH MOST INTENSE CONCENTRATION HOLMES EXAMINED EVERY
OBJECT IN TURN BUT HIS FACE SHOWED THAT HIS QUEST WAS NOT A
SUCCESSFUL ONE ONCE ONLY HE PAUSED IN HIS PATIENT INVESTIGATION
HAVE YOU TAKEN ANYTHING OFF THIS SHELF HOPKINS
NO I HAVE MOVED NOTHING
SOMETHING HAS BEEN TAKEN THERE IS LESS DUST IN THIS CORNER OF THE
SHELF THAN ELSEWHERE IT MAY HAVE BEEN A BOOK LYING ON ITS SIDE IT
MAY HAVE BEEN A BOX WELL WELL I CAN DO NOTHING MORE LET US WALK
IN THESE BEAUTIFUL WOODS WATSON AND GIVE A FEW HOURS TO THE BIRDS
AND THE FLOWERS WE SHALL MEET YOU HERE LATER HOPKINS AND SEE IF WE
CAN COME TO CLOSER QUARTERS WITH THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS PAID THIS
VISIT IN THE NIGHT
IT WAS PAST ELEVEN OCLOCK WHEN WE FORMED OUR LITTLE AMBUSCADE
HOPKINS WAS FOR LEAVING THE DOOR OF THE HUT OPEN BUT HOLMES WAS OF
THE OPINION THAT THIS WOULD ROUSE THE SUSPICIONS OF THE STRANGER THE
LOCK WAS A PERFECTLY SIMPLE ONE AND ONLY A STRONG BLADE WAS NEEDED
TO PUSH IT BACK HOLMES ALSO SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD WAIT NOT
INSIDE THE HUT BUT OUTSIDE IT AMONG THE BUSHES WHICH GREW ROUND THE
FARTHER WINDOW IN THIS WAY WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO WATCH OUR MAN IF HE
STRUCK A LIGHT AND SEE WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS IN THIS STEALTHY
NOCTURNAL VISIT
IT WAS A LONG AND MELANCHOLY VIGIL AND YET BROUGHT WITH IT SOMETHING
OF THE THRILL WHICH THE HUNTER FEELS WHEN HE LIES BESIDE THE WATER
POOL AND WAITS FOR THE COMING OF THE THIRSTY BEAST OF PREY WHAT
SAVAGE CREATURE WAS IT WHICH MIGHT STEAL UPON US OUT OF THE DARKNESS
WAS IT A FIERCE TIGER OF CRIME WHICH COULD ONLY BE TAKEN FIGHTING
HARD WITH FLASHING FANG AND CLAW OR WOULD IT PROVE TO BE SOME
SKULKING JACKAL DANGEROUS ONLY TO THE WEAK AND UNGUARDED
IN ABSOLUTE SILENCE WE CROUCHED AMONGST THE BUSHES WAITING FOR
WHATEVER MIGHT COME AT FIRST THE STEPS OF A FEW BELATED VILLAGERS
OR THE SOUND OF VOICES FROM THE VILLAGE LIGHTENED OUR VIGIL BUT ONE
BY ONE THESE INTERRUPTIONS DIED AWAY AND AN ABSOLUTE STILLNESS FELL
UPON US SAVE FOR THE CHIMES OF THE DISTANT CHURCH WHICH TOLD US OF
THE PROGRESS OF THE NIGHT AND FOR THE RUSTLE AND WHISPER OF A FINE
RAIN FALLING AMID THE FOLIAGE WHICH ROOFED US IN
HALFPAST TWO HAD CHIMED AND IT WAS THE DARKEST HOUR WHICH PRECEDES
THE DAWN WHEN WE ALL STARTED AS A LOW BUT SHARP CLICK CAME FROM THE
DIRECTION OF THE GATE SOMEONE HAD ENTERED THE DRIVE AGAIN THERE WAS
A LONG SILENCE AND I HAD BEGUN TO FEAR THAT IT WAS A FALSE ALARM
WHEN A STEALTHY STEP WAS HEARD UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HUT AND A
MOMENT LATER A METALLIC SCRAPING AND CLINKING THE MAN WAS TRYING TO
FORCE THE LOCK THIS TIME HIS SKILL WAS GREATER OR HIS TOOL WAS
BETTER FOR THERE WAS A SUDDEN SNAP AND THE CREAK OF THE HINGES THEN
A MATCH WAS STRUCK AND NEXT INSTANT THE STEADY LIGHT FROM A CANDLE
FILLED THE INTERIOR OF THE HUT THROUGH THE GAUZE CURTAIN OUR EYES
WERE ALL RIVETED UPON THE SCENE WITHIN
THE NOCTURNAL VISITOR WAS A YOUNG MAN FRAIL AND THIN WITH A BLACK
MOUSTACHE WHICH INTENSIFIED THE DEADLY PALLOR OF HIS FACE HE COULD
NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH ABOVE TWENTY YEARS OF AGE I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY
HUMAN BEING WHO APPEARED TO BE IN SUCH A PITIABLE FRIGHT FOR HIS
TEETH WERE VISIBLY CHATTERING AND HE WAS SHAKING IN EVERY LIMB HE
WAS DRESSED LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN NORFOLK JACKET AND KNICKERBOCKERS
WITH A CLOTH CAP UPON HIS HEAD WE WATCHED HIM STARING ROUND WITH
FRIGHTENED EYES THEN HE LAID THE CANDLEEND UPON THE TABLE AND
DISAPPEARED FROM OUR VIEW INTO ONE OF THE CORNERS HE RETURNED WITH A
LARGE BOOK ONE OF THE LOGBOOKS WHICH FORMED A LINE UPON THE
SHELVES LEANING ON THE TABLE HE RAPIDLY TURNED OVER THE LEAVES OF
THIS VOLUME UNTIL HE CAME TO THE ENTRY WHICH HE SOUGHT THEN WITH AN
ANGRY GESTURE OF HIS CLENCHED HAND HE CLOSED THE BOOK REPLACED IT
IN THE CORNER AND PUT OUT THE LIGHT HE HAD HARDLY TURNED TO LEAVE
THE HUT WHEN HOPKINSS HAND WAS ON THE FELLOWS COLLAR AND I HEARD
HIS LOUD GASP OF TERROR AS HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS TAKEN THE
CANDLE WAS RELIT AND THERE WAS OUR WRETCHED CAPTIVE SHIVERING AND
COWERING IN THE GRASP OF THE DETECTIVE HE SANK DOWN UPON THE
SEACHEST AND LOOKED HELPLESSLY FROM ONE OF US TO THE OTHER
NOW MY FINE FELLOW SAID STANLEY HOPKINS WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT
DO YOU WANT HERE
THE MAN PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER AND FACED US WITH AN EFFORT AT
SELFCOMPOSURE
YOU ARE DETECTIVES I SUPPOSE SAID HE YOU IMAGINE I AM CONNECTED
WITH THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN PETER CAREY I ASSURE YOU THAT I AM
INNOCENT
WELL SEE ABOUT THAT SAID HOPKINS FIRST OF ALL WHAT IS YOUR
NAME
IT IS JOHN HOPLEY NELIGAN
I SAW HOLMES AND HOPKINS EXCHANGE A QUICK GLANCE
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
CAN I SPEAK CONFIDENTIALLY
NO CERTAINLY NOT
WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU
IF YOU HAVE NO ANSWER IT MAY GO BADLY WITH YOU AT THE TRIAL
THE YOUNG MAN WINCED
WELL I WILL TELL YOU HE SAID WHY SHOULD I NOT AND YET I HATE
TO THINK OF THIS OLD SCANDAL GAINING A NEW LEASE OF LIFE DID YOU
EVER HEAR OF DAWSON AND NELIGAN
I COULD SEE FROM HOPKINSS FACE THAT HE NEVER HAD BUT HOLMES WAS
KEENLY INTERESTED
YOU MEAN THE WESTCOUNTRY BANKERS SAID HE THEY FAILED FOR A
MILLION RUINED HALF THE COUNTY FAMILIES OF CORNWALL AND NELIGAN
DISAPPEARED
EXACTLY NELIGAN WAS MY FATHER
AT LAST WE WERE GETTING SOMETHING POSITIVE AND YET IT SEEMED A LONG
GAP BETWEEN AN ABSCONDING BANKER AND CAPTAIN PETER CAREY PINNED
AGAINST THE WALL WITH ONE OF HIS OWN HARPOONS WE ALL LISTENED
INTENTLY TO THE YOUNG MANS WORDS
IT WAS MY FATHER WHO WAS REALLY CONCERNED DAWSON HAD RETIRED I WAS
ONLY TEN YEARS OF AGE AT THE TIME BUT I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO FEEL THE
SHAME AND HORROR OF IT ALL IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN SAID THAT MY FATHER
STOLE ALL THE SECURITIES AND FLED IT IS NOT TRUE IT WAS HIS BELIEF
THAT IF HE WERE GIVEN TIME IN WHICH TO REALIZE THEM ALL WOULD BE WELL
AND EVERY CREDITOR PAID IN FULL HE STARTED IN HIS LITTLE YACHT FOR
NORWAY JUST BEFORE THE WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR HIS ARREST I CAN
REMEMBER THAT LAST NIGHT WHEN HE BADE FAREWELL TO MY MOTHER HE LEFT
US A LIST OF THE SECURITIES HE WAS TAKING AND HE SWORE THAT HE WOULD
COME BACK WITH HIS HONOUR CLEARED AND THAT NONE WHO HAD TRUSTED HIM
WOULD SUFFER WELL NO WORD WAS EVER HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN BOTH THE
YACHT AND HE VANISHED UTTERLY WE BELIEVED MY MOTHER AND I THAT HE
AND IT WITH THE SECURITIES THAT HE HAD TAKEN WITH HIM WERE AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE SEA WE HAD A FAITHFUL FRIEND HOWEVER WHO IS A
BUSINESS MAN AND IT WAS HE WHO DISCOVERED SOME TIME AGO THAT SOME OF
THE SECURITIES WHICH MY FATHER HAD WITH HIM HAVE REAPPEARED ON THE
LONDON MARKET YOU CAN IMAGINE OUR AMAZEMENT I SPENT MONTHS IN
TRYING TO TRACE THEM AND AT LAST AFTER MANY DOUBLINGS AND
DIFFICULTIES I DISCOVERED THAT THE ORIGINAL SELLER HAD BEEN CAPTAIN
PETER CAREY THE OWNER OF THIS HUT
NATURALLY I MADE SOME INQUIRIES ABOUT THE MAN I FOUND THAT HE HAD
BEEN IN COMMAND OF A WHALER WHICH WAS DUE TO RETURN FROM THE ARCTIC
SEAS AT THE VERY TIME WHEN MY FATHER WAS CROSSING TO NORWAY THE
AUTUMN OF THAT YEAR WAS A STORMY ONE AND THERE WAS A LONG SUCCESSION
OF SOUTHERLY GALES MY FATHERS YACHT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN BLOWN TO THE
NORTH AND THERE MET BY CAPTAIN PETER CAREYS SHIP IF THAT WERE SO
WHAT HAD BECOME OF MY FATHER IN ANY CASE IF I COULD PROVE FROM
PETER CAREYS EVIDENCE HOW THESE SECURITIES CAME ON THE MARKET IT
WOULD BE A PROOF THAT MY FATHER HAD NOT SOLD THEM AND THAT HE HAD NO
VIEW TO PERSONAL PROFIT WHEN HE TOOK THEM
I CAME DOWN TO SUSSEX WITH THE INTENTION OF SEEING THE CAPTAIN BUT
IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT HIS TERRIBLE DEATH OCCURRED I READ AT THE
INQUEST A DESCRIPTION OF HIS CABIN IN WHICH IT STATED THAT THE OLD
LOGBOOKS OF HIS VESSEL WERE PRESERVED IN IT IT STRUCK ME THAT IF I
COULD SEE WHAT OCCURRED IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST ON BOARD THE
SEA UNICORN I MIGHT SETTLE THE MYSTERY OF MY FATHERS FATE I TRIED
LAST NIGHT TO GET AT THESE LOGBOOKS BUT WAS UNABLE TO OPEN THE
DOOR TONIGHT I TRIED AGAIN AND SUCCEEDED BUT I FIND THAT THE
PAGES WHICH DEAL WITH THAT MONTH HAVE BEEN TORN FROM THE BOOK IT WAS
AT THAT MOMENT I FOUND MYSELF A PRISONER IN YOUR HANDS
IS THAT ALL ASKED HOPKINS
YES THAT IS ALL HIS EYES SHIFTED AS HE SAID IT
YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO TELL US
HE HESITATED
NO THERE IS NOTHING
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN HERE BEFORE LAST NIGHT
NO
THEN HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT CRIED HOPKINS AS HE HELD UP THE
DAMNING NOTEBOOK WITH THE INITIALS OF OUR PRISONER ON THE FIRST
LEAF AND THE BLOODSTAIN ON THE COVER
THE WRETCHED MAN COLLAPSED HE SANK HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS AND
TREMBLED ALL OVER
WHERE DID YOU GET IT HE GROANED I DID NOT KNOW I THOUGHT I HAD
LOST IT AT THE HOTEL
THAT IS ENOUGH SAID HOPKINS STERNLY WHATEVER ELSE YOU HAVE TO
SAY YOU MUST SAY IN COURT YOU WILL WALK DOWN WITH ME NOW TO THE
POLICESTATION WELL MR HOLMES I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU AND
TO YOUR FRIEND FOR COMING DOWN TO HELP ME AS IT TURNS OUT YOUR
PRESENCE WAS UNNECESSARY AND I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE CASE TO THIS
SUCCESSFUL ISSUE WITHOUT YOU BUT NONE THE LESS I AM VERY GRATEFUL
ROOMS HAVE BEEN RESERVED FOR YOU AT THE BRAMBLETYE HOTEL SO WE CAN
ALL WALK DOWN TO THE VILLAGE TOGETHER
WELL WATSON WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT ASKED HOLMES AS WE
TRAVELLED BACK NEXT MORNING
I CAN SEE THAT YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED
OH YES MY DEAR WATSON I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED AT THE SAME TIME
STANLEY HOPKINSS METHODS DO NOT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO ME I AM
DISAPPOINTED IN STANLEY HOPKINS I HAD HOPED FOR BETTER THINGS FROM
HIM ONE SHOULD ALWAYS LOOK FOR A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE AND PROVIDE
AGAINST IT IT IS THE FIRST RULE OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
WHAT THEN IS THE ALTERNATIVE
THE LINE OF INVESTIGATION WHICH I HAVE MYSELF BEEN PURSUING IT MAY
GIVE US NOTHING I CANNOT TELL BUT AT LEAST I SHALL FOLLOW IT TO THE
END
SEVERAL LETTERS WERE WAITING FOR HOLMES AT BAKER STREET HE SNATCHED
ONE OF THEM UP OPENED IT AND BURST OUT INTO A TRIUMPHANT CHUCKLE OF
LAUGHTER
EXCELLENT WATSON THE ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPS HAVE YOU TELEGRAPH
FORMS JUST WRITE A COUPLE OF MESSAGES FOR ME SUMNER SHIPPING
AGENT RATCLIFF HIGHWAY SEND THREE MEN ON TO ARRIVE TEN TOMORROW
MORNINGBASIL THATS MY NAME IN THOSE PARTS THE OTHER IS
INSPECTOR STANLEY HOPKINS LORD STREET BRIXTON COME BREAKFAST
TOMORROW AT NINETHIRTY IMPORTANT WIRE IF UNABLE TO
COMESHERLOCK HOLMES THERE WATSON THIS INFERNAL CASE HAS
HAUNTED ME FOR TEN DAYS I HEREBY BANISH IT COMPLETELY FROM MY
PRESENCE TOMORROW I TRUST THAT WE SHALL HEAR THE LAST OF IT FOR
EVER
SHARP AT THE HOUR NAMED INSPECTOR STANLEY HOPKINS APPEARED AND WE
SAT DOWN TOGETHER TO THE EXCELLENT BREAKFAST WHICH MRS HUDSON HAD
PREPARED THE YOUNG DETECTIVE WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS AT HIS SUCCESS
YOU REALLY THINK THAT YOUR SOLUTION MUST BE CORRECT ASKED HOLMES
I COULD NOT IMAGINE A MORE COMPLETE CASE
IT DID NOT SEEM TO ME CONCLUSIVE
YOU ASTONISH ME MR HOLMES WHAT MORE COULD ONE ASK FOR
DOES YOUR EXPLANATION COVER EVERY POINT
UNDOUBTEDLY I FIND THAT YOUNG NELIGAN ARRIVED AT THE BRAMBLETYE
HOTEL ON THE VERY DAY OF THE CRIME HE CAME ON THE PRETENCE OF
PLAYING GOLF HIS ROOM WAS ON THE GROUNDFLOOR AND HE COULD GET OUT
WHEN HE LIKED THAT VERY NIGHT HE WENT DOWN TO WOODMANS LEE SAW
PETER CAREY AT THE HUT QUARRELLED WITH HIM AND KILLED HIM WITH THE
HARPOON THEN HORRIFIED BY WHAT HE HAD DONE HE FLED OUT OF THE HUT
DROPPING THE NOTEBOOK WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM IN ORDER TO
QUESTION PETER CAREY ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT SECURITIES YOU MAY HAVE
OBSERVED THAT SOME OF THEM WERE MARKED WITH TICKS AND THE
OTHERSTHE GREAT MAJORITYWERE NOT THOSE WHICH ARE TICKED HAVE
BEEN TRACED ON THE LONDON MARKET BUT THE OTHERS PRESUMABLY WERE
STILL IN THE POSSESSION OF CAREY AND YOUNG NELIGAN ACCORDING TO HIS
OWN ACCOUNT WAS ANXIOUS TO RECOVER THEM IN ORDER TO DO THE RIGHT
THING BY HIS FATHERS CREDITORS AFTER HIS FLIGHT HE DID NOT DARE TO
APPROACH THE HUT AGAIN FOR SOME TIME BUT AT LAST HE FORCED HIMSELF
TO DO SO IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE INFORMATION WHICH HE NEEDED SURELY
THAT IS ALL SIMPLE AND OBVIOUS
HOLMES SMILED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
IT SEEMS TO ME TO HAVE ONLY ONE DRAWBACK HOPKINS AND THAT IS THAT
IT IS INTRINSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE HAVE YOU TRIED TO DRIVE A HARPOON
THROUGH A BODY NO TUT TUT MY DEAR SIR YOU MUST REALLY PAY
ATTENTION TO THESE DETAILS MY FRIEND WATSON COULD TELL YOU THAT I
SPENT A WHOLE MORNING IN THAT EXERCISE IT IS NO EASY MATTER AND
REQUIRES A STRONG AND PRACTISED ARM BUT THIS BLOW WAS DELIVERED WITH
SUCH VIOLENCE THAT THE HEAD OF THE WEAPON SANK DEEP INTO THE WALL DO
YOU IMAGINE THAT THIS ANAEMIC YOUTH WAS CAPABLE OF SO FRIGHTFUL AN
ASSAULT IS HE THE MAN WHO HOBNOBBED IN RUM AND WATER WITH BLACK
PETER IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT WAS IT HIS PROFILE THAT WAS SEEN ON
THE BLIND TWO NIGHTS BEFORE NO NO HOPKINS IT IS ANOTHER AND A
MORE FORMIDABLE PERSON FOR WHOM WE MUST SEEK
THE DETECTIVES FACE HAD GROWN LONGER AND LONGER DURING HOLMESS
SPEECH HIS HOPES AND HIS AMBITIONS WERE ALL CRUMBLING ABOUT HIM BUT
HE WOULD NOT ABANDON HIS POSITION WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
YOU CANT DENY THAT NELIGAN WAS PRESENT THAT NIGHT MR HOLMES THE
BOOK WILL PROVE THAT I FANCY THAT I HAVE EVIDENCE ENOUGH TO SATISFY
A JURY EVEN IF YOU ARE ABLE TO PICK A HOLE IN IT BESIDES MR
HOLMES I HAVE LAID MY HAND UPON MY MAN AS TO THIS TERRIBLE PERSON
OF YOURS WHERE IS HE
I RATHER FANCY THAT HE IS ON THE STAIR SAID HOLMES SERENELY I
THINK WATSON THAT YOU WOULD DO WELL TO PUT THAT REVOLVER WHERE YOU
CAN REACH IT HE ROSE AND LAID A WRITTEN PAPER UPON A SIDETABLE
NOW WE ARE READY SAID HE
THERE HAD BEEN SOME TALKING IN GRUFF VOICES OUTSIDE AND NOW MRS
HUDSON OPENED THE DOOR TO SAY THAT THERE WERE THREE MEN INQUIRING FOR
CAPTAIN BASIL
SHOW THEM IN ONE BY ONE SAID HOLMES
THE FIRST WHO ENTERED WAS A LITTLE RIBSTONPIPPIN OF A MAN WITH
RUDDY CHEEKS AND FLUFFY WHITE SIDEWHISKERS HOLMES HAD DRAWN A
LETTER FROM HIS POCKET
WHAT NAME HE ASKED
JAMES LANCASTER
I AM SORRY LANCASTER BUT THE BERTH IS FULL HERE IS HALF A
SOVEREIGN FOR YOUR TROUBLE JUST STEP INTO THIS ROOM AND WAIT THERE
FOR A FEW MINUTES
THE SECOND MAN WAS A LONG DRIEDUP CREATURE WITH LANK HAIR AND
SALLOW CHEEKS HIS NAME WAS HUGH PATTINS HE ALSO RECEIVED HIS
DISMISSAL HIS HALFSOVEREIGN AND THE ORDER TO WAIT
THE THIRD APPLICANT WAS A MAN OF REMARKABLE APPEARANCE A FIERCE
BULLDOG FACE WAS FRAMED IN A TANGLE OF HAIR AND BEARD AND TWO BOLD
DARK EYES GLEAMED BEHIND THE COVER OF THICK TUFTED OVERHUNG
EYEBROWS HE SALUTED AND STOOD SAILORFASHION TURNING HIS CAP ROUND
IN HIS HANDS
YOUR NAME ASKED HOLMES
PATRICK CAIRNS
HARPOONER
YES SIR TWENTYSIX VOYAGES
DUNDEE I SUPPOSE
YES SIR
AND READY TO START WITH AN EXPLORING SHIP
YES SIR
WHAT WAGES
EIGHT POUNDS A MONTH
COULD YOU START AT ONCE
AS SOON AS I GET MY KIT
HAVE YOU YOUR PAPERS
YES SIR HE TOOK A SHEAF OF WORN AND GREASY FORMS FROM HIS POCKET
HOLMES GLANCED OVER THEM AND RETURNED THEM
YOU ARE JUST THE MAN I WANT SAID HE HERES THE AGREEMENT ON THE
SIDETABLE IF YOU SIGN IT THE WHOLE MATTER WILL BE SETTLED
THE SEAMAN LURCHED ACROSS THE ROOM AND TOOK UP THE PEN
SHALL I SIGN HERE HE ASKED STOOPING OVER THE TABLE
HOLMES LEANED OVER HIS SHOULDER AND PASSED BOTH HANDS OVER HIS NECK
THIS WILL DO SAID HE
I HEARD A CLICK OF STEEL AND A BELLOW LIKE AN ENRAGED BULL THE NEXT
INSTANT HOLMES AND THE SEAMAN WERE ROLLING ON THE GROUND TOGETHER HE
WAS A MAN OF SUCH GIGANTIC STRENGTH THAT EVEN WITH THE HANDCUFFS
WHICH HOLMES HAD SO DEFTLY FASTENED UPON HIS WRISTS HE WOULD HAVE
VERY QUICKLY OVERPOWERED MY FRIEND HAD HOPKINS AND I NOT RUSHED TO
HIS RESCUE ONLY WHEN I PRESSED THE COLD MUZZLE OF THE REVOLVER TO
HIS TEMPLE DID HE AT LAST UNDERSTAND THAT RESISTANCE WAS VAIN WE
LASHED HIS ANKLES WITH CORD AND ROSE BREATHLESS FROM THE STRUGGLE
I MUST REALLY APOLOGIZE HOPKINS SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES I FEAR
THAT THE SCRAMBLED EGGS ARE COLD HOWEVER YOU WILL ENJOY THE REST OF
YOUR BREAKFAST ALL THE BETTER WILL YOU NOT FOR THE THOUGHT THAT YOU
HAVE BROUGHT YOUR CASE TO A TRIUMPHANT CONCLUSION
STANLEY HOPKINS WAS SPEECHLESS WITH AMAZEMENT
I DONT KNOW WHAT TO SAY MR HOLMES HE BLURTED OUT AT LAST WITH
A VERY RED FACE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I HAVE BEEN MAKING A FOOL OF
MYSELF FROM THE BEGINNING I UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
FORGOTTEN THAT I AM THE PUPIL AND YOU ARE THE MASTER EVEN NOW I SEE
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE BUT I DONT KNOW HOW YOU DID IT OR WHAT IT
SIGNIFIES
WELL WELL SAID HOLMES GOODHUMOUREDLY WE ALL LEARN BY
EXPERIENCE AND YOUR LESSON THIS TIME IS THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER LOSE
SIGHT OF THE ALTERNATIVE YOU WERE SO ABSORBED IN YOUNG NELIGAN THAT
YOU COULD NOT SPARE A THOUGHT TO PATRICK CAIRNS THE TRUE MURDERER OF
PETER CAREY
THE HOARSE VOICE OF THE SEAMAN BROKE IN ON OUR CONVERSATION
SEE HERE MISTER SAID HE I MAKE NO COMPLAINT OF BEING
MANHANDLED IN THIS FASHION BUT I WOULD HAVE YOU CALL THINGS BY
THEIR RIGHT NAMES YOU SAY I MURDERED PETER CAREY I SAY I KILLED
PETER CAREY AND THERES ALL THE DIFFERENCE MAYBE YOU DONT BELIEVE
WHAT I SAY MAYBE YOU THINK I AM JUST SLINGING YOU A YARN
NOT AT ALL SAID HOLMES LET US HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY
ITS SOON TOLD AND BY THE LORD EVERY WORD OF IT IS TRUTH I KNEW
BLACK PETER AND WHEN HE PULLED OUT HIS KNIFE I WHIPPED A HARPOON
THROUGH HIM SHARP FOR I KNEW THAT IT WAS HIM OR ME THATS HOW HE
DIED YOU CAN CALL IT MURDER ANYHOW ID AS SOON DIE WITH A ROPE
ROUND MY NECK AS WITH BLACK PETERS KNIFE IN MY HEART
HOW CAME YOU THERE ASKED HOLMES
ILL TELL IT YOU FROM THE BEGINNING JUST SIT ME UP A LITTLE SO AS I
CAN SPEAK EASY IT WAS IN THAT IT HAPPENEDAUGUST OF THAT YEAR
PETER CAREY WAS MASTER OF THE SEA UNICORN AND I WAS SPARE HARPOONER
WE WERE COMING OUT OF THE ICEPACK ON OUR WAY HOME WITH HEAD WINDS
AND A WEEKS SOUTHERLY GALE WHEN WE PICKED UP A LITTLE CRAFT THAT
HAD BEEN BLOWN NORTH THERE WAS ONE MAN ON HERA LANDSMAN THE CREW
HAD THOUGHT SHE WOULD FOUNDER AND HAD MADE FOR THE NORWEGIAN COAST
IN THE DINGHY I GUESS THEY WERE ALL DROWNED WELL WE TOOK HIM ON
BOARD THIS MAN AND HE AND THE SKIPPER HAD SOME LONG TALKS IN THE
CABIN ALL THE BAGGAGE WE TOOK OFF WITH HIM WAS ONE TIN BOX SO FAR
AS I KNOW THE MANS NAME WAS NEVER MENTIONED AND ON THE SECOND
NIGHT HE DISAPPEARED AS IF HE HAD NEVER BEEN IT WAS GIVEN OUT THAT
HE HAD EITHER THROWN HIMSELF OVERBOARD OR FALLEN OVERBOARD IN THE
HEAVY WEATHER THAT WE WERE HAVING ONLY ONE MAN KNEW WHAT HAD
HAPPENED TO HIM AND THAT WAS ME FOR WITH MY OWN EYES I SAW THE
SKIPPER TIP UP HIS HEELS AND PUT HIM OVER THE RAIL IN THE MIDDLE
WATCH OF A DARK NIGHT TWO DAYS BEFORE WE SIGHTED THE SHETLAND
LIGHTS
WELL I KEPT MY KNOWLEDGE TO MYSELF AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT WOULD
COME OF IT WHEN WE GOT BACK TO SCOTLAND IT WAS EASILY HUSHED UP AND
NOBODY ASKED ANY QUESTIONS A STRANGER DIED BY AN ACCIDENT AND IT
WAS NOBODYS BUSINESS TO INQUIRE SHORTLY AFTER PETER CAREY GAVE UP
THE SEA AND IT WAS LONG YEARS BEFORE I COULD FIND WHERE HE WAS I
GUESSED THAT HE HAD DONE THE DEED FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT WAS IN THAT
TIN BOX AND THAT HE COULD AFFORD NOW TO PAY ME WELL FOR KEEPING MY
MOUTH SHUT
I FOUND OUT WHERE HE WAS THROUGH A SAILOR MAN THAT HAD MET HIM IN
LONDON AND DOWN I WENT TO SQUEEZE HIM THE FIRST NIGHT HE WAS
REASONABLE ENOUGH AND WAS READY TO GIVE ME WHAT WOULD MAKE ME FREE
OF THE SEA FOR LIFE WE WERE TO FIX IT ALL TWO NIGHTS LATER WHEN I
CAME I FOUND HIM THREE PARTS DRUNK AND IN A VILE TEMPER WE SAT DOWN
AND WE DRANK AND WE YARNED ABOUT OLD TIMES BUT THE MORE HE DRANK THE
LESS I LIKED THE LOOK ON HIS FACE I SPOTTED THAT HARPOON UPON THE
WALL AND I THOUGHT I MIGHT NEED IT BEFORE I WAS THROUGH THEN AT
LAST HE BROKE OUT AT ME SPITTING AND CURSING WITH MURDER IN HIS
EYES AND A GREAT CLASPKNIFE IN HIS HAND HE HAD NOT TIME TO GET IT
FROM THE SHEATH BEFORE I HAD THE HARPOON THROUGH HIM HEAVENS WHAT A
YELL HE GAVE AND HIS FACE GETS BETWEEN ME AND MY SLEEP I STOOD
THERE WITH HIS BLOOD SPLASHING ROUND ME AND I WAITED FOR A BIT BUT
ALL WAS QUIET SO I TOOK HEART ONCE MORE I LOOKED ROUND AND THERE
WAS THE TIN BOX ON A SHELF I HAD AS MUCH RIGHT TO IT AS PETER CAREY
ANYHOW SO I TOOK IT WITH ME AND LEFT THE HUT LIKE A FOOL I LEFT MY
BACCYPOUCH UPON THE TABLE
NOW ILL TELL YOU THE QUEEREST PART OF THE WHOLE STORY I HAD HARDLY
GOT OUTSIDE THE HUT WHEN I HEARD SOMEONE COMING AND I HID AMONG THE
BUSHES A MAN CAME SLINKING ALONG WENT INTO THE HUT GAVE A CRY AS
IF HE HAD SEEN A GHOST AND LEGGED IT AS HARD AS HE COULD RUN UNTIL
HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT WHO HE WAS OR WHAT HE WANTED IS MORE THAN I CAN
TELL FOR MY PART I WALKED TEN MILES GOT A TRAIN AT TUNBRIDGE WELLS
AND SO REACHED LONDON AND NO ONE THE WISER
WELL WHEN I CAME TO EXAMINE THE BOX I FOUND THERE WAS NO MONEY IN
IT AND NOTHING BUT PAPERS THAT I WOULD NOT DARE TO SELL I HAD LOST
MY HOLD ON BLACK PETER AND WAS STRANDED IN LONDON WITHOUT A
SHILLING THERE WAS ONLY MY TRADE LEFT I SAW THESE ADVERTISEMENTS
ABOUT HARPOONERS AND HIGH WAGES SO I WENT TO THE SHIPPING AGENTS
AND THEY SENT ME HERE THATS ALL I KNOW AND I SAY AGAIN THAT IF I
KILLED BLACK PETER THE LAW SHOULD GIVE ME THANKS FOR I SAVED THEM
THE PRICE OF A HEMPEN ROPE
A VERY CLEAR STATEMENT SAID HOLMES RISING AND LIGHTING HIS PIPE
I THINK HOPKINS THAT YOU SHOULD LOSE NO TIME IN CONVEYING YOUR
PRISONER TO A PLACE OF SAFETY THIS ROOM IS NOT WELL ADAPTED FOR A
CELL AND MR PATRICK CAIRNS OCCUPIES TOO LARGE A PROPORTION OF OUR
CARPET
MR HOLMES SAID HOPKINS I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS MY
GRATITUDE EVEN NOW I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU ATTAINED THIS
RESULT
SIMPLY BY HAVING THE GOOD FORTUNE TO GET THE RIGHT CLUE FROM THE
BEGINNING IT IS VERY POSSIBLE IF I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS NOTEBOOK IT
MIGHT HAVE LED AWAY MY THOUGHTS AS IT DID YOURS BUT ALL I HEARD
POINTED IN THE ONE DIRECTION THE AMAZING STRENGTH THE SKILL IN THE
USE OF THE HARPOON THE RUM AND WATER THE SEALSKIN TOBACCOPOUCH
WITH THE COARSE TOBACCOALL THESE POINTED TO A SEAMAN AND ONE WHO
HAD BEEN A WHALER I WAS CONVINCED THAT THE INITIALS PC UPON THE
POUCH WERE A COINCIDENCE AND NOT THOSE OF PETER CAREY SINCE HE
SELDOM SMOKED AND NO PIPE WAS FOUND IN HIS CABIN YOU REMEMBER THAT
I ASKED WHETHER WHISKY AND BRANDY WERE IN THE CABIN YOU SAID THEY
WERE HOW MANY LANDSMEN ARE THERE WHO WOULD DRINK RUM WHEN THEY COULD
GET THESE OTHER SPIRITS YES I WAS CERTAIN IT WAS A SEAMAN
AND HOW DID YOU FIND HIM
MY DEAR SIR THE PROBLEM HAD BECOME A VERY SIMPLE ONE IF IT WERE A
SEAMAN IT COULD ONLY BE A SEAMAN WHO HAD BEEN WITH HIM ON THE SEA
UNICORN SO FAR AS I COULD LEARN HE HAD SAILED IN NO OTHER SHIP I
SPENT THREE DAYS IN WIRING TO DUNDEE AND AT THE END OF THAT TIME I
HAD ASCERTAINED THE NAMES OF THE CREW OF THE SEA UNICORN IN WHEN I
FOUND PATRICK CAIRNS AMONG THE HARPOONERS MY RESEARCH WAS
NEARING ITS END I ARGUED THAT THE MAN WAS PROBABLY IN LONDON AND
THAT HE WOULD DESIRE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY FOR A TIME I THEREFORE
SPENT SOME DAYS IN THE EASTEND DEVISED AN ARCTIC EXPEDITION PUT
FORTH TEMPTING TERMS FOR HARPOONERS WHO WOULD SERVE UNDER CAPTAIN
BASILAND BEHOLD THE RESULT
WONDERFUL CRIED HOPKINS WONDERFUL
YOU MUST OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF YOUNG NELIGAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
SAID HOLMES I CONFESS THAT I THINK YOU OWE HIM SOME APOLOGY THE
TIN BOX MUST BE RETURNED TO HIM BUT OF COURSE THE SECURITIES WHICH
PETER CAREY HAS SOLD ARE LOST FOR EVER THERES THE CAB HOPKINS AND
YOU CAN REMOVE YOUR MAN IF YOU WANT ME FOR THE TRIAL MY ADDRESS AND
THAT OF WATSON WILL BE SOMEWHERE IN NORWAYILL SEND PARTICULARS
LATER
THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON
IT IS YEARS SINCE THE INCIDENTS OF WHICH I SPEAK TOOK PLACE AND YET
IT IS WITH DIFFIDENCE THAT I ALLUDE TO THEM FOR A LONG TIME EVEN
WITH THE UTMOST DISCRETION AND RETICENCE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THE FACTS PUBLIC BUT NOW THE PRINCIPAL PERSON
CONCERNED IS BEYOND THE REACH OF HUMAN LAW AND WITH DUE SUPPRESSION
THE STORY MAY BE TOLD IN SUCH FASHION AS TO INJURE NO ONE IT RECORDS
AN ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE EXPERIENCE IN THE CAREER BOTH OF MR SHERLOCK
HOLMES AND OF MYSELF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME IF I CONCEAL THE DATE
OR ANY OTHER FACT BY WHICH HE MIGHT TRACE THE ACTUAL OCCURRENCE
WE HAD BEEN OUT FOR ONE OF OUR EVENING RAMBLES HOLMES AND I AND HAD
RETURNED ABOUT SIX OCLOCK ON A COLD FROSTY WINTERS EVENING AS
HOLMES TURNED UP THE LAMP THE LIGHT FELL UPON A CARD ON THE TABLE HE
GLANCED AT IT AND THEN WITH AN EJACULATION OF DISGUST THREW IT ON
THE FLOOR I PICKED IT UP AND READ
CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON
APPLEDORE TOWERS
HAMPSTEAD
AGENT
WHO IS HE I ASKED
THE WORST MAN IN LONDON HOLMES ANSWERED AS HE SAT DOWN AND
STRETCHED HIS LEGS BEFORE THE FIRE IS ANYTHING ON THE BACK OF THE
CARD
I TURNED IT OVER
WILL CALL AT CAM I READ
HUM HES ABOUT DUE DO YOU FEEL A CREEPING SHRINKING SENSATION
WATSON WHEN YOU STAND BEFORE THE SERPENTS IN THE ZOO AND SEE THE
SLITHERY GLIDING VENOMOUS CREATURES WITH THEIR DEADLY EYES AND
WICKED FLATTENED FACES WELL THATS HOW MILVERTON IMPRESSES ME
IVE HAD TO DO WITH FIFTY MURDERERS IN MY CAREER BUT THE WORST OF
THEM NEVER GAVE ME THE REPULSION WHICH I HAVE FOR THIS FELLOW AND
YET I CANT GET OUT OF DOING BUSINESS WITH HIMINDEED HE IS HERE AT
MY INVITATION
BUT WHO IS HE
ILL TELL YOU WATSON HE IS THE KING OF ALL THE BLACKMAILERS
HEAVEN HELP THE MAN AND STILL MORE THE WOMAN WHOSE SECRET AND
REPUTATION COME INTO THE POWER OF MILVERTON WITH A SMILING FACE AND
A HEART OF MARBLE HE WILL SQUEEZE AND SQUEEZE UNTIL HE HAS DRAINED
THEM DRY THE FELLOW IS A GENIUS IN HIS WAY AND WOULD HAVE MADE HIS
MARK IN SOME MORE SAVOURY TRADE HIS METHOD IS AS FOLLOWS HE ALLOWS
IT TO BE KNOWN THAT HE IS PREPARED TO PAY VERY HIGH SUMS FOR LETTERS
WHICH COMPROMISE PEOPLE OF WEALTH OR POSITION HE RECEIVES THESE
WARES NOT ONLY FROM TREACHEROUS VALETS OR MAIDS BUT FREQUENTLY FROM
GENTEEL RUFFIANS WHO HAVE GAINED THE CONFIDENCE AND AFFECTION OF
TRUSTING WOMEN HE DEALS WITH NO NIGGARD HAND I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT
HE PAID SEVEN HUNDRED POUNDS TO A FOOTMAN FOR A NOTE TWO LINES IN
LENGTH AND THAT THE RUIN OF A NOBLE FAMILY WAS THE RESULT
EVERYTHING WHICH IS IN THE MARKET GOES TO MILVERTON AND THERE ARE
HUNDREDS IN THIS GREAT CITY WHO TURN WHITE AT HIS NAME NO ONE KNOWS
WHERE HIS GRIP MAY FALL FOR HE IS FAR TOO RICH AND FAR TOO CUNNING
TO WORK FROM HAND TO MOUTH HE WILL HOLD A CARD BACK FOR YEARS IN
ORDER TO PLAY IT AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE STAKE IS BEST WORTH WINNING
I HAVE SAID THAT HE IS THE WORST MAN IN LONDON AND I WOULD ASK YOU
HOW COULD ONE COMPARE THE RUFFIAN WHO IN HOT BLOOD BLUDGEONS HIS MATE
WITH THIS MAN WHO METHODICALLY AND AT HIS LEISURE TORTURES THE SOUL
AND WRINGS THE NERVES IN ORDER TO ADD TO HIS ALREADY SWOLLEN
MONEYBAGS
I HAD SELDOM HEARD MY FRIEND SPEAK WITH SUCH INTENSITY OF FEELING
BUT SURELY SAID I THE FELLOW MUST BE WITHIN THE GRASP OF THE
LAW
TECHNICALLY NO DOUBT BUT PRACTICALLY NOT WHAT WOULD IT PROFIT A
WOMAN FOR EXAMPLE TO GET HIM A FEW MONTHS IMPRISONMENT IF HER OWN
RUIN MUST IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW HIS VICTIMS DARE NOT HIT BACK IF EVER
HE BLACKMAILED AN INNOCENT PERSON THEN INDEED WE SHOULD HAVE HIM
BUT HE IS AS CUNNING AS THE EVIL ONE NO NO WE MUST FIND OTHER WAYS
TO FIGHT HIM
AND WHY IS HE HERE
BECAUSE AN ILLUSTRIOUS CLIENT HAS PLACED HER PITEOUS CASE IN MY
HANDS IT IS THE LADY EVA BRACKWELL THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DEBUTANTE OF
LAST SEASON SHE IS TO BE MARRIED IN A FORTNIGHT TO THE EARL OF
DOVERCOURT THIS FIEND HAS SEVERAL IMPRUDENT LETTERSIMPRUDENT
WATSON NOTHING WORSEWHICH WERE WRITTEN TO AN IMPECUNIOUS YOUNG
SQUIRE IN THE COUNTRY THEY WOULD SUFFICE TO BREAK OFF THE MATCH
MILVERTON WILL SEND THE LETTERS TO THE EARL UNLESS A LARGE SUM OF
MONEY IS PAID HIM I HAVE BEEN COMMISSIONED TO MEET HIM ANDTO MAKE
THE BEST TERMS I CAN
AT THAT INSTANT THERE WAS A CLATTER AND A RATTLE IN THE STREET BELOW
LOOKING DOWN I SAW A STATELY CARRIAGE AND PAIR THE BRILLIANT LAMPS
GLEAMING ON THE GLOSSY HAUNCHES OF THE NOBLE CHESTNUTS A FOOTMAN
OPENED THE DOOR AND A SMALL STOUT MAN IN A SHAGGY ASTRACHAN
OVERCOAT DESCENDED A MINUTE LATER HE WAS IN THE ROOM
CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON WAS A MAN OF FIFTY WITH A LARGE
INTELLECTUAL HEAD A ROUND PLUMP HAIRLESS FACE A PERPETUAL FROZEN
SMILE AND TWO KEEN GREY EYES WHICH GLEAMED BRIGHTLY FROM BEHIND
BROAD GOLDENRIMMED GLASSES THERE WAS SOMETHING OF MR PICKWICKS
BENEVOLENCE IN HIS APPEARANCE MARRED ONLY BY THE INSINCERITY OF THE
FIXED SMILE AND BY THE HARD GLITTER OF THOSE RESTLESS AND PENETRATING
EYES HIS VOICE WAS AS SMOOTH AND SUAVE AS HIS COUNTENANCE AS HE
ADVANCED WITH A PLUMP LITTLE HAND EXTENDED MURMURING HIS REGRET FOR
HAVING MISSED US AT HIS FIRST VISIT HOLMES DISREGARDED THE
OUTSTRETCHED HAND AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH A FACE OF GRANITE
MILVERTONS SMILE BROADENED HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS REMOVED HIS
OVERCOAT FOLDED IT WITH GREAT DELIBERATION OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR
AND THEN TOOK A SEAT
THIS GENTLEMAN SAID HE WITH A WAVE IN MY DIRECTION IS IT
DISCREET IS IT RIGHT
DR WATSON IS MY FRIEND AND PARTNER
VERY GOOD MR HOLMES IT IS ONLY IN YOUR CLIENTS INTERESTS THAT I
PROTESTED THE MATTER IS SO VERY DELICATE
DR WATSON HAS ALREADY HEARD OF IT
THEN WE CAN PROCEED TO BUSINESS YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE ACTING FOR
LADY EVA HAS SHE EMPOWERED YOU TO ACCEPT MY TERMS
WHAT ARE YOUR TERMS
SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS
AND THE ALTERNATIVE
MY DEAR SIR IT IS PAINFUL FOR ME TO DISCUSS IT BUT IF THE MONEY IS
NOT PAID ON THE TH THERE CERTAINLY WILL BE NO MARRIAGE ON THE
TH HIS INSUFFERABLE SMILE WAS MORE COMPLACENT THAN EVER
HOLMES THOUGHT FOR A LITTLE
YOU APPEAR TO ME HE SAID AT LAST TO BE TAKING MATTERS TOO MUCH
FOR GRANTED I AM OF COURSE FAMILIAR WITH THE CONTENTS OF THESE
LETTERS MY CLIENT WILL CERTAINLY DO WHAT I MAY ADVISE I SHALL
COUNSEL HER TO TELL HER FUTURE HUSBAND THE WHOLE STORY AND TO TRUST
TO HIS GENEROSITY
MILVERTON CHUCKLED
YOU EVIDENTLY DO NOT KNOW THE EARL SAID HE
FROM THE BAFFLED LOOK UPON HOLMESS FACE I COULD SEE CLEARLY THAT HE
DID
WHAT HARM IS THERE IN THE LETTERS HE ASKED
THEY ARE SPRIGHTLYVERY SPRIGHTLY MILVERTON ANSWERED THE LADY
WAS A CHARMING CORRESPONDENT BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE EARL OF
DOVERCOURT WOULD FAIL TO APPRECIATE THEM HOWEVER SINCE YOU THINK
OTHERWISE WE WILL LET IT REST AT THAT IT IS PURELY A MATTER OF
BUSINESS IF YOU THINK THAT IT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF YOUR
CLIENT THAT THESE LETTERS SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE HANDS OF THE EARL
THEN YOU WOULD INDEED BE FOOLISH TO PAY SO LARGE A SUM OF MONEY TO
REGAIN THEM HE ROSE AND SEIZED HIS ASTRACHAN COAT
HOLMES WAS GREY WITH ANGER AND MORTIFICATION
WAIT A LITTLE HE SAID YOU GO TOO FAST WE WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE
EVERY EFFORT TO AVOID SCANDAL IN SO DELICATE A MATTER
MILVERTON RELAPSED INTO HIS CHAIR
I WAS SURE THAT YOU WOULD SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT HE PURRED
AT THE SAME TIME HOLMES CONTINUED LADY EVA IS NOT A WEALTHY
WOMAN I ASSURE YOU THAT TWO THOUSAND POUNDS WOULD BE A DRAIN UPON
HER RESOURCES AND THAT THE SUM YOU NAME IS UTTERLY BEYOND HER POWER
I BEG THEREFORE THAT YOU WILL MODERATE YOUR DEMANDS AND THAT YOU
WILL RETURN THE LETTERS AT THE PRICE I INDICATE WHICH IS I ASSURE
YOU THE HIGHEST THAT YOU CAN GET
MILVERTONS SMILE BROADENED AND HIS EYES TWINKLED HUMOROUSLY
I AM AWARE THAT WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE ABOUT THE LADYS RESOURCES
SAID HE AT THE SAME TIME YOU MUST ADMIT THAT THE OCCASION OF A
LADYS MARRIAGE IS A VERY SUITABLE TIME FOR HER FRIENDS AND RELATIVES
TO MAKE SOME LITTLE EFFORT UPON HER BEHALF THEY MAY HESITATE AS TO
AN ACCEPTABLE WEDDING PRESENT LET ME ASSURE THEM THAT THIS LITTLE
BUNDLE OF LETTERS WOULD GIVE MORE JOY THAN ALL THE CANDELABRA AND
BUTTERDISHES IN LONDON
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE SAID HOLMES
DEAR ME DEAR ME HOW UNFORTUNATE CRIED MILVERTON TAKING OUT A
BULKY POCKETBOOK I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT LADIES ARE
ILLADVISED IN NOT MAKING AN EFFORT LOOK AT THIS HE HELD UP A
LITTLE NOTE WITH A COATOFARMS UPON THE ENVELOPE THAT BELONGS
TOWELL PERHAPS IT IS HARDLY FAIR TO TELL THE NAME UNTIL TOMORROW
MORNING BUT AT THAT TIME IT WILL BE IN THE HANDS OF THE LADYS
HUSBAND AND ALL BECAUSE SHE WILL NOT FIND A BEGGARLY SUM WHICH SHE
COULD GET BY TURNING HER DIAMONDS INTO PASTE IT IS SUCH A PITY NOW
YOU REMEMBER THE SUDDEN END OF THE ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN THE HONOURABLE
MISS MILES AND COLONEL DORKING ONLY TWO DAYS BEFORE THE WEDDING
THERE WAS A PARAGRAPH IN THE MORNING POST TO SAY THAT IT WAS ALL OFF
AND WHY IT IS ALMOST INCREDIBLE BUT THE ABSURD SUM OF TWELVE
HUNDRED POUNDS WOULD HAVE SETTLED THE WHOLE QUESTION IS IT NOT
PITIFUL AND HERE I FIND YOU A MAN OF SENSE BOGGLING ABOUT TERMS
WHEN YOUR CLIENTS FUTURE AND HONOUR ARE AT STAKE YOU SURPRISE ME
MR HOLMES
WHAT I SAY IS TRUE HOLMES ANSWERED THE MONEY CANNOT BE FOUND
SURELY IT IS BETTER FOR YOU TO TAKE THE SUBSTANTIAL SUM WHICH I OFFER
THAN TO RUIN THIS WOMANS CAREER WHICH CAN PROFIT YOU IN NO WAY
THERE YOU MAKE A MISTAKE MR HOLMES AN EXPOSURE WOULD PROFIT ME
INDIRECTLY TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT I HAVE EIGHT OR TEN SIMILAR
CASES MATURING IF IT WAS CIRCULATED AMONG THEM THAT I HAD MADE A
SEVERE EXAMPLE OF THE LADY EVA I SHOULD FIND ALL OF THEM MUCH MORE
OPEN TO REASON YOU SEE MY POINT
HOLMES SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR
GET BEHIND HIM WATSON DONT LET HIM OUT NOW SIR LET US SEE THE
CONTENTS OF THAT NOTEBOOK
MILVERTON HAD GLIDED AS QUICK AS A RAT TO THE SIDE OF THE ROOM AND
STOOD WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE WALL
MR HOLMES MR HOLMES HE SAID TURNING THE FRONT OF HIS COAT AND
EXHIBITING THE BUTT OF A LARGE REVOLVER WHICH PROJECTED FROM THE
INSIDE POCKET I HAVE BEEN EXPECTING YOU TO DO SOMETHING ORIGINAL
THIS HAS BEEN DONE SO OFTEN AND WHAT GOOD HAS EVER COME FROM IT I
ASSURE YOU THAT I AM ARMED TO THE TEETH AND I AM PERFECTLY PREPARED
TO USE MY WEAPONS KNOWING THAT THE LAW WILL SUPPORT ME BESIDES
YOUR SUPPOSITION THAT I WOULD BRING THE LETTERS HERE IN A NOTEBOOK
IS ENTIRELY MISTAKEN I WOULD DO NOTHING SO FOOLISH AND NOW
GENTLEMEN I HAVE ONE OR TWO LITTLE INTERVIEWS THIS EVENING AND IT
IS A LONG DRIVE TO HAMPSTEAD HE STEPPED FORWARD TOOK UP HIS COAT
LAID HIS HAND ON HIS REVOLVER AND TURNED TO THE DOOR I PICKED UP A
CHAIR BUT HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD AND I LAID IT DOWN AGAIN WITH BOW
A SMILE AND A TWINKLE MILVERTON WAS OUT OF THE ROOM AND A FEW
MOMENTS AFTER WE HEARD THE SLAM OF THE CARRIAGE DOOR AND THE RATTLE
OF THE WHEELS AS HE DROVE AWAY
HOLMES SAT MOTIONLESS BY THE FIRE HIS HANDS BURIED DEEP IN HIS
TROUSER POCKETS HIS CHIN SUNK UPON HIS BREAST HIS EYES FIXED UPON
THE GLOWING EMBERS FOR HALF AN HOUR HE WAS SILENT AND STILL THEN
WITH THE GESTURE OF A MAN WHO HAS TAKEN HIS DECISION HE SPRANG TO
HIS FEET AND PASSED INTO HIS BEDROOM A LITTLE LATER A RAKISH YOUNG
WORKMAN WITH A GOATEE BEARD AND A SWAGGER LIT HIS CLAY PIPE AT THE
LAMP BEFORE DESCENDING INTO THE STREET ILL BE BACK SOME TIME
WATSON SAID HE AND VANISHED INTO THE NIGHT I UNDERSTOOD THAT HE
HAD OPENED HIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON BUT I
LITTLE DREAMED THE STRANGE SHAPE WHICH THAT CAMPAIGN WAS DESTINED TO
TAKE
FOR SOME DAYS HOLMES CAME AND WENT AT ALL HOURS IN THIS ATTIRE BUT
BEYOND A REMARK THAT HIS TIME WAS SPENT AT HAMPSTEAD AND THAT IT WAS
NOT WASTED I KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HE WAS DOING AT LAST HOWEVER ON
A WILD TEMPESTUOUS EVENING WHEN THE WIND SCREAMED AND RATTLED
AGAINST THE WINDOWS HE RETURNED FROM HIS LAST EXPEDITION AND HAVING
REMOVED HIS DISGUISE HE SAT BEFORE THE FIRE AND LAUGHED HEARTILY IN
HIS SILENT INWARD FASHION
YOU WOULD NOT CALL ME A MARRYING MAN WATSON
NO INDEED
YOULL BE INTERESTED TO HEAR THAT I AM ENGAGED
MY DEAR FELLOW I CONGRAT
TO MILVERTONS HOUSEMAID
GOOD HEAVENS HOLMES
I WANTED INFORMATION WATSON
SURELY YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR
IT WAS A MOST NECESSARY STEP I AM A PLUMBER WITH A RISING BUSINESS
ESCOTT BY NAME I HAVE WALKED OUT WITH HER EACH EVENING AND I HAVE
TALKED WITH HER GOOD HEAVENS THOSE TALKS HOWEVER I HAVE GOT ALL I
WANTED I KNOW MILVERTONS HOUSE AS I KNOW THE PALM OF MY HAND
BUT THE GIRL HOLMES
HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
YOU CANT HELP IT MY DEAR WATSON YOU MUST PLAY YOUR CARDS AS BEST
YOU CAN WHEN SUCH A STAKE IS ON THE TABLE HOWEVER I REJOICE TO SAY
THAT I HAVE A HATED RIVAL WHO WILL CERTAINLY CUT ME OUT THE INSTANT
THAT MY BACK IS TURNED WHAT A SPLENDID NIGHT IT IS
YOU LIKE THIS WEATHER
IT SUITS MY PURPOSE WATSON I MEAN TO BURGLE MILVERTONS HOUSE
TONIGHT
I HAD A CATCHING OF THE BREATH AND MY SKIN WENT COLD AT THE WORDS
WHICH WERE SLOWLY UTTERED IN A TONE OF CONCENTRATED RESOLUTION AS A
FLASH OF LIGHTNING IN THE NIGHT SHOWS UP IN AN INSTANT EVERY DETAIL
OF A WIDE LANDSCAPE SO AT ONE GLANCE I SEEMED TO SEE EVERY POSSIBLE
RESULT OF SUCH AN ACTIONTHE DETECTION THE CAPTURE THE HONOURED
CAREER ENDING IN IRREPARABLE FAILURE AND DISGRACE MY FRIEND HIMSELF
LYING AT THE MERCY OF THE ODIOUS MILVERTON
FOR HEAVENS SAKE HOLMES THINK WHAT YOU ARE DOING I CRIED
MY DEAR FELLOW I HAVE GIVEN IT EVERY CONSIDERATION I AM NEVER
PRECIPITATE IN MY ACTIONS NOR WOULD I ADOPT SO ENERGETIC AND INDEED
SO DANGEROUS A COURSE IF ANY OTHER WERE POSSIBLE LET US LOOK AT THE
MATTER CLEARLY AND FAIRLY I SUPPOSE THAT YOU WILL ADMIT THAT THE
ACTION IS MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE THOUGH TECHNICALLY CRIMINAL TO BURGLE
HIS HOUSE IS NO MORE THAN TO FORCIBLY TAKE HIS POCKETBOOKAN ACTION
IN WHICH YOU WERE PREPARED TO AID ME
I TURNED IT OVER IN MY MIND
YES I SAID IT IS MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE SO LONG AS OUR OBJECT IS TO
TAKE NO ARTICLES SAVE THOSE WHICH ARE USED FOR AN ILLEGAL PURPOSE
EXACTLY SINCE IT IS MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE I HAVE ONLY TO CONSIDER THE
QUESTION OF PERSONAL RISK SURELY A GENTLEMAN SHOULD NOT LAY MUCH
STRESS UPON THIS WHEN A LADY IS IN MOST DESPERATE NEED OF HIS HELP
YOU WILL BE IN SUCH A FALSE POSITION
WELL THAT IS PART OF THE RISK THERE IS NO OTHER POSSIBLE WAY OF
REGAINING THESE LETTERS THE UNFORTUNATE LADY HAS NOT THE MONEY AND
THERE ARE NONE OF HER PEOPLE IN WHOM SHE COULD CONFIDE TOMORROW IS
THE LAST DAY OF GRACE AND UNLESS WE CAN GET THE LETTERS TONIGHT
THIS VILLAIN WILL BE AS GOOD AS HIS WORD AND WILL BRING ABOUT HER
RUIN I MUST THEREFORE ABANDON MY CLIENT TO HER FATE OR I MUST PLAY
THIS LAST CARD BETWEEN OURSELVES WATSON ITS A SPORTING DUEL
BETWEEN THIS FELLOW MILVERTON AND ME HE HAD AS YOU SAW THE BEST OF
THE FIRST EXCHANGES BUT MY SELFRESPECT AND MY REPUTATION ARE
CONCERNED TO FIGHT IT TO A FINISH
WELL I DONT LIKE IT BUT I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE SAID I WHEN DO
WE START
YOU ARE NOT COMING
THEN YOU ARE NOT GOING SAID I I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOURAND
I NEVER BROKE IT IN MY LIFETHAT I WILL TAKE A CAB STRAIGHT TO THE
POLICESTATION AND GIVE YOU AWAY UNLESS YOU LET ME SHARE THIS
ADVENTURE WITH YOU
YOU CANT HELP ME
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU CANT TELL WHAT MAY HAPPEN ANYWAY MY
RESOLUTION IS TAKEN OTHER PEOPLE BESIDE YOU HAVE SELFRESPECT AND
EVEN REPUTATIONS
HOLMES HAD LOOKED ANNOYED BUT HIS BROW CLEARED AND HE CLAPPED ME ON
THE SHOULDER
WELL WELL MY DEAR FELLOW BE IT SO WE HAVE SHARED THE SAME ROOM
FOR SOME YEARS AND IT WOULD BE AMUSING IF WE ENDED BY SHARING THE
SAME CELL YOU KNOW WATSON I DONT MIND CONFESSING TO YOU THAT I
HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN IDEA THAT I WOULD HAVE MADE A HIGHLY EFFICIENT
CRIMINAL THIS IS THE CHANCE OF MY LIFETIME IN THAT DIRECTION SEE
HERE HE TOOK A NEAT LITTLE LEATHER CASE OUT OF A DRAWER AND
OPENING IT HE EXHIBITED A NUMBER OF SHINING INSTRUMENTS THIS IS A
FIRSTCLASS UPTODATE BURGLING KIT WITH NICKELPLATED JEMMY
DIAMONDTIPPED GLASSCUTTER ADAPTABLE KEYS AND EVERY MODERN
IMPROVEMENT WHICH THE MARCH OF CIVILIZATION DEMANDS HERE TOO IS MY
DARK LANTERN EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER HAVE YOU A PAIR OF SILENT
SHOES
I HAVE RUBBERSOLED TENNIS SHOES

I CAN SEE THAT YOU HAVE A STRONG NATURAL TURN FOR THIS SORT OF
THING VERY GOOD DO YOU MAKE THE MASKS WE SHALL HAVE SOME COLD
SUPPER BEFORE WE START IT IS NOW NINETHIRTY AT ELEVEN WE SHALL
DRIVE AS FAR AS CHURCH ROW IT IS A QUARTER OF AN HOURS WALK FROM
THERE TO APPLEDORE TOWERS WE SHALL BE AT WORK BEFORE MIDNIGHT
MILVERTON IS A HEAVY SLEEPER AND RETIRES PUNCTUALLY AT TENTHIRTY
WITH ANY LUCK WE SHOULD BE BACK HERE BY TWO WITH THE LADY EVAS
LETTERS IN MY POCKET
HOLMES AND I PUT ON OUR DRESSCLOTHES SO THAT WE MIGHT APPEAR TO BE
TWO THEATREGOERS HOMEWARD BOUND IN OXFORD STREET WE PICKED UP A
HANSOM AND DROVE TO AN ADDRESS IN HAMPSTEAD HERE WE PAID OFF OUR
CAB AND WITH OUR GREATCOATS BUTTONED UP FOR IT WAS BITTERLY COLD
AND THE WIND SEEMED TO BLOW THROUGH US WE WALKED ALONG THE EDGE OF
THE HEATH
ITS A BUSINESS THAT NEEDS DELICATE TREATMENT SAID HOLMES THESE
DOCUMENTS ARE CONTAINED IN A SAFE IN THE FELLOWS STUDY AND THE
STUDY IS THE ANTEROOM OF HIS BEDCHAMBER ON THE OTHER HAND LIKE
ALL THESE STOUT LITTLE MEN WHO DO THEMSELVES WELL HE IS A PLETHORIC
SLEEPER AGATHATHATS MY FIANCEESAYS IT IS A JOKE IN THE
SERVANTS HALL THAT ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO WAKE THE MASTER HE HAS A
SECRETARY WHO IS DEVOTED TO HIS INTERESTS AND NEVER BUDGES FROM THE
STUDY ALL DAY THATS WHY WE ARE GOING AT NIGHT THEN HE HAS A BEAST
OF A DOG WHICH ROAMS THE GARDEN I MET AGATHA LATE THE LAST TWO
EVENINGS AND SHE LOCKS THE BRUTE UP SO AS TO GIVE ME A CLEAR RUN
THIS IS THE HOUSE THIS BIG ONE IN ITS OWN GROUNDS THROUGH THE
GATENOW TO THE RIGHT AMONG THE LAURELS WE MIGHT PUT ON OUR MASKS
HERE I THINK YOU SEE THERE IS NOT A GLIMMER OF LIGHT IN ANY OF THE
WINDOWS AND EVERYTHING IS WORKING SPLENDIDLY
WITH OUR BLACK SILK FACECOVERINGS WHICH TURNED US INTO TWO OF THE
MOST TRUCULENT FIGURES IN LONDON WE STOLE UP TO THE SILENT GLOOMY
HOUSE A SORT OF TILED VERANDA EXTENDED ALONG ONE SIDE OF IT LINED
BY SEVERAL WINDOWS AND TWO DOORS
THATS HIS BEDROOM HOLMES WHISPERED THIS DOOR OPENS STRAIGHT
INTO THE STUDY IT WOULD SUIT US BEST BUT IT IS BOLTED AS WELL AS
LOCKED AND WE SHOULD MAKE TOO MUCH NOISE GETTING IN COME ROUND
HERE THERES A GREENHOUSE WHICH OPENS INTO THE DRAWINGROOM
THE PLACE WAS LOCKED BUT HOLMES REMOVED A CIRCLE OF GLASS AND TURNED
THE KEY FROM THE INSIDE AN INSTANT AFTERWARDS HE HAD CLOSED THE DOOR
BEHIND US AND WE HAD BECOME FELONS IN THE EYES OF THE LAW THE
THICK WARM AIR OF THE CONSERVATORY AND THE RICH CHOKING FRAGRANCE
OF EXOTIC PLANTS TOOK US BY THE THROAT HE SEIZED MY HAND IN THE
DARKNESS AND LED ME SWIFTLY PAST BANKS OF SHRUBS WHICH BRUSHED
AGAINST OUR FACES HOLMES HAD REMARKABLE POWERS CAREFULLY
CULTIVATED OF SEEING IN THE DARK STILL HOLDING MY HAND IN ONE OF
HIS HE OPENED A DOOR AND I WAS VAGUELY CONSCIOUS THAT WE HAD ENTERED
A LARGE ROOM IN WHICH A CIGAR HAD BEEN SMOKED NOT LONG BEFORE HE
FELT HIS WAY AMONG THE FURNITURE OPENED ANOTHER DOOR AND CLOSED IT
BEHIND US PUTTING OUT MY HAND I FELT SEVERAL COATS HANGING FROM THE
WALL AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT I WAS IN A PASSAGE WE PASSED ALONG IT
AND HOLMES VERY GENTLY OPENED A DOOR UPON THE RIGHTHAND SIDE
SOMETHING RUSHED OUT AT US AND MY HEART SPRANG INTO MY MOUTH BUT I
COULD HAVE LAUGHED WHEN I REALIZED THAT IT WAS THE CAT A FIRE WAS
BURNING IN THIS NEW ROOM AND AGAIN THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH TOBACCO
SMOKE HOLMES ENTERED ON TIPTOE WAITED FOR ME TO FOLLOW AND THEN
VERY GENTLY CLOSED THE DOOR WE WERE IN MILVERTONS STUDY AND A
PORTIERE AT THE FARTHER SIDE SHOWED THE ENTRANCE TO HIS BEDROOM
IT WAS A GOOD FIRE AND THE ROOM WAS ILLUMINATED BY IT NEAR THE DOOR
I SAW THE GLEAM OF AN ELECTRIC SWITCH BUT IT WAS UNNECESSARY EVEN
IF IT HAD BEEN SAFE TO TURN IT ON AT ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE WAS
A HEAVY CURTAIN WHICH COVERED THE BAY WINDOW WE HAD SEEN FROM
OUTSIDE ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATED WITH THE
VERANDA A DESK STOOD IN THE CENTRE WITH A TURNING CHAIR OF SHINING
RED LEATHER OPPOSITE WAS A LARGE BOOKCASE WITH A MARBLE BUST OF
ATHENE ON THE TOP IN THE CORNER BETWEEN THE BOOKCASE AND THE WALL
THERE STOOD A TALL GREEN SAFE THE FIRELIGHT FLASHING BACK FROM THE
POLISHED BRASS KNOBS UPON ITS FACE HOLMES STOLE ACROSS AND LOOKED AT
IT THEN HE CREPT TO THE DOOR OF THE BEDROOM AND STOOD WITH SLANTING
HEAD LISTENING INTENTLY NO SOUND CAME FROM WITHIN MEANWHILE IT HAD
STRUCK ME THAT IT WOULD BE WISE TO SECURE OUR RETREAT THROUGH THE
OUTER DOOR SO I EXAMINED IT TO MY AMAZEMENT IT WAS NEITHER LOCKED
NOR BOLTED I TOUCHED HOLMES ON THE ARM AND HE TURNED HIS MASKED
FACE IN THAT DIRECTION I SAW HIM START AND HE WAS EVIDENTLY AS
SURPRISED AS I
I DONT LIKE IT HE WHISPERED PUTTING HIS LIPS TO MY VERY EAR I
CANT QUITE MAKE IT OUT ANYHOW WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
CAN I DO ANYTHING
YES STAND BY THE DOOR IF YOU HEAR ANYONE COME BOLT IT ON THE
INSIDE AND WE CAN GET AWAY AS WE CAME IF THEY COME THE OTHER WAY
WE CAN GET THROUGH THE DOOR IF OUR JOB IS DONE OR HIDE BEHIND THESE
WINDOW CURTAINS IF IT IS NOT DO YOU UNDERSTAND
I NODDED AND STOOD BY THE DOOR MY FIRST FEELING OF FEAR HAD PASSED
AWAY AND I THRILLED NOW WITH A KEENER ZEST THAN I HAD EVER ENJOYED
WHEN WE WERE THE DEFENDERS OF THE LAW INSTEAD OF ITS DEFIERS THE
HIGH OBJECT OF OUR MISSION THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IT WAS UNSELFISH
AND CHIVALROUS THE VILLAINOUS CHARACTER OF OUR OPPONENT ALL ADDED
TO THE SPORTING INTEREST OF THE ADVENTURE FAR FROM FEELING GUILTY I
REJOICED AND EXULTED IN OUR DANGERS WITH A GLOW OF ADMIRATION I
WATCHED HOLMES UNROLLING HIS CASE OF INSTRUMENTS AND CHOOSING HIS
TOOL WITH THE CALM SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY OF A SURGEON WHO PERFORMS A
DELICATE OPERATION I KNEW THAT THE OPENING OF SAFES WAS A PARTICULAR
HOBBY WITH HIM AND I UNDERSTOOD THE JOY WHICH IT GAVE HIM TO BE
CONFRONTED WITH THIS GREEN AND GOLD MONSTER THE DRAGON WHICH HELD IN
ITS MAW THE REPUTATIONS OF MANY FAIR LADIES TURNING UP THE CUFFS OF
HIS DRESSCOATHE HAD PLACED HIS OVERCOAT ON A CHAIRHOLMES LAID
OUT TWO DRILLS A JEMMY AND SEVERAL SKELETON KEYS I STOOD AT THE
CENTRE DOOR WITH MY EYES GLANCING AT EACH OF THE OTHERS READY FOR
ANY EMERGENCY THOUGH INDEED MY PLANS WERE SOMEWHAT VAGUE AS TO
WHAT I SHOULD DO IF WE WERE INTERRUPTED FOR HALF AN HOUR HOLMES
WORKED WITH CONCENTRATED ENERGY LAYING DOWN ONE TOOL PICKING UP
ANOTHER HANDLING EACH WITH THE STRENGTH AND DELICACY OF THE TRAINED
MECHANIC FINALLY I HEARD A CLICK THE BROAD GREEN DOOR SWUNG OPEN
AND INSIDE I HAD A GLIMPSE OF A NUMBER OF PAPER PACKETS EACH TIED
SEALED AND INSCRIBED HOLMES PICKED ONE OUT BUT IT WAS HARD TO READ
BY THE FLICKERING FIRE AND HE DREW OUT HIS LITTLE DARK LANTERN FOR
IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS WITH MILVERTON IN THE NEXT ROOM TO SWITCH ON
THE ELECTRIC LIGHT SUDDENLY I SAW HIM HALT LISTEN INTENTLY AND
THEN IN AN INSTANT HE HAD SWUNG THE DOOR OF THE SAFE TO PICKED UP
HIS COAT STUFFED HIS TOOLS INTO THE POCKETS AND DARTED BEHIND THE
WINDOW CURTAIN MOTIONING ME TO DO THE SAME
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I HAD JOINED HIM THERE THAT I HEARD WHAT HAD ALARMED
HIS QUICKER SENSES THERE WAS A NOISE SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE HOUSE A
DOOR SLAMMED IN THE DISTANCE THEN A CONFUSED DULL MURMUR BROKE
ITSELF INTO THE MEASURED THUD OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS RAPIDLY APPROACHING
THEY WERE IN THE PASSAGE OUTSIDE THE ROOM THEY PAUSED AT THE DOOR
THE DOOR OPENED THERE WAS A SHARP SNICK AS THE ELECTRIC LIGHT WAS
TURNED ON THE DOOR CLOSED ONCE MORE AND THE PUNGENT REEK OF A
STRONG CIGAR WAS BORNE TO OUR NOSTRILS THEN THE FOOTSTEPS CONTINUED
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF
US FINALLY THERE WAS A CREAK FROM A CHAIR AND THE FOOTSTEPS
CEASED THEN A KEY CLICKED IN A LOCK AND I HEARD THE RUSTLE OF
PAPERS
SO FAR I HAD NOT DARED TO LOOK OUT BUT NOW I GENTLY PARTED THE
DIVISION OF THE CURTAINS IN FRONT OF ME AND PEEPED THROUGH FROM THE
PRESSURE OF HOLMESS SHOULDER AGAINST MINE I KNEW THAT HE WAS SHARING
MY OBSERVATIONS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US AND ALMOST WITHIN OUR REACH
WAS THE BROAD ROUNDED BACK OF MILVERTON IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE HAD
ENTIRELY MISCALCULATED HIS MOVEMENTS THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN TO HIS
BEDROOM BUT THAT HE HAD BEEN SITTING UP IN SOME SMOKING OR BILLIARD
ROOM IN THE FARTHER WING OF THE HOUSE THE WINDOWS OF WHICH WE HAD
NOT SEEN HIS BROAD GRIZZLED HEAD WITH ITS SHINING PATCH OF
BALDNESS WAS IN THE IMMEDIATE FOREGROUND OF OUR VISION HE WAS
LEANING FAR BACK IN THE RED LEATHER CHAIR HIS LEGS OUTSTRETCHED A
LONG BLACK CIGAR PROJECTING AT AN ANGLE FROM HIS MOUTH HE WORE A
SEMIMILITARY SMOKING JACKET CLARETCOLOURED WITH A BLACK VELVET
COLLAR IN HIS HAND HE HELD A LONG LEGAL DOCUMENT WHICH HE WAS
READING IN AN INDOLENT FASHION BLOWING RINGS OF TOBACCO SMOKE FROM
HIS LIPS AS HE DID SO THERE WAS NO PROMISE OF A SPEEDY DEPARTURE IN
HIS COMPOSED BEARING AND HIS COMFORTABLE ATTITUDE
I FELT HOLMESS HAND STEAL INTO MINE AND GIVE ME A REASSURING SHAKE
AS IF TO SAY THAT THE SITUATION WAS WITHIN HIS POWERS AND THAT HE WAS
EASY IN HIS MIND I WAS NOT SURE WHETHER HE HAD SEEN WHAT WAS ONLY
TOO OBVIOUS FROM MY POSITION THAT THE DOOR OF THE SAFE WAS
IMPERFECTLY CLOSED AND THAT MILVERTON MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT OBSERVE
IT IN MY OWN MIND I HAD DETERMINED THAT IF I WERE SURE FROM THE
RIGIDITY OF HIS GAZE THAT IT HAD CAUGHT HIS EYE I WOULD AT ONCE
SPRING OUT THROW MY GREATCOAT OVER HIS HEAD PINION HIM AND LEAVE
THE REST TO HOLMES BUT MILVERTON NEVER LOOKED UP HE WAS LANGUIDLY
INTERESTED BY THE PAPERS IN HIS HAND AND PAGE AFTER PAGE WAS TURNED
AS HE FOLLOWED THE ARGUMENT OF THE LAWYER AT LEAST I THOUGHT WHEN
HE HAS FINISHED THE DOCUMENT AND THE CIGAR HE WILL GO TO HIS ROOM
BUT BEFORE HE HAD REACHED THE END OF EITHER THERE CAME A REMARKABLE
DEVELOPMENT WHICH TURNED OUR THOUGHTS INTO QUITE ANOTHER CHANNEL
SEVERAL TIMES I HAD OBSERVED THAT MILVERTON LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND
ONCE HE HAD RISEN AND SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH A GESTURE OF IMPATIENCE
THE IDEA HOWEVER THAT HE MIGHT HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT SO STRANGE AN
HOUR NEVER OCCURRED TO ME UNTIL A FAINT SOUND REACHED MY EARS FROM
THE VERANDA OUTSIDE MILVERTON DROPPED HIS PAPERS AND SAT RIGID IN
HIS CHAIR THE SOUND WAS REPEATED AND THEN THERE CAME A GENTLE TAP
AT THE DOOR MILVERTON ROSE AND OPENED IT
WELL SAID HE CURTLY YOU ARE NEARLY HALF AN HOUR LATE
SO THIS WAS THE EXPLANATION OF THE UNLOCKED DOOR AND OF THE NOCTURNAL
VIGIL OF MILVERTON THERE WAS THE GENTLE RUSTLE OF A WOMANS DRESS I
HAD CLOSED THE SLIT BETWEEN THE CURTAINS AS MILVERTONS FACE HAD
TURNED IN OUR DIRECTION BUT NOW I VENTURED VERY CAREFULLY TO OPEN IT
ONCE MORE HE HAD RESUMED HIS SEAT THE CIGAR STILL PROJECTING AT AN
INSOLENT ANGLE FROM THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH IN FRONT OF HIM IN THE
FULL GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT THERE STOOD A TALL SLIM DARK
WOMAN A VEIL OVER HER FACE A MANTLE DRAWN ROUND HER CHIN HER
BREATH CAME QUICK AND FAST AND EVERY INCH OF THE LITHE FIGURE WAS
QUIVERING WITH STRONG EMOTION
WELL SAID MILVERTON YOUVE MADE ME LOSE A GOOD NIGHTS REST MY
DEAR I HOPE YOULL PROVE WORTH IT YOU COULDNT COME ANY OTHER
TIMEEH
THE WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD
WELL IF YOU COULDNT YOU COULDNT IF THE COUNTESS IS A HARD
MISTRESS YOU HAVE YOUR CHANCE TO GET LEVEL WITH HER NOW BLESS THE
GIRL WHAT ARE YOU SHIVERING ABOUT THATS RIGHT PULL YOURSELF
TOGETHER NOW LET US GET DOWN TO BUSINESS HE TOOK A NOTE FROM THE
DRAWER OF HIS DESK YOU SAY THAT YOU HAVE FIVE LETTERS WHICH
COMPROMISE THE COUNTESS DALBERT YOU WANT TO SELL THEM I WANT TO
BUY THEM SO FAR SO GOOD IT ONLY REMAINS TO FIX A PRICE I SHOULD
WANT TO INSPECT THE LETTERS OF COURSE IF THEY ARE REALLY GOOD
SPECIMENSGREAT HEAVENS IS IT YOU
THE WOMAN WITHOUT A WORD HAD RAISED HER VEIL AND DROPPED THE MANTLE
FROM HER CHIN IT WAS A DARK HANDSOME CLEARCUT FACE WHICH
CONFRONTED MILVERTON A FACE WITH A CURVED NOSE STRONG DARK
EYEBROWS SHADING HARD GLITTERING EYES AND A STRAIGHT THINLIPPED
MOUTH SET IN A DANGEROUS SMILE
IT IS I SHE SAID THE WOMAN WHOSE LIFE YOU HAVE RUINED
MILVERTON LAUGHED BUT FEAR VIBRATED IN HIS VOICE YOU WERE SO VERY
OBSTINATE SAID HE WHY DID YOU DRIVE ME TO SUCH EXTREMITIES I
ASSURE YOU I WOULDNT HURT A FLY OF MY OWN ACCORD BUT EVERY MAN HAS
HIS BUSINESS AND WHAT WAS I TO DO I PUT THE PRICE WELL WITHIN YOUR
MEANS YOU WOULD NOT PAY
SO YOU SENT THE LETTERS TO MY HUSBAND AND HETHE NOBLEST GENTLEMAN
THAT EVER LIVED A MAN WHOSE BOOTS I WAS NEVER WORTHY TO LACEHE
BROKE HIS GALLANT HEART AND DIED YOU REMEMBER THAT LAST NIGHT WHEN I
CAME THROUGH THAT DOOR I BEGGED AND PRAYED YOU FOR MERCY AND YOU
LAUGHED IN MY FACE AS YOU ARE TRYING TO LAUGH NOW ONLY YOUR COWARD
HEART CANNOT KEEP YOUR LIPS FROM TWITCHING YES YOU NEVER THOUGHT TO
SEE ME HERE AGAIN BUT IT WAS THAT NIGHT WHICH TAUGHT ME HOW I COULD
MEET YOU FACE TO FACE AND ALONE WELL CHARLES MILVERTON WHAT HAVE
YOU TO SAY
DONT IMAGINE THAT YOU CAN BULLY ME SAID HE RISING TO HIS FEET
I HAVE ONLY TO RAISE MY VOICE AND I COULD CALL MY SERVANTS AND HAVE
YOU ARRESTED BUT I WILL MAKE ALLOWANCE FOR YOUR NATURAL ANGER LEAVE
THE ROOM AT ONCE AS YOU CAME AND I WILL SAY NO MORE
THE WOMAN STOOD WITH HER HAND BURIED IN HER BOSOM AND THE SAME
DEADLY SMILE ON HER THIN LIPS
YOU WILL RUIN NO MORE LIVES AS YOU RUINED MINE YOU WILL WRING NO
MORE HEARTS AS YOU WRUNG MINE I WILL FREE THE WORLD OF A POISONOUS
THING TAKE THAT YOU HOUND AND THATAND THATAND THAT
SHE HAD DRAWN A LITTLE GLEAMING REVOLVER AND EMPTIED BARREL AFTER
BARREL INTO MILVERTONS BODY THE MUZZLE WITHIN TWO FEET OF HIS SHIRT
FRONT HE SHRANK AWAY AND THEN FELL FORWARD UPON THE TABLE COUGHING
FURIOUSLY AND CLAWING AMONG THE PAPERS THEN HE STAGGERED TO HIS
FEET RECEIVED ANOTHER SHOT AND ROLLED UPON THE FLOOR YOUVE DONE
ME HE CRIED AND LAY STILL THE WOMAN LOOKED AT HIM INTENTLY AND
GROUND HER HEEL INTO HIS UPTURNED FACE SHE LOOKED AGAIN BUT THERE
WAS NO SOUND OR MOVEMENT I HEARD A SHARP RUSTLE THE NIGHT AIR BLEW
INTO THE HEATED ROOM AND THE AVENGER WAS GONE
NO INTERFERENCE UPON OUR PART COULD HAVE SAVED THE MAN FROM HIS FATE
BUT AS THE WOMAN POURED BULLET AFTER BULLET INTO MILVERTONS
SHRINKING BODY I WAS ABOUT TO SPRING OUT WHEN I FELT HOLMESS COLD
STRONG GRASP UPON MY WRIST I UNDERSTOOD THE WHOLE ARGUMENT OF THAT
FIRM RESTRAINING GRIPTHAT IT WAS NO AFFAIR OF OURS THAT JUSTICE
HAD OVERTAKEN A VILLAIN THAT WE HAD OUR OWN DUTIES AND OUR OWN
OBJECTS WHICH WERE NOT TO BE LOST SIGHT OF BUT HARDLY HAD THE WOMAN
RUSHED FROM THE ROOM WHEN HOLMES WITH SWIFT SILENT STEPS WAS OVER
AT THE OTHER DOOR HE TURNED THE KEY IN THE LOCK AT THE SAME INSTANT
WE HEARD VOICES IN THE HOUSE AND THE SOUND OF HURRYING FEET THE
REVOLVER SHOTS HAD ROUSED THE HOUSEHOLD WITH PERFECT COOLNESS HOLMES
SLIPPED ACROSS TO THE SAFE FILLED HIS TWO ARMS WITH BUNDLES OF
LETTERS AND POURED THEM ALL INTO THE FIRE AGAIN AND AGAIN HE DID
IT UNTIL THE SAFE WAS EMPTY SOMEONE TURNED THE HANDLE AND BEAT UPON
THE OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR HOLMES LOOKED SWIFTLY ROUND THE LETTER
WHICH HAD BEEN THE MESSENGER OF DEATH FOR MILVERTON LAY ALL MOTTLED
WITH HIS BLOOD UPON THE TABLE HOLMES TOSSED IT IN AMONG THE BLAZING
PAPERS THEN HE DREW THE KEY FROM THE OUTER DOOR PASSED THROUGH
AFTER ME AND LOCKED IT ON THE OUTSIDE THIS WAY WATSON SAID HE
WE CAN SCALE THE GARDEN WALL IN THIS DIRECTION
I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED THAT AN ALARM COULD HAVE SPREAD SO SWIFTLY
LOOKING BACK THE HUGE HOUSE WAS ONE BLAZE OF LIGHT THE FRONT DOOR
WAS OPEN AND FIGURES WERE RUSHING DOWN THE DRIVE THE WHOLE GARDEN
WAS ALIVE WITH PEOPLE AND ONE FELLOW RAISED A VIEWHALLOA AS WE
EMERGED FROM THE VERANDA AND FOLLOWED HARD AT OUR HEELS HOLMES
SEEMED TO KNOW THE GROUND PERFECTLY AND HE THREADED HIS WAY SWIFTLY
AMONG A PLANTATION OF SMALL TREES I CLOSE AT HIS HEELS AND OUR
FOREMOST PURSUER PANTING BEHIND US IT WAS A SIXFOOT WALL WHICH
BARRED OUR PATH BUT HE SPRANG TO THE TOP AND OVER AS I DID THE SAME
I FELT THE HAND OF THE MAN BEHIND ME GRAB AT MY ANKLE BUT I KICKED
MYSELF FREE AND SCRAMBLED OVER A GLASSSTREWN COPING I FELL UPON MY
FACE AMONG SOME BUSHES BUT HOLMES HAD ME ON MY FEET IN AN INSTANT
AND TOGETHER WE DASHED AWAY ACROSS THE HUGE EXPANSE OF HAMPSTEAD
HEATH WE HAD RUN TWO MILES I SUPPOSE BEFORE HOLMES AT LAST HALTED
AND LISTENED INTENTLY ALL WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE BEHIND US WE HAD
SHAKEN OFF OUR PURSUERS AND WERE SAFE
WE HAD BREAKFASTED AND WERE SMOKING OUR MORNING PIPE ON THE DAY AFTER
THE REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE WHICH I HAVE RECORDED WHEN MR LESTRADE OF
SCOTLAND YARD VERY SOLEMN AND IMPRESSIVE WAS USHERED INTO OUR
MODEST SITTINGROOM
GOOD MORNING MR HOLMES SAID HE GOOD MORNING MAY I ASK IF YOU
ARE VERY BUSY JUST NOW
NOT TOO BUSY TO LISTEN TO YOU
I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS IF YOU HAD NOTHING PARTICULAR ON HAND YOU
MIGHT CARE TO ASSIST US IN A MOST REMARKABLE CASE WHICH OCCURRED ONLY
LAST NIGHT AT HAMPSTEAD
DEAR ME SAID HOLMES WHAT WAS THAT
A MURDERA MOST DRAMATIC AND REMARKABLE MURDER I KNOW HOW KEEN YOU
ARE UPON THESE THINGS AND I WOULD TAKE IT AS A GREAT FAVOUR IF YOU
WOULD STEP DOWN TO APPLEDORE TOWERS AND GIVE US THE BENEFIT OF YOUR
ADVICE IT IS NO ORDINARY CRIME WE HAVE HAD OUR EYES UPON THIS MR
MILVERTON FOR SOME TIME AND BETWEEN OURSELVES HE WAS A BIT OF A
VILLAIN HE IS KNOWN TO HAVE HELD PAPERS WHICH HE USED FOR
BLACKMAILING PURPOSES THESE PAPERS HAVE ALL BEEN BURNED BY THE
MURDERERS NO ARTICLE OF VALUE WAS TAKEN AS IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE
CRIMINALS WERE MEN OF GOOD POSITION WHOSE SOLE OBJECT WAS TO PREVENT
SOCIAL EXPOSURE
CRIMINALS SAID HOLMES PLURAL
YES THERE WERE TWO OF THEM THEY WERE AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE
CAPTURED REDHANDED WE HAVE THEIR FOOTMARKS WE HAVE THEIR
DESCRIPTION ITS TEN TO ONE THAT WE TRACE THEM THE FIRST FELLOW WAS
A BIT TOO ACTIVE BUT THE SECOND WAS CAUGHT BY THE UNDERGARDENER AND
ONLY GOT AWAY AFTER A STRUGGLE HE WAS A MIDDLESIZED STRONGLYBUILT
MANSQUARE JAW THICK NECK MOUSTACHE A MASK OVER HIS EYES
THATS RATHER VAGUE SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES WHY IT MIGHT BE A
DESCRIPTION OF WATSON
ITS TRUE SAID THE INSPECTOR WITH MUCH AMUSEMENT IT MIGHT BE A
DESCRIPTION OF WATSON
WELL I AM AFRAID I CANT HELP YOU LESTRADE SAID HOLMES THE
FACT IS THAT I KNEW THIS FELLOW MILVERTON THAT I CONSIDERED HIM ONE
OF THE MOST DANGEROUS MEN IN LONDON AND THAT I THINK THERE ARE
CERTAIN CRIMES WHICH THE LAW CANNOT TOUCH AND WHICH THEREFORE TO
SOME EXTENT JUSTIFY PRIVATE REVENGE NO ITS NO USE ARGUING I HAVE
MADE UP MY MIND MY SYMPATHIES ARE WITH THE CRIMINALS RATHER THAN
WITH THE VICTIM AND I WILL NOT HANDLE THIS CASE
HOLMES HAD NOT SAID ONE WORD TO ME ABOUT THE TRAGEDY WHICH WE HAD
WITNESSED BUT I OBSERVED ALL THE MORNING THAT HE WAS IN HIS MOST
THOUGHTFUL MOOD AND HE GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION FROM HIS VACANT EYES
AND HIS ABSTRACTED MANNER OF A MAN WHO IS STRIVING TO RECALL
SOMETHING TO HIS MEMORY WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR LUNCH WHEN HE
SUDDENLY SPRANG TO HIS FEET BY JOVE WATSON IVE GOT IT HE
CRIED TAKE YOUR HAT COME WITH ME HE HURRIED AT HIS TOP SPEED
DOWN BAKER STREET AND ALONG OXFORD STREET UNTIL WE HAD ALMOST
REACHED REGENT CIRCUS HERE ON THE LEFT HAND THERE STANDS A SHOP
WINDOW FILLED WITH PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CELEBRITIES AND BEAUTIES OF THE
DAY HOLMESS EYES FIXED THEMSELVES UPON ONE OF THEM AND FOLLOWING
HIS GAZE I SAW THE PICTURE OF A REGAL AND STATELY LADY IN COURT
DRESS WITH A HIGH DIAMOND TIARA UPON HER NOBLE HEAD I LOOKED AT
THAT DELICATELYCURVED NOSE AT THE MARKED EYEBROWS AT THE STRAIGHT
MOUTH AND THE STRONG LITTLE CHIN BENEATH IT THEN I CAUGHT MY BREATH
AS I READ THE TIMEHONOURED TITLE OF THE GREAT NOBLEMAN AND STATESMAN
WHOSE WIFE SHE HAD BEEN MY EYES MET THOSE OF HOLMES AND HE PUT HIS
FINGER TO HIS LIPS AS WE TURNED AWAY FROM THE WINDOW
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS
IT WAS NO VERY UNUSUAL THING FOR MR LESTRADE OF SCOTLAND YARD TO
LOOK IN UPON US OF AN EVENING AND HIS VISITS WERE WELCOME TO
SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR THEY ENABLED HIM TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ALL THAT
WAS GOING ON AT THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS IN RETURN FOR THE NEWS
WHICH LESTRADE WOULD BRING HOLMES WAS ALWAYS READY TO LISTEN WITH
ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS OF ANY CASE UPON WHICH THE DETECTIVE WAS
ENGAGED AND WAS ABLE OCCASIONALLY WITHOUT ANY ACTIVE INTERFERENCE
TO GIVE SOME HINT OR SUGGESTION DRAWN FROM HIS OWN VAST KNOWLEDGE AND
EXPERIENCE
ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING LESTRADE HAD SPOKEN OF THE WEATHER AND THE
NEWSPAPERS THEN HE HAD FALLEN SILENT PUFFING THOUGHTFULLY AT HIS
CIGAR HOLMES LOOKED KEENLY AT HIM
ANYTHING REMARKABLE ON HAND HE ASKED
OH NO MR HOLMES NOTHING VERY PARTICULAR
THEN TELL ME ABOUT IT
LESTRADE LAUGHED
WELL MR HOLMES THERE IS NO USE DENYING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING ON
MY MIND AND YET IT IS SUCH AN ABSURD BUSINESS THAT I HESITATED TO
BOTHER YOU ABOUT IT ON THE OTHER HAND ALTHOUGH IT IS TRIVIAL IT IS
UNDOUBTEDLY QUEER AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A TASTE FOR ALL THAT IS
OUT OF THE COMMON BUT IN MY OPINION IT COMES MORE IN DR WATSONS
LINE THAN OURS
DISEASE SAID I
MADNESS ANYHOW AND A QUEER MADNESS TOO YOU WOULDNT THINK THERE
WAS ANYONE LIVING AT THIS TIME OF DAY WHO HAD SUCH A HATRED OF
NAPOLEON THE FIRST THAT HE WOULD BREAK ANY IMAGE OF HIM THAT HE COULD
SEE
HOLMES SANK BACK IN HIS CHAIR
THATS NO BUSINESS OF MINE SAID HE
EXACTLY THATS WHAT I SAID BUT THEN WHEN THE MAN COMMITS BURGLARY
IN ORDER TO BREAK IMAGES WHICH ARE NOT HIS OWN THAT BRINGS IT AWAY
FROM THE DOCTOR AND ON TO THE POLICEMAN
HOLMES SAT UP AGAIN
BURGLARY THIS IS MORE INTERESTING LET ME HEAR THE DETAILS
LESTRADE TOOK OUT HIS OFFICIAL NOTEBOOK AND REFRESHED HIS MEMORY
FROM ITS PAGES
THE FIRST CASE REPORTED WAS FOUR DAYS AGO SAID HE IT WAS AT THE
SHOP OF MORSE HUDSON WHO HAS A PLACE FOR THE SALE OF PICTURES AND
STATUES IN THE KENNINGTON ROAD THE ASSISTANT HAD LEFT THE FRONT SHOP
FOR AN INSTANT WHEN HE HEARD A CRASH AND HURRYING IN HE FOUND A
PLASTER BUST OF NAPOLEON WHICH STOOD WITH SEVERAL OTHER WORKS OF ART
UPON THE COUNTER LYING SHIVERED INTO FRAGMENTS HE RUSHED OUT INTO
THE ROAD BUT ALTHOUGH SEVERAL PASSERSBY DECLARED THAT THEY HAD
NOTICED A MAN RUN OUT OF THE SHOP HE COULD NEITHER SEE ANYONE NOR
COULD HE FIND ANY MEANS OF IDENTIFYING THE RASCAL IT SEEMED TO BE
ONE OF THOSE SENSELESS ACTS OF HOOLIGANISM WHICH OCCUR FROM TIME TO
TIME AND IT WAS REPORTED TO THE CONSTABLE ON THE BEAT AS SUCH THE
PLASTER CAST WAS NOT WORTH MORE THAN A FEW SHILLINGS AND THE WHOLE
AFFAIR APPEARED TO BE TOO CHILDISH FOR ANY PARTICULAR INVESTIGATION
THE SECOND CASE HOWEVER WAS MORE SERIOUS AND ALSO MORE SINGULAR
IT OCCURRED ONLY LAST NIGHT
IN KENNINGTON ROAD AND WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF MORSE HUDSONS
SHOP THERE LIVES A WELLKNOWN MEDICAL PRACTITIONER NAMED DR
BARNICOT WHO HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST PRACTICES UPON THE SOUTH SIDE OF
THE THAMES HIS RESIDENCE AND PRINCIPAL CONSULTINGROOM IS AT
KENNINGTON ROAD BUT HE HAS A BRANCH SURGERY AND DISPENSARY AT LOWER
BRIXTON ROAD TWO MILES AWAY THIS DR BARNICOT IS AN ENTHUSIASTIC
ADMIRER OF NAPOLEON AND HIS HOUSE IS FULL OF BOOKS PICTURES AND
RELICS OF THE FRENCH EMPEROR SOME LITTLE TIME AGO HE PURCHASED FROM
MORSE HUDSON TWO DUPLICATE PLASTER CASTS OF THE FAMOUS HEAD OF
NAPOLEON BY THE FRENCH SCULPTOR DEVINE ONE OF THESE HE PLACED IN
HIS HALL IN THE HOUSE AT KENNINGTON ROAD AND THE OTHER ON THE
MANTELPIECE OF THE SURGERY AT LOWER BRIXTON WELL WHEN DR BARNICOT
CAME DOWN THIS MORNING HE WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT HIS HOUSE HAD
BEEN BURGLED DURING THE NIGHT BUT THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN SAVE
THE PLASTER HEAD FROM THE HALL IT HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT AND HAD BEEN
DASHED SAVAGELY AGAINST THE GARDEN WALL UNDER WHICH ITS SPLINTERED
FRAGMENTS WERE DISCOVERED
HOLMES RUBBED HIS HANDS
THIS IS CERTAINLY VERY NOVEL SAID HE
I THOUGHT IT WOULD PLEASE YOU BUT I HAVE NOT GOT TO THE END YET
DR BARNICOT WAS DUE AT HIS SURGERY AT TWELVE OCLOCK AND YOU CAN
IMAGINE HIS AMAZEMENT WHEN ON ARRIVING THERE HE FOUND THAT THE
WINDOW HAD BEEN OPENED IN THE NIGHT AND THAT THE BROKEN PIECES OF
HIS SECOND BUST WERE STREWN ALL OVER THE ROOM IT HAD BEEN SMASHED TO
ATOMS WHERE IT STOOD IN NEITHER CASE WERE THERE ANY SIGNS WHICH
COULD GIVE US A CLUE AS TO THE CRIMINAL OR LUNATIC WHO HAD DONE THE
MISCHIEF NOW MR HOLMES YOU HAVE GOT THE FACTS
THEY ARE SINGULAR NOT TO SAY GROTESQUE SAID HOLMES MAY I ASK
WHETHER THE TWO BUSTS SMASHED IN DR BARNICOTS ROOMS WERE THE EXACT
DUPLICATES OF THE ONE WHICH WAS DESTROYED IN MORSE HUDSONS SHOP
THEY WERE TAKEN FROM THE SAME MOULD
SUCH A FACT MUST TELL AGAINST THE THEORY THAT THE MAN WHO BREAKS
THEM IS INFLUENCED BY ANY GENERAL HATRED OF NAPOLEON CONSIDERING HOW
MANY HUNDREDS OF STATUES OF THE GREAT EMPEROR MUST EXIST IN LONDON
IT IS TOO MUCH TO SUPPOSE SUCH A COINCIDENCE AS THAT A PROMISCUOUS
ICONOCLAST SHOULD CHANCE TO BEGIN UPON THREE SPECIMENS OF THE SAME
BUST
WELL I THOUGHT AS YOU DO SAID LESTRADE ON THE OTHER HAND THIS
MORSE HUDSON IS THE PURVEYOR OF BUSTS IN THAT PART OF LONDON AND
THESE THREE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHICH HAD BEEN IN HIS SHOP FOR YEARS
SO ALTHOUGH AS YOU SAY THERE ARE MANY HUNDREDS OF STATUES IN
LONDON IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT THESE THREE WERE THE ONLY ONES IN
THAT DISTRICT THEREFORE A LOCAL FANATIC WOULD BEGIN WITH THEM WHAT
DO YOU THINK DR WATSON
THERE ARE NO LIMITS TO THE POSSIBILITIES OF MONOMANIA I ANSWERED
THERE IS THE CONDITION WHICH THE MODERN FRENCH PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE
CALLED THE IDE FIXE WHICH MAY BE TRIFLING IN CHARACTER AND
ACCOMPANIED BY COMPLETE SANITY IN EVERY OTHER WAY A MAN WHO HAD READ
DEEPLY ABOUT NAPOLEON OR WHO HAD POSSIBLY RECEIVED SOME HEREDITARY
FAMILY INJURY THROUGH THE GREAT WAR MIGHT CONCEIVABLY FORM SUCH AN
IDE FIXE AND UNDER ITS INFLUENCE BE CAPABLE OF ANY FANTASTIC
OUTRAGE
THAT WONT DO MY DEAR WATSON SAID HOLMES SHAKING HIS HEAD FOR
NO AMOUNT OF IDE FIXE WOULD ENABLE YOUR INTERESTING MONOMANIAC TO
FIND OUT WHERE THESE BUSTS WERE SITUATED
WELL HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN IT
I DONT ATTEMPT TO DO SO I WOULD ONLY OBSERVE THAT THERE IS A
CERTAIN METHOD IN THE GENTLEMANS ECCENTRIC PROCEEDINGS FOR EXAMPLE
IN DR BARNICOTS HALL WHERE A SOUND MIGHT AROUSE THE FAMILY THE
BUST WAS TAKEN OUTSIDE BEFORE BEING BROKEN WHEREAS IN THE SURGERY
WHERE THERE WAS LESS DANGER OF AN ALARM IT WAS SMASHED WHERE IT
STOOD THE AFFAIR SEEMS ABSURDLY TRIFLING AND YET I DARE CALL
NOTHING TRIVIAL WHEN I REFLECT THAT SOME OF MY MOST CLASSIC CASES
HAVE HAD THE LEAST PROMISING COMMENCEMENT YOU WILL REMEMBER WATSON
HOW THE DREADFUL BUSINESS OF THE ABERNETTY FAMILY WAS FIRST BROUGHT
TO MY NOTICE BY THE DEPTH WHICH THE PARSLEY HAD SUNK INTO THE BUTTER
UPON A HOT DAY I CANT AFFORD THEREFORE TO SMILE AT YOUR THREE
BROKEN BUSTS LESTRADE AND I SHALL BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU IF
YOU WILL LET ME HEAR OF ANY FRESH DEVELOPMENTS OF SO SINGULAR A CHAIN
OF EVENTS
THE DEVELOPMENT FOR WHICH MY FRIEND HAD ASKED CAME IN A QUICKER AND
AN INFINITELY MORE TRAGIC FORM THAN HE COULD HAVE IMAGINED I WAS
STILL DRESSING IN MY BEDROOM NEXT MORNING WHEN THERE WAS A TAP AT THE
DOOR AND HOLMES ENTERED A TELEGRAM IN HIS HAND HE READ IT ALOUD
COME INSTANTLY PITT STREET KENSINGTON
LESTRADE
WHAT IS IT THEN I ASKED
DONT KNOWMAY BE ANYTHING BUT I SUSPECT IT IS THE SEQUEL OF THE
STORY OF THE STATUES IN THAT CASE OUR FRIEND THE IMAGEBREAKER HAS
BEGUN OPERATIONS IN ANOTHER QUARTER OF LONDON THERES COFFEE ON THE
TABLE WATSON AND I HAVE A CAB AT THE DOOR
IN HALF AN HOUR WE HAD REACHED PITT STREET A QUIET LITTLE BACKWATER
JUST BESIDE ONE OF THE BRISKEST CURRENTS OF LONDON LIFE NO WAS
ONE OF A ROW ALL FLATCHESTED RESPECTABLE AND MOST UNROMANTIC
DWELLINGS AS WE DROVE UP WE FOUND THE RAILINGS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE
LINED BY A CURIOUS CROWD HOLMES WHISTLED
BY GEORGE ITS ATTEMPTED MURDER AT THE LEAST NOTHING LESS WILL
HOLD THE LONDON MESSAGEBOY THERES A DEED OF VIOLENCE INDICATED IN
THAT FELLOWS ROUND SHOULDERS AND OUTSTRETCHED NECK WHATS THIS
WATSON THE TOP STEPS SWILLED DOWN AND THE OTHER ONES DRY FOOTSTEPS
ENOUGH ANYHOW WELL WELL THERES LESTRADE AT THE FRONT WINDOW AND
WE SHALL SOON KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
THE OFFICIAL RECEIVED US WITH A VERY GRAVE FACE AND SHOWED US INTO A
SITTINGROOM WHERE AN EXCEEDINGLY UNKEMPT AND AGITATED ELDERLY MAN
CLAD IN A FLANNEL DRESSINGGOWN WAS PACING UP AND DOWN HE WAS
INTRODUCED TO US AS THE OWNER OF THE HOUSEMR HORACE HARKER OF THE
CENTRAL PRESS SYNDICATE
ITS THE NAPOLEON BUST BUSINESS AGAIN SAID LESTRADE YOU SEEMED
INTERESTED LAST NIGHT MR HOLMES SO I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU WOULD BE
GLAD TO BE PRESENT NOW THAT THE AFFAIR HAS TAKEN A VERY MUCH GRAVER
TURN
WHAT HAS IT TURNED TO THEN
TO MURDER MR HARKER WILL YOU TELL THESE GENTLEMEN EXACTLY WHAT
HAS OCCURRED
THE MAN IN THE DRESSINGGOWN TURNED UPON US WITH A MOST MELANCHOLY
FACE
ITS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING SAID HE THAT ALL MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN
COLLECTING OTHER PEOPLES NEWS AND NOW THAT A REAL PIECE OF NEWS HAS
COME MY OWN WAY I AM SO CONFUSED AND BOTHERED THAT I CANT PUT TWO
WORDS TOGETHER IF I HAD COME IN HERE AS A JOURNALIST I SHOULD HAVE
INTERVIEWED MYSELF AND HAD TWO COLUMNS IN EVERY EVENING PAPER AS IT
IS I AM GIVING AWAY VALUABLE COPY BY TELLING MY STORY OVER AND OVER
TO A STRING OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND I CAN MAKE NO USE OF IT MYSELF
HOWEVER IVE HEARD YOUR NAME MR SHERLOCK HOLMES AND IF YOULL
ONLY EXPLAIN THIS QUEER BUSINESS I SHALL BE PAID FOR MY TROUBLE IN
TELLING YOU THE STORY
HOLMES SAT DOWN AND LISTENED
IT ALL SEEMS TO CENTRE ROUND THAT BUST OF NAPOLEON WHICH I BOUGHT
FOR THIS VERY ROOM ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO I PICKED IT UP CHEAP FROM
HARDING BROTHERS TWO DOORS FROM THE HIGH STREET STATION A GREAT
DEAL OF MY JOURNALISTIC WORK IS DONE AT NIGHT AND I OFTEN WRITE
UNTIL THE EARLY MORNING SO IT WAS TODAY I WAS SITTING IN MY DEN
WHICH IS AT THE BACK OF THE TOP OF THE HOUSE ABOUT THREE OCLOCK
WHEN I WAS CONVINCED THAT I HEARD SOME SOUNDS DOWNSTAIRS I LISTENED
BUT THEY WERE NOT REPEATED AND I CONCLUDED THAT THEY CAME FROM
OUTSIDE THEN SUDDENLY ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LATER THERE CAME A MOST
HORRIBLE YELLTHE MOST DREADFUL SOUND MR HOLMES THAT EVER I
HEARD IT WILL RING IN MY EARS AS LONG AS I LIVE I SAT FROZEN WITH
HORROR FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN I SEIZED THE POKER AND WENT
DOWNSTAIRS WHEN I ENTERED THIS ROOM I FOUND THE WINDOW WIDE OPEN
AND I AT ONCE OBSERVED THAT THE BUST WAS GONE FROM THE MANTELPIECE
WHY ANY BURGLAR SHOULD TAKE SUCH A THING PASSES MY UNDERSTANDING FOR
IT WAS ONLY A PLASTER CAST AND OF NO REAL VALUE WHATEVER
YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF THAT ANYONE GOING OUT THROUGH THAT OPEN
WINDOW COULD REACH THE FRONT DOORSTEP BY TAKING A LONG STRIDE THIS
WAS CLEARLY WHAT THE BURGLAR HAD DONE SO I WENT ROUND AND OPENED THE
DOOR STEPPING OUT INTO THE DARK I NEARLY FELL OVER A DEAD MAN WHO
WAS LYING THERE I RAN BACK FOR A LIGHT AND THERE WAS THE POOR
FELLOW A GREAT GASH IN HIS THROAT AND THE WHOLE PLACE SWIMMING IN
BLOOD HE LAY ON HIS BACK HIS KNEES DRAWN UP AND HIS MOUTH HORRIBLY
OPEN I SHALL SEE HIM IN MY DREAMS I HAD JUST TIME TO BLOW ON MY
POLICEWHISTLE AND THEN I MUST HAVE FAINTED FOR I KNEW NOTHING MORE
UNTIL I FOUND THE POLICEMAN STANDING OVER ME IN THE HALL
WELL WHO WAS THE MURDERED MAN ASKED HOLMES
THERES NOTHING TO SHOW WHO HE WAS SAID LESTRADE YOU SHALL SEE
THE BODY AT THE MORTUARY BUT WE HAVE MADE NOTHING OF IT UP TO NOW
HE IS A TALL MAN SUNBURNED VERY POWERFUL NOT MORE THAN THIRTY HE
IS POORLY DRESSED AND YET DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A LABOURER A
HORNHANDLED CLASP KNIFE WAS LYING IN A POOL OF BLOOD BESIDE HIM
WHETHER IT WAS THE WEAPON WHICH DID THE DEED OR WHETHER IT BELONGED
TO THE DEAD MAN I DO NOT KNOW THERE WAS NO NAME ON HIS CLOTHING
AND NOTHING IN HIS POCKETS SAVE AN APPLE SOME STRING A SHILLING MAP
OF LONDON AND A PHOTOGRAPH HERE IT IS
IT WAS EVIDENTLY TAKEN BY A SNAPSHOT FROM A SMALL CAMERA IT
REPRESENTED AN ALERT SHARPFEATURED SIMIAN MAN WITH THICK EYEBROWS
AND A VERY PECULIAR PROJECTION OF THE LOWER PART OF THE FACE LIKE THE
MUZZLE OF A BABOON
AND WHAT BECAME OF THE BUST ASKED HOLMES AFTER A CAREFUL STUDY OF
THIS PICTURE
WE HAD NEWS OF IT JUST BEFORE YOU CAME IT HAS BEEN FOUND IN THE
FRONT GARDEN OF AN EMPTY HOUSE IN CAMPDEN HOUSE ROAD IT WAS BROKEN
INTO FRAGMENTS I AM GOING ROUND NOW TO SEE IT WILL YOU COME
CERTAINLY I MUST JUST TAKE ONE LOOK ROUND HE EXAMINED THE CARPET
AND THE WINDOW THE FELLOW HAD EITHER VERY LONG LEGS OR WAS A MOST
ACTIVE MAN SAID HE WITH AN AREA BENEATH IT WAS NO MEAN FEAT TO
REACH THAT WINDOWLEDGE AND OPEN THAT WINDOW GETTING BACK WAS
COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE ARE YOU COMING WITH US TO SEE THE REMAINS OF
YOUR BUST MR HARKER
THE DISCONSOLATE JOURNALIST HAD SEATED HIMSELF AT A WRITINGTABLE
I MUST TRY AND MAKE SOMETHING OF IT SAID HE THOUGH I HAVE NO
DOUBT THAT THE FIRST EDITIONS OF THE EVENING PAPERS ARE OUT ALREADY
WITH FULL DETAILS ITS LIKE MY LUCK YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE STAND
FELL AT DONCASTER WELL I WAS THE ONLY JOURNALIST IN THE STAND AND
MY JOURNAL THE ONLY ONE THAT HAD NO ACCOUNT OF IT FOR I WAS TOO
SHAKEN TO WRITE IT AND NOW ILL BE TOO LATE WITH A MURDER DONE ON MY
OWN DOORSTEP
AS WE LEFT THE ROOM WE HEARD HIS PEN TRAVELLING SHRILLY OVER THE
FOOLSCAP
THE SPOT WHERE THE FRAGMENTS OF THE BUST HAD BEEN FOUND WAS ONLY A
FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FOR THE FIRST TIME OUR EYES RESTED UPON THIS
PRESENTMENT OF THE GREAT EMPEROR WHICH SEEMED TO RAISE SUCH FRANTIC
AND DESTRUCTIVE HATRED IN THE MIND OF THE UNKNOWN IT LAY SCATTERED
IN SPLINTERED SHARDS UPON THE GRASS HOLMES PICKED UP SEVERAL OF THEM
AND EXAMINED THEM CAREFULLY I WAS CONVINCED FROM HIS INTENT FACE AND
HIS PURPOSEFUL MANNER THAT AT LAST HE WAS UPON A CLUE
WELL ASKED LESTRADE
HOLMES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO YET SAID HE AND YETAND YETWELL WE
HAVE SOME SUGGESTIVE FACTS TO ACT UPON THE POSSESSION OF THIS
TRIFLING BUST WAS WORTH MORE IN THE EYES OF THIS STRANGE CRIMINAL
THAN A HUMAN LIFE THAT IS ONE POINT THEN THERE IS THE SINGULAR FACT
THAT HE DID NOT BREAK IT IN THE HOUSE OR IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE
HOUSE IF TO BREAK IT WAS HIS SOLE OBJECT
HE WAS RATTLED AND BUSTLED BY MEETING THIS OTHER FELLOW HE HARDLY
KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING
WELL THATS LIKELY ENOUGH BUT I WISH TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION VERY
PARTICULARLY TO THE POSITION OF THIS HOUSE IN THE GARDEN OF WHICH THE
BUST WAS DESTROYED
LESTRADE LOOKED ABOUT HIM
IT WAS AN EMPTY HOUSE AND SO HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOT BE DISTURBED
IN THE GARDEN
YES BUT THERE IS ANOTHER EMPTY HOUSE FARTHER UP THE STREET WHICH HE
MUST HAVE PASSED BEFORE HE CAME TO THIS ONE WHY DID HE NOT BREAK IT
THERE SINCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT EVERY YARD THAT HE CARRIED IT
INCREASED THE RISK OF SOMEONE MEETING HIM
I GIVE IT UP SAID LESTRADE
HOLMES POINTED TO THE STREET LAMP ABOVE OUR HEADS
HE COULD SEE WHAT HE WAS DOING HERE AND HE COULD NOT THERE THAT WAS
HIS REASON
BY JOVE THATS TRUE SAID THE DETECTIVE NOW THAT I COME TO THINK
OF IT DR BARNICOTS BUST WAS BROKEN NOT FAR FROM HIS RED LAMP
WELL MR HOLMES WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH THAT FACT
TO REMEMBER ITTO DOCKET IT WE MAY COME ON SOMETHING LATER WHICH
WILL BEAR UPON IT WHAT STEPS DO YOU PROPOSE TO TAKE NOW LESTRADE
THE MOST PRACTICAL WAY OF GETTING AT IT IN MY OPINION IS TO
IDENTIFY THE DEAD MAN THERE SHOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT THAT WHEN
WE HAVE FOUND WHO HE IS AND WHO HIS ASSOCIATES ARE WE SHOULD HAVE A
GOOD START IN LEARNING WHAT HE WAS DOING IN PITT STREET LAST NIGHT
AND WHO IT WAS WHO MET HIM AND KILLED HIM ON THE DOORSTEP OF MR
HORACE HARKER DONT YOU THINK SO
NO DOUBT AND YET IT IS NOT QUITE THE WAY IN WHICH I SHOULD APPROACH
THE CASE
WHAT WOULD YOU DO THEN
OH YOU MUST NOT LET ME INFLUENCE YOU IN ANY WAY I SUGGEST THAT YOU
GO ON YOUR LINE AND I ON MINE WE CAN COMPARE NOTES AFTERWARDS AND
EACH WILL SUPPLEMENT THE OTHER
VERY GOOD SAID LESTRADE
IF YOU ARE GOING BACK TO PITT STREET YOU MIGHT SEE MR HORACE
HARKER TELL HIM FROM ME THAT I HAVE QUITE MADE UP MY MIND AND THAT
IT IS CERTAIN THAT A DANGEROUS HOMICIDAL LUNATIC WITH NAPOLEONIC
DELUSIONS WAS IN HIS HOUSE LAST NIGHT IT WILL BE USEFUL FOR HIS
ARTICLE
LESTRADE STARED
YOU DONT SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT
HOLMES SMILED
DONT I WELL PERHAPS I DONT BUT I AM SURE THAT IT WILL INTEREST
MR HORACE HARKER AND THE SUBSCRIBERS OF THE CENTRAL PRESS SYNDICATE
NOW WATSON I THINK THAT WE SHALL FIND THAT WE HAVE A LONG AND
RATHER COMPLEX DAYS WORK BEFORE US I SHOULD BE GLAD LESTRADE IF
YOU COULD MAKE IT CONVENIENT TO MEET US AT BAKER STREET AT SIX
OCLOCK THIS EVENING UNTIL THEN I SHOULD LIKE TO KEEP THIS
PHOTOGRAPH FOUND IN THE DEAD MANS POCKET IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY
HAVE TO ASK YOUR COMPANY AND ASSISTANCE UPON A SMALL EXPEDITION WHICH
WILL HAVE BE UNDERTAKEN TONIGHT IF MY CHAIN OF REASONING SHOULD
PROVE TO BE CORRECT UNTIL THEN GOODBYE AND GOOD LUCK
SHERLOCK HOLMES AND I WALKED TOGETHER TO THE HIGH STREET WHERE HE
STOPPED AT THE SHOP OF HARDING BROTHERS WHENCE THE BUST HAD BEEN
PURCHASED A YOUNG ASSISTANT INFORMED US THAT MR HARDING WOULD BE
ABSENT UNTIL AFTER NOON AND THAT HE WAS HIMSELF A NEWCOMER WHO COULD
GIVE US NO INFORMATION HOLMESS FACE SHOWED HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AND
ANNOYANCE
WELL WELL WE CANT EXPECT TO HAVE IT ALL OUR OWN WAY WATSON HE
SAID AT LAST WE MUST COME BACK IN THE AFTERNOON IF MR HARDING
WILL NOT BE HERE UNTIL THEN I AM AS YOU HAVE NO DOUBT SURMISED
ENDEAVOURING TO TRACE THESE BUSTS TO THEIR SOURCE IN ORDER TO FIND
IF THERE IS NOT SOMETHING PECULIAR WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR THEIR
REMARKABLE FATE LET US MAKE FOR MR MORSE HUDSON OF THE KENNINGTON
ROAD AND SEE IF HE CAN THROW ANY LIGHT UPON THE PROBLEM
A DRIVE OF AN HOUR BROUGHT US TO THE PICTUREDEALERS ESTABLISHMENT
HE WAS A SMALL STOUT MAN WITH A RED FACE AND A PEPPERY MANNER
YES SIR ON MY VERY COUNTER SIR SAID HE WHAT WE PAY RATES AND
TAXES FOR I DONT KNOW WHEN ANY RUFFIAN CAN COME IN AND BREAK ONES
GOODS YES SIR IT WAS I WHO SOLD DR BARNICOT HIS TWO STATUES
DISGRACEFUL SIR A NIHILIST PLOT THATS WHAT I MAKE IT NO ONE BUT
AN ANARCHIST WOULD GO ABOUT BREAKING STATUES RED REPUBLICANS THATS
WHAT I CALL EM WHO DID I GET THE STATUES FROM I DONT SEE WHAT
THAT HAS TO DO WITH IT WELL IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW I GOT THEM
FROM GELDER CO IN CHURCH STREET STEPNEY THEY ARE A WELLKNOWN
HOUSE IN THE TRADE AND HAVE BEEN THIS TWENTY YEARS HOW MANY HAD I
THREETWO AND ONE ARE THREETWO OF DR BARNICOTS AND ONE SMASHED
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT ON MY OWN COUNTER DO I KNOW THAT PHOTOGRAPH NO I
DONT YES I DO THOUGH WHY ITS BEPPO HE WAS A KIND OF ITALIAN
PIECEWORK MAN WHO MADE HIMSELF USEFUL IN THE SHOP HE COULD CARVE A
BIT AND GILD AND FRAME AND DO ODD JOBS THE FELLOW LEFT ME LAST
WEEK AND IVE HEARD NOTHING OF HIM SINCE NO I DONT KNOW WHERE HE
CAME FROM NOR WHERE HE WENT TO I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST HIM WHILE HE
WAS HERE HE WAS GONE TWO DAYS BEFORE THE BUST WAS SMASHED
WELL THATS ALL WE COULD REASONABLY EXPECT TO GET FROM MORSE
HUDSON SAID HOLMES AS WE EMERGED FROM THE SHOP WE HAVE THIS
BEPPO AS A COMMON FACTOR BOTH IN KENNINGTON AND IN KENSINGTON SO
THAT IS WORTH A TENMILE DRIVE NOW WATSON LET US MAKE FOR GELDER CO OF
STEPNEY THE SOURCE AND ORIGIN OF BUSTS I SHALL BE SURPRISED
IF WE DONT GET SOME HELP DOWN THERE
IN RAPID SUCCESSION WE PASSED THROUGH THE FRINGE OF FASHIONABLE
LONDON HOTEL LONDON THEATRICAL LONDON LITERARY LONDON COMMERCIAL
LONDON AND FINALLY MARITIME LONDON TILL WE CAME TO A RIVERSIDE
CITY OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS WHERE THE TENEMENT HOUSES SWELTER
AND REEK WITH THE OUTCASTS OF EUROPE HERE IN A BROAD THOROUGHFARE
ONCE THE ABODE OF WEALTHY CITY MERCHANTS WE FOUND THE SCULPTURE
WORKS FOR WHICH WE SEARCHED OUTSIDE WAS A CONSIDERABLE YARD FULL OF
MONUMENTAL MASONRY INSIDE WAS A LARGE ROOM IN WHICH FIFTY WORKERS
WERE CARVING OR MOULDING THE MANAGER A BIG BLOND GERMAN RECEIVED
US CIVILLY AND GAVE A CLEAR ANSWER TO ALL HOLMESS QUESTIONS A
REFERENCE TO HIS BOOKS SHOWED THAT HUNDREDS OF CASTS HAD BEEN TAKEN
FROM A MARBLE COPY OF DEVINES HEAD OF NAPOLEON BUT THAT THE THREE
WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO MORSE HUDSON A YEAR OR SO BEFORE HAD BEEN HALF
OF A BATCH OF SIX THE OTHER THREE BEING SENT TO HARDING BROTHERS OF
KENSINGTON THERE WAS NO REASON WHY THOSE SIX SHOULD BE DIFFERENT TO
ANY OF THE OTHER CASTS HE COULD SUGGEST NO POSSIBLE CAUSE WHY ANYONE
SHOULD WISH TO DESTROY THEMIN FACT HE LAUGHED AT THE IDEA THEIR
WHOLESALE PRICE WAS SIX SHILLINGS BUT THE RETAILER WOULD GET TWELVE
OR MORE THE CAST WAS TAKEN IN TWO MOULDS FROM EACH SIDE OF THE FACE
AND THEN THESE TWO PROFILES OF PLASTER OF PARIS WERE JOINED TOGETHER
TO MAKE THE COMPLETE BUST THE WORK WAS USUALLY DONE BY ITALIANS IN
THE ROOM WE WERE IN WHEN FINISHED THE BUSTS WERE PUT ON A TABLE IN
THE PASSAGE TO DRY AND AFTERWARDS STORED THAT WAS ALL HE COULD TELL
US
BUT THE PRODUCTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH HAD A REMARKABLE EFFECT UPON THE
MANAGER HIS FACE FLUSHED WITH ANGER AND HIS BROWS KNOTTED OVER HIS
BLUE TEUTONIC EYES
AH THE RASCAL HE CRIED YES INDEED I KNOW HIM VERY WELL THIS
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A RESPECTABLE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE ONLY TIME THAT
WE HAVE EVER HAD THE POLICE IN IT WAS OVER THIS VERY FELLOW IT WAS
MORE THAN A YEAR AGO NOW HE KNIFED ANOTHER ITALIAN IN THE STREET
AND THEN HE CAME TO THE WORKS WITH THE POLICE ON HIS HEELS AND HE
WAS TAKEN HERE BEPPO WAS HIS NAMEHIS SECOND NAME I NEVER KNEW
SERVE ME RIGHT FOR ENGAGING A MAN WITH SUCH A FACE BUT HE WAS A GOOD
WORKMAN ONE OF THE BEST
WHAT DID HE GET
THE MAN LIVED AND HE GOT OFF WITH A YEAR I HAVE NO DOUBT HE IS OUT
NOW BUT HE HAS NOT DARED TO SHOW HIS NOSE HERE WE HAVE A COUSIN OF
HIS HERE AND I DARE SAY HE COULD TELL YOU WHERE HE IS
NO NO CRIED HOLMES NOT A WORD TO THE COUSINNOT A WORD I BEG
YOU THE MATTER IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THE FARTHER I GO WITH IT THE
MORE IMPORTANT IT SEEMS TO GROW WHEN YOU REFERRED IN YOUR LEDGER TO
THE SALE OF THOSE CASTS I OBSERVED THAT THE DATE WAS JUNE RD OF LAST
YEAR COULD YOU GIVE ME THE DATE WHEN BEPPO WAS ARRESTED
I COULD TELL YOU ROUGHLY BY THE PAYLIST THE MANAGER ANSWERED
YES HE CONTINUED AFTER SOME TURNING OVER OF PAGES HE WAS PAID
LAST ON MAY TH
THANK YOU SAID HOLMES I DONT THINK THAT I NEED INTRUDE UPON
YOUR TIME AND PATIENCE ANY MORE WITH A LAST WORD OF CAUTION THAT HE
SHOULD SAY NOTHING AS TO OUR RESEARCHES WE TURNED OUR FACES WESTWARD
ONCE MORE
THE AFTERNOON WAS FAR ADVANCED BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO SNATCH A HASTY
LUNCHEON AT A RESTAURANT A NEWSBILL AT THE ENTRANCE ANNOUNCED
KENSINGTON OUTRAGE MURDER BY A MADMAN AND THE CONTENTS OF THE
PAPER SHOWED THAT MR HORACE HARKER HAD GOT HIS ACCOUNT INTO PRINT
AFTER ALL TWO COLUMNS WERE OCCUPIED WITH A HIGHLY SENSATIONAL AND
FLOWERY RENDERING OF THE WHOLE INCIDENT HOLMES PROPPED IT AGAINST
THE CRUETSTAND AND READ IT WHILE HE ATE ONCE OR TWICE HE CHUCKLED
THIS IS ALL RIGHT WATSON SAID HE LISTEN TO THIS
IT IS SATISFACTORY TO KNOW THAT THERE CAN BE NO DIFFERENCE OF
OPINION UPON THIS CASE SINCE MR LESTRADE ONE OF THE MOST
EXPERIENCED MEMBERS OF THE OFFICIAL FORCE AND MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
THE WELLKNOWN CONSULTING EXPERT HAVE EACH COME TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT THE GROTESQUE SERIES OF INCIDENTS WHICH HAVE ENDED IN SO TRAGIC
A FASHION ARISE FROM LUNACY RATHER THAN FROM DELIBERATE CRIME NO
EXPLANATION SAVE MENTAL ABERRATION CAN COVER THE FACTS
THE PRESS WATSON IS A MOST VALUABLE INSTITUTION IF YOU ONLY KNOW
HOW TO USE IT AND NOW IF YOU HAVE QUITE FINISHED WE WILL HARK BACK
TO KENSINGTON AND SEE WHAT THE MANAGER OF HARDING BROTHERS HAS TO SAY
TO THE MATTER
THE FOUNDER OF THAT GREAT EMPORIUM PROVED TO BE A BRISK CRISP LITTLE
PERSON VERY DAPPER AND QUICK WITH A CLEAR HEAD AND A READY TONGUE
YES SIR I HAVE ALREADY READ THE ACCOUNT IN THE EVENING PAPERS MR
HORACE HARKER IS A CUSTOMER OF OURS WE SUPPLIED HIM WITH THE BUST
SOME MONTHS AGO WE ORDERED THREE BUSTS OF THAT SORT FROM GELDER CO OF
STEPNEY THEY ARE ALL SOLD NOW TO WHOM OH I DARE SAY BY
CONSULTING OUR SALES BOOK WE COULD VERY EASILY TELL YOU YES WE HAVE
THE ENTRIES HERE ONE TO MR HARKER YOU SEE AND ONE TO MR JOSIAH
BROWN OF LABURNUM LODGE LABURNUM VALE CHISWICK AND ONE TO MR
SANDEFORD OF LOWER GROVE ROAD READING NO I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS
FACE WHICH YOU SHOW ME IN THE PHOTOGRAPH YOU WOULD HARDLY FORGET IT
WOULD YOU SIR FOR IVE SELDOM SEEN AN UGLIER HAVE WE ANY ITALIANS
ON THE STAFF YES SIR WE HAVE SEVERAL AMONG OUR WORKPEOPLE AND
CLEANERS I DARE SAY THEY MIGHT GET A PEEP AT THAT SALES BOOK IF THEY
WANTED TO THERE IS NO PARTICULAR REASON FOR KEEPING A WATCH UPON
THAT BOOK WELL WELL ITS A VERY STRANGE BUSINESS AND I HOPE THAT
YOULL LET ME KNOW IF ANYTHING COMES OF YOUR INQUIRIES
HOLMES HAD TAKEN SEVERAL NOTES DURING MR HARDINGS EVIDENCE AND I
COULD SEE THAT HE WAS THOROUGHLY SATISFIED BY THE TURN WHICH AFFAIRS
WERE TAKING HE MADE NO REMARK HOWEVER SAVE THAT UNLESS WE
HURRIED WE SHOULD BE LATE FOR OUR APPOINTMENT WITH LESTRADE SURE
ENOUGH WHEN WE REACHED BAKER STREET THE DETECTIVE WAS ALREADY THERE
AND WE FOUND HIM PACING UP AND DOWN IN A FEVER OF IMPATIENCE HIS
LOOK OF IMPORTANCE SHOWED THAT HIS DAYS WORK HAD NOT BEEN IN VAIN
WELL HE ASKED WHAT LUCK MR HOLMES
WE HAVE HAD A VERY BUSY DAY AND NOT ENTIRELY A WASTED ONE MY
FRIEND EXPLAINED WE HAVE SEEN BOTH THE RETAILERS AND ALSO THE
WHOLESALE MANUFACTURERS I CAN TRACE EACH OF THE BUSTS NOW FROM THE
BEGINNING
THE BUSTS CRIED LESTRADE WELL WELL YOU HAVE YOUR OWN METHODS
MR SHERLOCK HOLMES AND IT IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY A WORD AGAINST THEM
BUT I THINK I HAVE DONE A BETTER DAYS WORK THAN YOU I HAVE
IDENTIFIED THE DEAD MAN
YOU DONT SAY SO
AND FOUND A CAUSE FOR THE CRIME
SPLENDID
WE HAVE AN INSPECTOR WHO MAKES A SPECIALTY OF SAFFRON HILL AND THE
ITALIAN QUARTER WELL THIS DEAD MAN HAD SOME CATHOLIC EMBLEM ROUND
HIS NECK AND THAT ALONG WITH HIS COLOUR MADE ME THINK HE WAS FROM
THE SOUTH INSPECTOR HILL KNEW HIM THE MOMENT HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
HIS NAME IS PIETRO VENUCCI FROM NAPLES AND HE IS ONE OF THE
GREATEST CUTTHROATS IN LONDON HE IS CONNECTED WITH THE MAFIA
WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS A SECRET POLITICAL SOCIETY ENFORCING ITS
DECREES BY MURDER NOW YOU SEE HOW THE AFFAIR BEGINS TO CLEAR UP THE
OTHER FELLOW IS PROBABLY AN ITALIAN ALSO AND A MEMBER OF THE MAFIA
HE HAS BROKEN THE RULES IN SOME FASHION PIETRO IS SET UPON HIS
TRACK PROBABLY THE PHOTOGRAPH WE FOUND IN HIS POCKET IS THE MAN
HIMSELF SO THAT HE MAY NOT KNIFE THE WRONG PERSON HE DOGS THE
FELLOW HE SEES HIM ENTER A HOUSE HE WAITS OUTSIDE FOR HIM AND IN
THE SCUFFLE HE RECEIVES HIS OWN DEATHWOUND HOW IS THAT MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES
HOLMES CLAPPED HIS HANDS APPROVINGLY
EXCELLENT LESTRADE EXCELLENT HE CRIED BUT I DIDNT QUITE
FOLLOW YOUR EXPLANATION OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BUSTS
THE BUSTS YOU NEVER CAN GET THOSE BUSTS OUT OF YOUR HEAD AFTER
ALL THAT IS NOTHING PETTY LARCENY SIX MONTHS AT THE MOST IT IS
THE MURDER THAT WE ARE REALLY INVESTIGATING AND I TELL YOU THAT I AM
GATHERING ALL THE THREADS INTO MY HANDS
AND THE NEXT STAGE
IS A VERY SIMPLE ONE I SHALL GO DOWN WITH HILL TO THE ITALIAN
QUARTER FIND THE MAN WHOSE PHOTOGRAPH WE HAVE GOT AND ARREST HIM ON
THE CHARGE OF MURDER WILL YOU COME WITH US
I THINK NOT I FANCY WE CAN ATTAIN OUR END IN A SIMPLER WAY I CANT
SAY FOR CERTAIN BECAUSE IT ALL DEPENDSWELL IT ALL DEPENDS UPON A
FACTOR WHICH IS COMPLETELY OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL BUT I HAVE GREAT
HOPESIN FACT THE BETTING IS EXACTLY TWO TO ONETHAT IF YOU WILL
COME WITH US TONIGHT I SHALL BE ABLE TO HELP YOU TO LAY HIM BY THE
HEELS
IN THE ITALIAN QUARTER
NO I FANCY CHISWICK IS AN ADDRESS WHICH IS MORE LIKELY TO FIND HIM
IF YOU WILL COME WITH ME TO CHISWICK TONIGHT LESTRADE ILL PROMISE
TO GO TO THE ITALIAN QUARTER WITH YOU TOMORROW AND NO HARM WILL BE
DONE BY THE DELAY AND NOW I THINK THAT A FEW HOURS SLEEP WOULD DO
US ALL GOOD FOR I DO NOT PROPOSE TO LEAVE BEFORE ELEVEN OCLOCK AND
IT IS UNLIKELY THAT WE SHALL BE BACK BEFORE MORNING YOULL DINE WITH
US LESTRADE AND THEN YOU ARE WELCOME TO THE SOFA UNTIL IT IS TIME
FOR US TO START IN THE MEANTIME WATSON I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU
WOULD RING FOR AN EXPRESS MESSENGER FOR I HAVE A LETTER TO SEND AND
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IT SHOULD GO AT ONCE
HOLMES SPENT THE EVENING IN RUMMAGING AMONG THE FILES OF THE OLD
DAILY PAPERS WITH WHICH ONE OF OUR LUMBERROOMS WAS PACKED WHEN AT
LAST HE DESCENDED IT WAS WITH TRIUMPH IN HIS EYES BUT HE SAID
NOTHING TO EITHER OF US AS TO THE RESULT OF HIS RESEARCHES FOR MY
OWN PART I HAD FOLLOWED STEP BY STEP THE METHODS BY WHICH HE HAD
TRACED THE VARIOUS WINDINGS OF THIS COMPLEX CASE AND THOUGH I COULD
NOT YET PERCEIVE THE GOAL WHICH WE WOULD REACH I UNDERSTOOD CLEARLY
THAT HOLMES EXPECTED THIS GROTESQUE CRIMINAL TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT UPON
THE TWO REMAINING BUSTS ONE OF WHICH I REMEMBERED WAS AT CHISWICK
NO DOUBT THE OBJECT OF OUR JOURNEY WAS TO CATCH HIM IN THE VERY ACT
AND I COULD NOT BUT ADMIRE THE CUNNING WITH WHICH MY FRIEND HAD
INSERTED A WRONG CLUE IN THE EVENING PAPER SO AS TO GIVE THE FELLOW
THE IDEA THAT HE COULD CONTINUE HIS SCHEME WITH IMPUNITY I WAS NOT
SURPRISED WHEN HOLMES SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD TAKE MY REVOLVER WITH
ME HE HAD HIMSELF PICKED UP THE LOADED HUNTINGCROP WHICH WAS HIS
FAVOURITE WEAPON
A FOURWHEELER WAS AT THE DOOR AT ELEVEN AND IN IT WE DROVE TO A
SPOT AT THE OTHER SIDE OF HAMMERSMITH BRIDGE HERE THE CABMAN WAS
DIRECTED TO WAIT A SHORT WALK BROUGHT US TO A SECLUDED ROAD FRINGED
WITH PLEASANT HOUSES EACH STANDING IN ITS OWN GROUNDS IN THE LIGHT
OF A STREET LAMP WE READ LABURNUM VILLA UPON THE GATEPOST OF ONE
OF THEM THE OCCUPANTS HAD EVIDENTLY RETIRED TO REST FOR ALL WAS
DARK SAVE FOR A FANLIGHT OVER THE HALL DOOR WHICH SHED A SINGLE
BLURRED CIRCLE ON TO THE GARDEN PATH THE WOODEN FENCE WHICH
SEPARATED THE GROUNDS FROM THE ROAD THREW A DENSE BLACK SHADOW UPON
THE INNER SIDE AND HERE IT WAS THAT WE CROUCHED
I FEAR THAT YOULL HAVE A LONG WAIT HOLMES WHISPERED WE MAY
THANK OUR STARS THAT IT IS NOT RAINING I DONT THINK WE CAN EVEN
VENTURE TO SMOKE TO PASS THE TIME HOWEVER ITS A TWO TO ONE CHANCE
THAT WE GET SOMETHING TO PAY US FOR OUR TROUBLE
IT PROVED HOWEVER THAT OUR VIGIL WAS NOT TO BE SO LONG AS HOLMES
HAD LED US TO FEAR AND IT ENDED IN A VERY SUDDEN AND SINGULAR
FASHION IN AN INSTANT WITHOUT THE LEAST SOUND TO WARN US OF HIS
COMING THE GARDEN GATE SWUNG OPEN AND A LITHE DARK FIGURE AS
SWIFT AND ACTIVE AS AN APE RUSHED UP THE GARDEN PATH WE SAW IT
WHISK PAST THE LIGHT THROWN FROM OVER THE DOOR AND DISAPPEAR AGAINST
THE BLACK SHADOW OF THE HOUSE THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE DURING WHICH
WE HELD OUR BREATH AND THEN A VERY GENTLE CREAKING SOUND CAME TO OUR
EARS THE WINDOW WAS BEING OPENED THE NOISE CEASED AND AGAIN THERE
WAS A LONG SILENCE THE FELLOW WAS MAKING HIS WAY INTO THE HOUSE WE
SAW THE SUDDEN FLASH OF A DARK LANTERN INSIDE THE ROOM WHAT HE
SOUGHT WAS EVIDENTLY NOT THERE FOR AGAIN WE SAW THE FLASH THROUGH
ANOTHER BLIND AND THEN THROUGH ANOTHER
LET US GET TO THE OPEN WINDOW WE WILL NAB HIM AS HE CLIMBS OUT
LESTRADE WHISPERED
BUT BEFORE WE COULD MOVE THE MAN HAD EMERGED AGAIN AS HE CAME OUT
INTO THE GLIMMERING PATCH OF LIGHT WE SAW THAT HE CARRIED SOMETHING
WHITE UNDER HIS ARM HE LOOKED STEALTHILY ALL ROUND HIM THE SILENCE
OF THE DESERTED STREET REASSURED HIM TURNING HIS BACK UPON US HE
LAID DOWN HIS BURDEN AND THE NEXT INSTANT THERE WAS THE SOUND OF A
SHARP TAP FOLLOWED BY A CLATTER AND RATTLE THE MAN WAS SO INTENT
UPON WHAT HE WAS DOING THAT HE NEVER HEARD OUR STEPS AS WE STOLE
ACROSS THE GRASS PLOT WITH THE BOUND OF A TIGER HOLMES WAS ON HIS
BACK AND AN INSTANT LATER LESTRADE AND I HAD HIM BY EITHER WRIST AND
THE HANDCUFFS HAD BEEN FASTENED AS WE TURNED HIM OVER I SAW A
HIDEOUS SALLOW FACE WITH WRITHING FURIOUS FEATURES GLARING UP AT
US AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS INDEED THE MAN OF THE PHOTOGRAPH WHOM WE
HAD SECURED
BUT IT WAS NOT OUR PRISONER TO WHOM HOLMES WAS GIVING HIS ATTENTION
SQUATTED ON THE DOORSTEP HE WAS ENGAGED IN MOST CAREFULLY EXAMINING
THAT WHICH THE MAN HAD BROUGHT FROM THE HOUSE IT WAS A BUST OF
NAPOLEON LIKE THE ONE WHICH WE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING AND IT HAD BEEN
BROKEN INTO SIMILAR FRAGMENTS CAREFULLY HOLMES HELD EACH SEPARATE
SHARD TO THE LIGHT BUT IN NO WAY DID IT DIFFER FROM ANY OTHER
SHATTERED PIECE OF PLASTER HE HAD JUST COMPLETED HIS EXAMINATION
WHEN THE HALL LIGHTS FLEW UP THE DOOR OPENED AND THE OWNER OF THE
HOUSE A JOVIAL ROTUND FIGURE IN SHIRT AND TROUSERS PRESENTED
HIMSELF
MR JOSIAH BROWN I SUPPOSE SAID HOLMES
YES SIR AND YOU NO DOUBT ARE MR SHERLOCK HOLMES I HAD THE NOTE
WHICH YOU SENT BY THE EXPRESS MESSENGER AND I DID EXACTLY WHAT YOU
TOLD ME WE LOCKED EVERY DOOR ON THE INSIDE AND AWAITED DEVELOPMENTS
WELL IM VERY GLAD TO SEE THAT YOU HAVE GOT THE RASCAL I HOPE
GENTLEMEN THAT YOU WILL COME IN AND HAVE SOME REFRESHMENT
HOWEVER LESTRADE WAS ANXIOUS TO GET HIS MAN INTO SAFE QUARTERS SO
WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OUR CAB HAD BEEN SUMMONED AND WE WERE ALL FOUR
UPON OUR WAY TO LONDON NOT A WORD WOULD OUR CAPTIVE SAY BUT HE
GLARED AT US FROM THE SHADOW OF HIS MATTED HAIR AND ONCE WHEN MY
HAND SEEMED WITHIN HIS REACH HE SNAPPED AT IT LIKE A HUNGRY WOLF WE
STAYED LONG ENOUGH AT THE POLICESTATION TO LEARN THAT A SEARCH OF
HIS CLOTHING REVEALED NOTHING SAVE A FEW SHILLINGS AND A LONG SHEATH
KNIFE THE HANDLE OF WHICH BORE COPIOUS TRACES OF RECENT BLOOD
THATS ALL RIGHT SAID LESTRADE AS WE PARTED HILL KNOWS ALL
THESE GENTRY AND HE WILL GIVE A NAME TO HIM YOULL FIND THAT MY
THEORY OF THE MAFIA WILL WORK OUT ALL RIGHT BUT IM SURE I AM
EXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED TO YOU MR HOLMES FOR THE WORKMANLIKE WAY IN
WHICH YOU LAID HANDS UPON HIM I DONT QUITE UNDERSTAND IT ALL YET
I FEAR IT IS RATHER TOO LATE AN HOUR FOR EXPLANATIONS SAID HOLMES
BESIDES THERE ARE ONE OR TWO DETAILS WHICH ARE NOT FINISHED OFF
AND IT IS ONE OF THOSE CASES WHICH ARE WORTH WORKING OUT TO THE VERY
END IF YOU WILL COME ROUND ONCE MORE TO MY ROOMS AT SIX OCLOCK
TOMORROW I THINK I SHALL BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU THAT EVEN NOW YOU HAVE
NOT GRASPED THE ENTIRE MEANING OF THIS BUSINESS WHICH PRESENTS SOME
FEATURES WHICH MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY ORIGINAL IN THE HISTORY OF CRIME
IF EVER I PERMIT YOU TO CHRONICLE ANY MORE OF MY LITTLE PROBLEMS
WATSON I FORESEE THAT YOU WILL ENLIVEN YOUR PAGES BY AN ACCOUNT OF
THE SINGULAR ADVENTURE OF THE NAPOLEONIC BUSTS
WHEN WE MET AGAIN NEXT EVENING LESTRADE WAS FURNISHED WITH MUCH
INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR PRISONER HIS NAME IT APPEARED WAS
BEPPO SECOND NAME UNKNOWN HE WAS A WELLKNOWN NEERDOWELL AMONG
THE ITALIAN COLONY HE HAD ONCE BEEN A SKILFUL SCULPTOR AND HAD
EARNED AN HONEST LIVING BUT HE HAD TAKEN TO EVIL COURSES AND HAD
TWICE ALREADY BEEN IN JAILONCE FOR A PETTY THEFT AND ONCE AS WE
HAD ALREADY HEARD FOR STABBING A FELLOWCOUNTRYMAN HE COULD TALK
ENGLISH PERFECTLY WELL HIS REASONS FOR DESTROYING THE BUSTS WERE
STILL UNKNOWN AND HE REFUSED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS UPON THE
SUBJECT BUT THE POLICE HAD DISCOVERED THAT THESE SAME BUSTS MIGHT
VERY WELL HAVE BEEN MADE BY HIS OWN HANDS SINCE HE WAS ENGAGED IN
THIS CLASS OF WORK AT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GELDER CO TO ALL THIS
INFORMATION MUCH OF WHICH WE ALREADY KNEW HOLMES LISTENED WITH
POLITE ATTENTION BUT I WHO KNEW HIM SO WELL COULD CLEARLY SEE THAT
HIS THOUGHTS WERE ELSEWHERE AND I DETECTED A MIXTURE OF MINGLED
UNEASINESS AND EXPECTATION BENEATH THAT MASK WHICH HE WAS WONT TO
ASSUME AT LAST HE STARTED IN HIS CHAIR AND HIS EYES BRIGHTENED
THERE HAD BEEN A RING AT THE BELL A MINUTE LATER WE HEARD STEPS UPON
THE STAIRS AND AN ELDERLY REDFACED MAN WITH GRIZZLED SIDEWHISKERS
WAS USHERED IN IN HIS RIGHT HAND HE CARRIED AN OLDFASHIONED
CARPETBAG WHICH HE PLACED UPON THE TABLE
IS MR SHERLOCK HOLMES HERE
MY FRIEND BOWED AND SMILED MR SANDEFORD OF READING I SUPPOSE
SAID HE
YES SIR I FEAR THAT I AM A LITTLE LATE BUT THE TRAINS WERE
AWKWARD YOU WROTE TO ME ABOUT A BUST THAT IS IN MY POSSESSION
EXACTLY
I HAVE YOUR LETTER HERE YOU SAID I DESIRE TO POSSESS A COPY OF
DEVINES NAPOLEON AND AM PREPARED TO PAY YOU TEN POUNDS FOR THE ONE
WHICH IS IN YOUR POSSESSION IS THAT RIGHT
CERTAINLY
I WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED AT YOUR LETTER FOR I COULD NOT IMAGINE
HOW YOU KNEW THAT I OWNED SUCH A THING
OF COURSE YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BUT THE EXPLANATION IS VERY
SIMPLE MR HARDING OF HARDING BROTHERS SAID THAT THEY HAD SOLD YOU
THEIR LAST COPY AND HE GAVE ME YOUR ADDRESS
OH THAT WAS IT WAS IT DID HE TELL YOU WHAT I PAID FOR IT
NO HE DID NOT
WELL I AM AN HONEST MAN THOUGH NOT A VERY RICH ONE I ONLY GAVE
FIFTEEN SHILLINGS FOR THE BUST AND I THINK YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT
BEFORE I TAKE TEN POUNDS FROM YOU
I AM SURE THE SCRUPLE DOES YOU HONOUR MR SANDEFORD BUT I HAVE
NAMED THAT PRICE SO I INTEND TO STICK TO IT
WELL IT IS VERY HANDSOME OF YOU MR HOLMES I BROUGHT THE BUST UP
WITH ME AS YOU ASKED ME TO DO HERE IT IS HE OPENED HIS BAG AND
AT LAST WE SAW PLACED UPON OUR TABLE A COMPLETE SPECIMEN OF THAT BUST
WHICH WE HAD ALREADY SEEN MORE THAN ONCE IN FRAGMENTS
HOLMES TOOK A PAPER FROM HIS POCKET AND LAID A TENPOUND NOTE UPON
THE TABLE
YOU WILL KINDLY SIGN THAT PAPER MR SANDEFORD IN THE PRESENCE OF
THESE WITNESSES IT IS SIMPLY TO SAY THAT YOU TRANSFER EVERY POSSIBLE
RIGHT THAT YOU EVER HAD IN THE BUST TO ME I AM A METHODICAL MAN YOU
SEE AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT TURN EVENTS MIGHT TAKE AFTERWARDS THANK
YOU MR SANDEFORD HERE IS YOUR MONEY AND I WISH YOU A VERY GOOD
EVENING
WHEN OUR VISITOR HAD DISAPPEARED SHERLOCK HOLMESS MOVEMENTS WERE
SUCH AS TO RIVET OUR ATTENTION HE BEGAN BY TAKING A CLEAN WHITE
CLOTH FROM A DRAWER AND LAYING IT OVER THE TABLE THEN HE PLACED HIS
NEWLYACQUIRED BUST IN THE CENTRE OF THE CLOTH FINALLY HE PICKED UP
HIS HUNTINGCROP AND STRUCK NAPOLEON A SHARP BLOW ON THE TOP OF THE
HEAD THE FIGURE BROKE INTO FRAGMENTS AND HOLMES BENT EAGERLY OVER
THE SHATTERED REMAINS NEXT INSTANT WITH A LOUD SHOUT OF TRIUMPH HE
HELD UP ONE SPLINTER IN WHICH A ROUND DARK OBJECT WAS FIXED LIKE A
PLUM IN A PUDDING
GENTLEMEN HE CRIED LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO THE FAMOUS BLACK
PEARL OF THE BORGIAS
LESTRADE AND I SAT SILENT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WITH A SPONTANEOUS
IMPULSE WE BOTH BROKE OUT CLAPPING AS AT THE WELLWROUGHT CRISIS OF
A PLAY A FLUSH OF COLOUR SPRANG TO HOLMESS PALE CHEEKS AND HE
BOWED TO US LIKE THE MASTER DRAMATIST WHO RECEIVES THE HOMAGE OF HIS
AUDIENCE IT WAS AT SUCH MOMENTS THAT FOR AN INSTANT HE CEASED TO BE
A REASONING MACHINE AND BETRAYED HIS HUMAN LOVE FOR ADMIRATION AND
APPLAUSE THE SAME SINGULARLY PROUD AND RESERVED NATURE WHICH TURNED
AWAY WITH DISDAIN FROM POPULAR NOTORIETY WAS CAPABLE OF BEING MOVED
TO ITS DEPTHS BY SPONTANEOUS WONDER AND PRAISE FROM A FRIEND
YES GENTLEMEN SAID HE IT IS THE MOST FAMOUS PEARL NOW EXISTING
IN THE WORLD AND IT HAS BEEN MY GOOD FORTUNE BY A CONNECTED CHAIN
OF INDUCTIVE REASONING TO TRACE IT FROM THE PRINCE OF COLONNAS
BEDROOM AT THE DACRE HOTEL WHERE IT WAS LOST TO THE INTERIOR OF
THIS THE LAST OF THE SIX BUSTS OF NAPOLEON WHICH WERE MANUFACTURED
BY GELDER CO OF STEPNEY YOU WILL REMEMBER LESTRADE THE
SENSATION CAUSED BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS VALUABLE JEWEL AND THE
VAIN EFFORTS OF THE LONDON POLICE TO RECOVER IT I WAS MYSELF
CONSULTED UPON THE CASE BUT I WAS UNABLE TO THROW ANY LIGHT UPON IT
SUSPICION FELL UPON THE MAID OF THE PRINCESS WHO WAS AN ITALIAN AND
IT WAS PROVED THAT SHE HAD A BROTHER IN LONDON BUT WE FAILED TO
TRACE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM THE MAIDS NAME WAS LUCRETIA
VENUCCI AND THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THIS PIETRO WHO WAS
MURDERED TWO NIGHTS AGO WAS THE BROTHER I HAVE BEEN LOOKING UP THE
DATES IN THE OLD FILES OF THE PAPER AND I FIND THAT THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF THE PEARL WAS EXACTLY TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ARREST OF
BEPPO FOR SOME CRIME OF VIOLENCE AN EVENT WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THE
FACTORY OF GELDER CO AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THESE BUSTS WERE
BEING MADE NOW YOU CLEARLY SEE THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THOUGH YOU
SEE THEM OF COURSE IN THE INVERSE ORDER TO THE WAY IN WHICH THEY
PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO ME BEPPO HAD THE PEARL IN HIS POSSESSION HE
MAY HAVE STOLEN IT FROM PIETRO HE MAY HAVE BEEN PIETROS
CONFEDERATE HE MAY HAVE BEEN THE GOBETWEEN OF PIETRO AND HIS
SISTER IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO US WHICH IS THE CORRECT SOLUTION
THE MAIN FACT IS THAT HE HAD THE PEARL AND AT THAT MOMENT WHEN IT
WAS ON HIS PERSON HE WAS PURSUED BY THE POLICE HE MADE FOR THE
FACTORY IN WHICH HE WORKED AND HE KNEW THAT HE HAD ONLY A FEW
MINUTES IN WHICH TO CONCEAL THIS ENORMOUSLY VALUABLE PRIZE WHICH
WOULD OTHERWISE BE FOUND ON HIM WHEN HE WAS SEARCHED SIX PLASTER
CASTS OF NAPOLEON WERE DRYING IN THE PASSAGE ONE OF THEM WAS STILL
SOFT IN AN INSTANT BEPPO A SKILFUL WORKMAN MADE A SMALL HOLE IN
THE WET PLASTER DROPPED IN THE PEARL AND WITH A FEW TOUCHES COVERED
OVER THE APERTURE ONCE MORE IT WAS AN ADMIRABLE HIDINGPLACE NO ONE
COULD POSSIBLY FIND IT BUT BEPPO WAS CONDEMNED TO A YEARS
IMPRISONMENT AND IN THE MEANWHILE HIS SIX BUSTS WERE SCATTERED OVER
LONDON HE COULD NOT TELL WHICH CONTAINED HIS TREASURE ONLY BY
BREAKING THEM COULD HE SEE EVEN SHAKING WOULD TELL HIM NOTHING FOR
AS THE PLASTER WAS WET IT WAS PROBABLE THAT THE PEARL WOULD ADHERE TO
ITAS IN FACT IT HAS DONE BEPPO DID NOT DESPAIR AND HE CONDUCTED
HIS SEARCH WITH CONSIDERABLE INGENUITY AND PERSEVERANCE THROUGH A
COUSIN WHO WORKS WITH GELDER HE FOUND OUT THE RETAIL FIRMS WHO HAD
BOUGHT THE BUSTS HE MANAGED TO FIND EMPLOYMENT WITH MORSE HUDSON
AND IN THAT WAY TRACKED DOWN THREE OF THEM THE PEARL WAS NOT THERE
THEN WITH THE HELP OF SOME ITALIAN EMPLOYE HE SUCCEEDED IN FINDING
OUT WHERE THE OTHER THREE BUSTS HAD GONE THE FIRST WAS AT HARKERS
THERE HE WAS DOGGED BY HIS CONFEDERATE WHO HELD BEPPO RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE LOSS OF THE PEARL AND HE STABBED HIM IN THE SCUFFLE WHICH
FOLLOWED
IF HE WAS HIS CONFEDERATE WHY SHOULD HE CARRY HIS PHOTOGRAPH I
ASKED
AS A MEANS OF TRACING HIM IF HE WISHED TO INQUIRE ABOUT HIM FROM ANY
THIRD PERSON THAT WAS THE OBVIOUS REASON WELL AFTER THE MURDER I
CALCULATED THAT BEPPO WOULD PROBABLY HURRY RATHER THAN DELAY HIS
MOVEMENTS HE WOULD FEAR THAT THE POLICE WOULD READ HIS SECRET AND
SO HE HASTENED ON BEFORE THEY SHOULD GET AHEAD OF HIM OF COURSE I
COULD NOT SAY THAT HE HAD NOT FOUND THE PEARL IN HARKERS BUST I HAD
NOT EVEN CONCLUDED FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS THE PEARL BUT IT WAS
EVIDENT TO ME THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SINCE HE CARRIED THE
BUST PAST THE OTHER HOUSES IN ORDER TO BREAK IT IN THE GARDEN WHICH
HAD A LAMP OVERLOOKING IT SINCE HARKERS BUST WAS ONE IN THREE THE
CHANCES WERE EXACTLY AS I TOLD YOU TWO TO ONE AGAINST THE PEARL
BEING INSIDE IT THERE REMAINED TWO BUSTS AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE
WOULD GO FOR THE LONDON ONE FIRST I WARNED THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE
SO AS TO AVOID A SECOND TRAGEDY AND WE WENT DOWN WITH THE HAPPIEST
RESULTS BY THAT TIME OF COURSE I KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS THE
BORGIA PEARL THAT WE WERE AFTER THE NAME OF THE MURDERED MAN LINKED
THE ONE EVENT WITH THE OTHER THERE ONLY REMAINED A SINGLE BUSTTHE
READING ONEAND THE PEARL MUST BE THERE I BOUGHT IT IN YOUR
PRESENCE FROM THE OWNERAND THERE IT LIES
WE SAT IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT
WELL SAID LESTRADE IVE SEEN YOU HANDLE A GOOD MANY CASES MR
HOLMES BUT I DONT KNOW THAT I EVER KNEW A MORE WORKMANLIKE ONE THAN
THAT WERE NOT JEALOUS OF YOU AT SCOTLAND YARD NO SIR WE ARE VERY
PROUD OF YOU AND IF YOU COME DOWN TOMORROW THERES NOT A MAN FROM
THE OLDEST INSPECTOR TO THE YOUNGEST CONSTABLE WHO WOULDNT BE GLAD
TO SHAKE YOU BY THE HAND
THANK YOU SAID HOLMES THANK YOU AND AS HE TURNED AWAY IT
SEEMED TO ME THAT HE WAS MORE NEARLY MOVED BY THE SOFTER HUMAN
EMOTIONS THAN I HAD EVER SEEN HIM A MOMENT LATER HE WAS THE COLD AND
PRACTICAL THINKER ONCE MORE PUT THE PEARL IN THE SAFE WATSON
SAID HE AND GET OUT THE PAPERS OF THE CONKSINGLETON FORGERY CASE
GOODBYE LESTRADE IF ANY LITTLE PROBLEM COMES YOUR WAY I SHALL BE
HAPPY IF I CAN TO GIVE YOU A HINT OR TWO AS TO ITS SOLUTION
THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE STUDENTS
IT WAS IN THE YEAR THAT A COMBINATION OF EVENTS INTO WHICH I
NEED NOT ENTER CAUSED MR SHERLOCK HOLMES AND MYSELF TO SPEND SOME
WEEKS IN ONE OF OUR GREAT UNIVERSITY TOWNS AND IT WAS DURING THIS
TIME THAT THE SMALL BUT INSTRUCTIVE ADVENTURE WHICH I AM ABOUT TO
RELATE BEFELL US IT WILL BE OBVIOUS THAT ANY DETAILS WHICH WOULD
HELP THE READER TO EXACTLY IDENTIFY THE COLLEGE OR THE CRIMINAL WOULD
BE INJUDICIOUS AND OFFENSIVE SO PAINFUL A SCANDAL MAY WELL BE
ALLOWED TO DIE OUT WITH DUE DISCRETION THE INCIDENT ITSELF MAY
HOWEVER BE DESCRIBED SINCE IT SERVES TO ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THOSE
QUALITIES FOR WHICH MY FRIEND WAS REMARKABLE I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY
STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO
ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
WE WERE RESIDING AT THE TIME IN FURNISHED LODGINGS CLOSE TO A LIBRARY
WHERE SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS PURSUING SOME LABORIOUS RESEARCHES IN EARLY
ENGLISH CHARTERSRESEARCHES WHICH LED TO RESULTS SO STRIKING THAT
THEY MAY BE THE SUBJECT OF ONE OF MY FUTURE NARRATIVES HERE IT WAS
THAT ONE EVENING WE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM AN ACQUAINTANCE MR HILTON
SOAMES TUTOR AND LECTURER AT THE COLLEGE OF ST LUKES MR SOAMES
WAS A TALL SPARE MAN OF A NERVOUS AND EXCITABLE TEMPERAMENT I HAD
ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR
OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT
WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
I TRUST MR HOLMES THAT YOU CAN SPARE ME A FEW HOURS OF YOUR
VALUABLE TIME WE HAVE HAD A VERY PAINFUL INCIDENT AT ST LUKES AND
REALLY BUT FOR THE HAPPY CHANCE OF YOUR BEING IN THE TOWN I SHOULD
HAVE BEEN AT A LOSS WHAT TO DO
I AM VERY BUSY JUST NOW AND I DESIRE NO DISTRACTIONS MY FRIEND
ANSWERED I SHOULD MUCH PREFER THAT YOU CALLED IN THE AID OF THE
POLICE
NO NO MY DEAR SIR SUCH A COURSE IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN ONCE
THE LAW IS EVOKED IT CANNOT BE STAYED AGAIN AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF
THOSE CASES WHERE FOR THE CREDIT OF THE COLLEGE IT IS MOST
ESSENTIAL TO AVOID SCANDAL YOUR DISCRETION IS AS WELL KNOWN AS YOUR
POWERS AND YOU ARE THE ONE MAN IN THE WORLD WHO CAN HELP ME I BEG
YOU MR HOLMES TO DO WHAT YOU CAN
MY FRIENDS TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE
CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET WITHOUT HIS SCRAPBOOKS HIS
CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN HE
SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN UNGRACIOUS ACQUIESCENCE WHILE OUR VISITOR
IN HURRIED WORDS AND WITH MUCH EXCITABLE GESTICULATION POURED FORTH
HIS STORY
I MUST EXPLAIN TO YOU MR HOLMES THAT TOMORROW IS THE FIRST DAY
OF THE EXAMINATION FOR THE FORTESCUE SCHOLARSHIP I AM ONE OF THE
EXAMINERS MY SUBJECT IS GREEK AND THE FIRST OF THE PAPERS CONSISTS
OF A LARGE PASSAGE OF GREEK TRANSLATION WHICH THE CANDIDATE HAS NOT
SEEN THIS PASSAGE IS PRINTED ON THE EXAMINATION PAPER AND IT WOULD
NATURALLY BE AN IMMENSE ADVANTAGE IF THE CANDIDATE COULD PREPARE IT
IN ADVANCE FOR THIS REASON GREAT CARE IS TAKEN TO KEEP THE PAPER
SECRET
TODAY ABOUT THREE OCLOCK THE PROOFS OF THIS PAPER ARRIVED FROM THE
PRINTERS THE EXERCISE CONSISTS OF HALF A CHAPTER OF THUCYDIDES I
HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY
CORRECT AT FOURTHIRTY MY TASK WAS NOT YET COMPLETED I HAD
HOWEVER PROMISED TO TAKE TEA IN A FRIENDS ROOMS SO I LEFT THE
PROOF UPON MY DESK I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
YOU ARE AWARE MR HOLMES THAT OUR COLLEGE DOORS ARE DOUBLEA
GREEN BAIZE ONE WITHIN AND A HEAVY OAK ONE WITHOUT AS I APPROACHED
MY OUTER DOOR I WAS AMAZED TO SEE A KEY IN IT FOR AN INSTANT I
IMAGINED THAT I HAD LEFT MY OWN THERE BUT ON FEELING IN MY POCKET I
FOUND THAT IT WAS ALL RIGHT THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR
AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANNISTER A MAN
WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS
ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION I FOUND THAT THE KEY WAS INDEED HIS THAT
HE HAD ENTERED MY ROOM TO KNOW IF I WANTED TEA AND THAT HE HAD VERY
CARELESSLY LEFT THE KEY IN THE DOOR WHEN HE CAME OUT HIS VISIT TO MY
ROOM MUST HAVE BEEN WITHIN A VERY FEW MINUTES OF MY LEAVING IT HIS
FORGETFULNESS ABOUT THE KEY WOULD HAVE MATTERED LITTLE UPON ANY OTHER
OCCASION BUT ON THIS ONE DAY IT HAS PRODUCED THE MOST DEPLORABLE
CONSEQUENCES
THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD
RUMMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD
LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER NOW I FOUND THAT ONE OF THEM WAS LYING ON
THE FLOOR ONE WAS ON THE SIDE TABLE NEAR THE WINDOW AND THE THIRD
WAS WHERE I HAD LEFT IT
HOLMES STIRRED FOR THE FIRST TIME
THE FIRST PAGE ON THE FLOOR THE SECOND IN THE WINDOW THE THIRD
WHERE YOU LEFT IT SAID HE
EXACTLY MR HOLMES YOU AMAZE ME HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW
THAT
PRAY CONTINUE YOUR VERY INTERESTING STATEMENT
FOR AN INSTANT I IMAGINED THAT BANNISTER HAD TAKEN THE UNPARDONABLE
LIBERTY OF EXAMINING MY PAPERS HE DENIED IT HOWEVER WITH THE
UTMOST EARNESTNESS AND I AM CONVINCED THAT HE WAS SPEAKING THE
TRUTH THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOMEONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY
IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE
PAPERS A LARGE SUM OF MONEY IS AT STAKE FOR THE SCHOLARSHIP IS A
VERY VALUABLE ONE AND AN UNSCRUPULOUS MAN MIGHT VERY WELL RUN A RISK
IN ORDER TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE OVER HIS FELLOWS
BANNISTER WAS VERY MUCH UPSET BY THE INCIDENT HE HAD NEARLY FAINTED
WHEN WE FOUND THAT THE PAPERS HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN TAMPERED WITH I
GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I
MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM I SOON SAW THAT THE
INTRUDER HAD LEFT OTHER TRACES OF HIS PRESENCE BESIDES THE RUMPLED
PAPERS ON THE TABLE IN THE WINDOW WERE SEVERAL SHREDS FROM A PENCIL
WHICH HAD BEEN SHARPENED A BROKEN TIP OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
EVIDENTLY THE RASCAL HAD COPIED THE PAPER IN A GREAT HURRY HAD
BROKEN HIS PENCIL AND HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO PUT A FRESH POINT TO
IT
EXCELLENT SAID HOLMES WHO WAS RECOVERING HIS GOODHUMOUR AS HIS
ATTENTION BECAME MORE ENGROSSED BY THE CASE FORTUNE HAS BEEN YOUR
FRIEND
THIS WAS NOT ALL I HAVE A NEW WRITINGTABLE WITH A FINE SURFACE OF
RED LEATHER I AM PREPARED TO SWEAR AND SO IS BANNISTER THAT IT WAS
SMOOTH AND UNSTAINED NOW I FOUND A CLEAN CUT IN IT ABOUT THREE
INCHES LONGNOT A MERE SCRATCH BUT A POSITIVE CUT NOT ONLY THIS
BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOUGH OR CLAY WITH
SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAWDUST IN IT I AM CONVINCED
THAT THESE MARKS WERE LEFT BY THE MAN WHO RIFLED THE PAPERS THERE
WERE NO FOOTMARKS AND NO OTHER EVIDENCE AS TO HIS IDENTITY I WAS AT
MY WITS ENDS WHEN SUDDENLY THE HAPPY THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME THAT
YOU WERE IN THE TOWN AND I CAME STRAIGHT ROUND TO PUT THE MATTER
INTO YOUR HANDS DO HELP ME MR HOLMES YOU SEE MY DILEMMA EITHER I
MUST FIND THE MAN OR ELSE THE EXAMINATION MUST BE POSTPONED UNTIL
FRESH PAPERS ARE PREPARED AND SINCE THIS CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT
EXPLANATION THERE WILL ENSUE A HIDEOUS SCANDAL WHICH WILL THROW A
CLOUD NOT ONLY ON THE COLLEGE BUT ON THE UNIVERSITY ABOVE ALL
THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
I SHALL BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO IT AND TO GIVE YOU SUCH ADVICE AS I
CAN SAID HOLMES RISING AND PUTTING ON HIS OVERCOAT THE CASE IS
NOT ENTIRELY DEVOID OF INTEREST HAD ANYONE VISITED YOU IN YOUR ROOM
AFTER THE PAPERS CAME TO YOU
YES YOUNG DAULAT RAS AN INDIAN STUDENT WHO LIVES ON THE SAME
STAIR CAME IN TO ASK ME SOME PARTICULARS ABOUT THE EXAMINATION
FOR WHICH HE WAS ENTERED
YES
AND THE PAPERS WERE ON YOUR TABLE
TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
BUT MIGHT BE RECOGNISED AS PROOFS
POSSIBLY
NO ONE ELSE IN YOUR ROOM
NO
DID ANYONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE
NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
DID THIS MAN BANNISTER KNOW
NO CERTAINLY NOT NO ONE KNEW
WHERE IS BANNISTER NOW
HE WAS VERY ILL POOR FELLOW I LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN THE CHAIR I
WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU
YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
I LOCKED UP THE PAPERS FIRST
THEN IT AMOUNTS TO THIS MR SOAMES THAT UNLESS THE INDIAN STUDENT
RECOGNISED THE ROLL AS BEING PROOFS THE MAN WHO TAMPERED WITH THEM
CAME UPON THEM ACCIDENTALLY WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THEY WERE THERE
SO IT SEEMS TO ME
HOLMES GAVE AN ENIGMATIC SMILE
WELL SAID HE LET US GO ROUND NOT ONE OF YOUR CASES
WATSONMENTAL NOT PHYSICAL ALL RIGHT COME IF YOU WANT TO NOW
MR SOAMESAT YOUR DISPOSAL
THE SITTINGROOM OF OUR CLIENT OPENED BY A LONG LOW LATTICED
WINDOW ON TO THE ANCIENT LICHENTINTED COURT OF THE OLD COLLEGE A
GOTHIC ARCHED DOOR LED TO A WORN STONE STAIRCASE ON THE GROUND FLOOR
WAS THE TUTORS ROOM ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
IT WAS ALREADY TWILIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE SCENE OF OUR PROBLEM
HOLMES HALTED AND LOOKED EARNESTLY AT THE WINDOW THEN HE APPROACHED
IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRANED HE LOOKED INTO THE
ROOM
HE MUST HAVE ENTERED THROUGH THE DOOR THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT
THE ONE PANE SAID OUR LEARNED GUIDE
DEAR ME SAID HOLMES AND HE SMILED IN A SINGULAR WAY AS HE GLANCED
AT OUR COMPANION WELL IF THERE IS NOTHING TO BE LEARNED HERE WE
HAD BEST GO INSIDE
THE LECTURER UNLOCKED THE OUTER DOOR AND USHERED US INTO HIS ROOM WE
STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE WHILE HOLMES MADE AN EXAMINATION OF THE CARPET
I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE ONE COULD HARDLY
HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY YOUR SERVANT SEEMS TO HAVE QUITE
RECOVERED YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR
BY THE WINDOW THERE
I SEE NEAR THIS LITTLE TABLE YOU CAN COME IN NOW I HAVE FINISHED
WITH THE CARPET LET US TAKE THE LITTLE TABLE FIRST OF COURSE WHAT
HAS HAPPENED IS VERY CLEAR THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS
SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE HE CARRIED THEM OVER TO THE
WINDOW TABLE BECAUSE FROM THERE HE COULD SEE IF YOU CAME ACROSS THE
COURTYARD AND SO COULD EFFECT AN ESCAPE
AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOAMES FOR I ENTERED BY
THE SIDE DOOR
AH THATS GOOD WELL ANYHOW THAT WAS IN HIS MIND LET ME SEE THE
THREE STRIPS NO FINGER IMPRESSIONSNO WELL HE CARRIED OVER THIS
ONE FIRST AND HE COPIED IT HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT
USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF
THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREATVERY
HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL
YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE YOU WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY HURRYING FEET
ON THE STAIR AS YOU ENTERED THE OUTER DOOR
NO I CANT SAY I WAS
WELL HE WROTE SO FURIOUSLY THAT HE BROKE HIS PENCIL AND HAD AS
YOU OBSERVE TO SHARPEN IT AGAIN THIS IS OF INTEREST WATSON THE
PENCIL WAS NOT AN ORDINARY ONE IT WAS ABOVE THE USUAL SIZE WITH A
SOFT LEAD THE OUTER COLOUR WAS DARK BLUE THE MAKERS NAME WAS
PRINTED IN SILVER LETTERING AND THE PIECE REMAINING IS ONLY ABOUT AN
INCH AND A HALF LONG LOOK FOR SUCH A PENCIL MR SOAMES AND YOU
HAVE GOT YOUR MAN WHEN I ADD THAT HE POSSESSES A LARGE AND VERY
BLUNT KNIFE YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL AID
MR SOAMES WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION I
CAN FOLLOW THE OTHER POINTS SAID HE BUT REALLY IN THIS MATTER OF
THE LENGTH
HOLMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS NN AND A SPACE OF CLEAR
WOOD AFTER THEM
YOU SEE
NO I FEAR THAT EVEN NOW
WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS WHAT
COULD THIS NN BE IT IS AT THE END OF A WORD YOU ARE AWARE THAT
JOHANN FABER IS THE MOST COMMON MAKERS NAME IS IT NOT CLEAR THAT
THERE IS JUST AS MUCH OF THE PENCIL LEFT AS USUALLY FOLLOWS THE
JOHANN HE HELD THE SMALL TABLE SIDEWAYS TO THE ELECTRIC LIGHT I
WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF
IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
I DONT THINK THERE IS ANYTHING MORE TO BE LEARNED HERE NOW FOR THE
CENTRAL TABLE THIS SMALL PELLET IS I PRESUME THE BLACK DOUGHY
MASS YOU SPOKE OF ROUGHLY PYRAMIDAL IN SHAPE AND HOLLOWED OUT I
PERCEIVE AS YOU SAY THERE APPEAR TO BE GRAINS OF SAWDUST IN IT
DEAR ME THIS IS VERY INTERESTING AND THE CUTA POSITIVE TEAR I
SEE IT BEGAN WITH A THIN SCRATCH AND ENDED IN A JAGGED HOLE I AM
MUCH INDEBTED TO YOU FOR DIRECTING MY ATTENTION TO THIS CASE MR
SOAMES WHERE DOES THAT DOOR LEAD TO
TO MY BEDROOM
HAVE YOU BEEN IN IT SINCE YOUR ADVENTURE
NO I CAME STRAIGHT AWAY FOR YOU
I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A GLANCE ROUND WHAT A CHARMING OLDFASHIONED
ROOM PERHAPS YOU WILL KINDLY WAIT A MINUTE UNTIL I HAVE EXAMINED THE
FLOOR NO I SEE NOTHING WHAT ABOUT THIS CURTAIN YOU HANG YOUR
CLOTHES BEHIND IT IF ANYONE WERE FORCED TO CONCEAL HIMSELF IN THIS
ROOM HE MUST DO IT THERE SINCE THE BED IS TOO LOW AND THE WARDROBE
TOO SHALLOW NO ONE THERE I SUPPOSE
AS HOLMES DREW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND
ALERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY AS
A MATTER OF FACT THE DRAWN CURTAIN DISCLOSED NOTHING BUT THREE OR
FOUR SUITS OF CLOTHES HANGING FROM A LINE OF PEGS HOLMES TURNED AWAY
AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR
HALLOA WHATS THIS SAID HE
IT WAS A SMALL PYRAMID OF BLACK PUTTYLIKE STUFF EXACTLY LIKE THE
ONE UPON THE TABLE OF THE STUDY HOLMES HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM
IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
YOUR VISITOR SEEMS TO HAVE LEFT TRACES IN YOUR BEDROOM AS WELL AS IN
YOUR SITTINGROOM MR SOAMES
WHAT COULD HE HAVE WANTED THERE
I THINK IT IS CLEAR ENOUGH YOU CAME BACK BY AN UNEXPECTED WAY AND
SO HE HAD NO WARNING UNTIL YOU WERE AT THE VERY DOOR WHAT COULD HE
DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO
YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
GOOD GRACIOUS MR HOLMES DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT ALL THE TIME
I WAS TALKING TO BANNISTER IN THIS ROOM WE HAD THE MAN PRISONER IF WE
HAD ONLY KNOWN IT
SO I READ IT
SURELY THERE IS ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE MR HOLMES I DONT KNOW
WHETHER YOU OBSERVED MY BEDROOM WINDOW
LATTICEPANED LEAD FRAMEWORK THREE SEPARATE WINDOWS ONE SWINGING
ON HINGE AND LARGE ENOUGH TO ADMIT A MAN
EXACTLY AND IT LOOKS OUT ON AN ANGLE OF THE COURTYARD SO AS TO BE
PARTLY INVISIBLE THE MAN MIGHT HAVE EFFECTED HIS ENTRANCE THERE
LEFT TRACES AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE BEDROOM AND FINALLY FINDING
THE DOOR OPEN HAVE ESCAPED THAT WAY
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD IMPATIENTLY
LET US BE PRACTICAL SAID HE I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE
ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING
YOUR DOOR
YES THERE ARE
AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAMINATION
YES
HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO SUSPECT ANY ONE OF THEM MORE THAN THE
OTHERS
SOAMES HESITATED
IT IS A VERY DELICATE QUESTION SAID HE ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW
SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
LET US HEAR THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
I WILL TELL YOU THEN IN A FEW WORDS THE CHARACTER OF THE THREE MEN
WHO INHABIT THESE ROOMS THE LOWER OF THE THREE IS GILCHRIST A FINE
SCHOLAR AND ATHLETE PLAYS IN THE RUGBY TEAM AND THE CRICKET TEAM FOR
THE COLLEGE AND GOT HIS BLUE FOR THE HURDLES AND THE LONG JUMP HE
IS A FINE MANLY FELLOW HIS FATHER WAS THE NOTORIOUS SIR JABEZ
GILCHRIST WHO RUINED HIMSELF ON THE TURF MY SCHOLAR HAS BEEN LEFT
VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARDWORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
THE SECOND FLOOR IS INHABITED BY DAULAT RAS THE INDIAN HE IS A
QUIET INSCRUTABLE FELLOW AS MOST OF THOSE INDIANS ARE HE IS WELL
UP IN HIS WORK THOUGH HIS GREEK IS HIS WEAK SUBJECT HE IS STEADY
AND METHODICAL
THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MILES MCLAREN HE IS A BRILLIANT FELLOW
WHEN HE CHOOSES TO WORKONE OF THE BRIGHTEST INTELLECTS OF THE
UNIVERSITY BUT HE IS WAYWARD DISSIPATED AND UNPRINCIPLED HE WAS
NEARLY EXPELLED OVER A CARD SCANDAL IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE HAS BEEN
IDLING ALL THIS TERM AND HE MUST LOOK FORWARD WITH DREAD TO THE
EXAMINATION
THEN IT IS HE WHOM YOU SUSPECT
I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE
LEAST UNLIKELY
EXACTLY NOW MR SOAMES LET US HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR SERVANT
BANNISTER
HE WAS A LITTLE WHITEFACED CLEANSHAVEN GRIZZLYHAIRED FELLOW OF
FIFTY HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THIS SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE
QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE HIS PLUMP FACE WAS TWITCHING WITH HIS
NERVOUSNESS AND HIS FINGERS COULD NOT KEEP STILL
WE ARE INVESTIGATING THIS UNHAPPY BUSINESS BANNISTER SAID HIS
MASTER
YES SIR
I UNDERSTAND SAID HOLMES THAT YOU LEFT YOUR KEY IN THE DOOR
YES SIR
WAS IT NOT VERY EXTRAORDINARY THAT YOU SHOULD DO THIS ON THE VERY
DAY WHEN THERE WERE THESE PAPERS INSIDE
IT WAS MOST UNFORTUNATE SIR BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME
THING AT OTHER TIMES

KEY THEN I FORGOT

LOOKING VERY BADQUITE GHASTLY
YOU STAYED HERE WHEN YOUR MASTER LEFT
ONLY FOR A MINUTE OR SO THEN I LOCKED THE DOOR AND WENT TO MY
ROOM

GENTLEMAN IN THIS UNIVERSITY WHO IS CAPABLE OF PROFITING BY SUCH AN
ACTION NO SIR ILL NOT BELIEVE IT
THANK YOU THAT WILL DO SAID HOLMES OH ONE MORE WORD YOU HAVE
NOT MENTIONED TO ANY OF THE THREE GENTLEMEN WHOM YOU ATTEND THAT
ANYTHING IS AMISS
NO SIR NOT A WORD
YOU HAVENT SEEN ANY OF THEM
NO SIR
VERY GOOD NOW MR SOAMES WE WILL TAKE A WALK IN THE QUADRANGLE
IF YOU PLEASE
THREE YELLOW SQUARES OF LIGHT SHONE ABOVE US IN THE GATHERING GLOOM
YOUR THREE BIRDS ARE ALL IN THEIR NESTS SAID HOLMES LOOKING UP
HALLOA WHATS THAT ONE OF THEM SEEMS RESTLESS ENOUGH
IT WAS THE INDIAN WHOSE DARK SILHOUETTE APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS
BLIND HE WAS PACING SWIFTLY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM
I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A PEEP AT EACH OF THEM SAID HOLMES IS IT
POSSIBLE
NO DIFFICULTY IN THE WORLD SOAMES ANSWERED THIS SET OF ROOMS IS
QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS
TO GO OVER THEM COME ALONG AND I WILL PERSONALLY CONDUCT YOU
NO NAMES PLEASE SAID HOLMES AS WE KNOCKED AT GILCHRISTS DOOR A
TALL FLAXENHAIRED SLIM YOUNG FELLOW OPENED IT AND MADE US WELCOME
WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD OUR ERRAND THERE WERE SOME REALLY CURIOUS PIECES
OF MEDIAEVAL DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE WITHIN HOLMES WAS SO CHARMED WITH
ONE OF THEM THAT HE INSISTED ON DRAWING IT ON HIS NOTEBOOK BROKE
HIS PENCIL HAD TO BORROW ONE FROM OUR HOST AND FINALLY BORROWED A
KNIFE TO SHARPEN HIS OWN THE SAME CURIOUS ACCIDENT HAPPENED TO HIM
IN THE ROOMS OF THE INDIANA SILENT LITTLE HOOKNOSED FELLOW WHO
EYED US ASKANCE AND WAS OBVIOUSLY GLAD WHEN HOLMESS ARCHITECTURAL
STUDIES HAD COME TO AN END I COULD NOT SEE THAT IN EITHER CASE
HOLMES HAD COME UPON THE CLUE FOR WHICH HE WAS SEARCHING ONLY AT THE
THIRD DID OUR VISIT PROVE ABORTIVE THE OUTER DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN TO
OUR KNOCK AND NOTHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAN A TORRENT OF BAD
LANGUAGE CAME FROM BEHIND IT I DONT CARE WHO YOU ARE YOU CAN GO
TO BLAZES ROARED THE ANGRY VOICE TOMORROWS THE EXAM AND I
WONT BE DRAWN BY ANYONE
A RUDE FELLOW SAID OUR GUIDE FLUSHING WITH ANGER AS WE WITHDREW
DOWN THE STAIR OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS
KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND
INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS
HOLMESS RESPONSE WAS A CURIOUS ONE
CAN YOU TELL ME HIS EXACT HEIGHT HE ASKED
REALLY MR HOLMES I CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO SAY HE IS TALLER THAN THE
INDIAN NOT SO TALL AS GILCHRIST I SUPPOSE FIVE FOOT SIX WOULD BE
ABOUT IT
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID HOLMES AND NOW MR SOAMES I WISH
YOU GOODNIGHT
OUR GUIDE CRIED ALOUD IN HIS ASTONISHMENT AND DISMAY GOOD GRACIOUS
MR HOLMES YOU ARE SURELY NOT GOING TO LEAVE ME IN THIS ABRUPT
FASHION YOU DONT SEEM TO REALIZE THE POSITION TOMORROW IS THE
EXAMINATION I MUST TAKE SOME DEFINITE ACTION TONIGHT I CANNOT
ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN
TAMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED
YOU MUST LEAVE IT AS IT IS I SHALL DROP ROUND EARLY TOMORROW
MORNING AND CHAT THE MATTER OVER IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A
POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION MEANWHILE YOU CHANGE
NOTHINGNOTHING AT ALL
VERY GOOD MR HOLMES
YOU CAN BE PERFECTLY EASY IN YOUR MIND WE SHALL CERTAINLY FIND SOME
WAY OUT OF YOUR DIFFICULTIES I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME
ALSO THE PENCIL CUTTINGS GOODBYE
WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP
AT THE WINDOWS THE INDIAN STILL PACED HIS ROOM THE OTHERS WERE
INVISIBLE
WELL WATSON WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT HOLMES ASKED AS WE CAME OUT
INTO THE MAIN STREET QUITE A LITTLE PARLOUR GAMESORT OF
THREECARD TRICK IS IT NOT THERE ARE YOUR THREE MEN IT MUST BE ONE
OF THEM YOU TAKE YOUR CHOICE WHICH IS YOURS
THE FOULMOUTHED FELLOW AT THE TOP HE IS THE ONE WITH THE WORST
RECORD AND YET THAT INDIAN WAS A SLY FELLOW ALSO WHY SHOULD HE BE
PACING HIS ROOM ALL THE TIME
THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT MANY MEN DO IT WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO
LEARN ANYTHING BY HEART
HE LOOKED AT US IN A QUEER WAY
SO WOULD YOU IF A FLOCK OF STRANGERS CAME IN ON YOU WHEN YOU WERE
PREPARING FOR AN EXAMINATION NEXT DAY AND EVERY MOMENT WAS OF VALUE
NO I SEE NOTHING IN THAT PENCILS TOO AND KNIVESALL WAS
SATISFACTORY BUT THAT FELLOW DOES PUZZLE ME
WHO
WHY BANNISTER THE SERVANT WHATS HIS GAME IN THE MATTER
HE IMPRESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECTLY HONEST MAN
SO HE DID ME THATS THE PUZZLING PART WHY SHOULD A PERFECTLY
HONEST MANWELL WELL HERES A LARGE STATIONERS WE SHALL BEGIN
OUR RESEARCHES HERE
THERE WERE ONLY FOUR STATIONERS OF ANY CONSEQUENCE IN THE TOWN AND
AT EACH HOLMES PRODUCED HIS PENCIL CHIPS AND BID HIGH FOR A
DUPLICATE ALL WERE AGREED THAT ONE COULD BE ORDERED BUT THAT IT WAS
NOT A USUAL SIZE OF PENCIL AND THAT IT WAS SELDOM KEPT IN STOCK MY
FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILURE BUT SHRUGGED
HIS SHOULDERS IN HALFHUMOROUS RESIGNATION
NO GOOD MY DEAR WATSON THIS THE BEST AND ONLY FINAL CLUE HAS RUN
TO NOTHING BUT INDEED I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT WE CAN BUILD UP A
SUFFICIENT CASE WITHOUT IT BY JOVE MY DEAR FELLOW IT IS NEARLY
NINE AND THE LANDLADY BABBLED OF GREEN PEAS AT SEVENTHIRTY WHAT
WITH YOUR ETERNAL TOBACCO WATSON AND YOUR IRREGULARITY AT MEALS I
EXPECT THAT YOU WILL GET NOTICE TO QUIT AND THAT I SHALL SHARE YOUR
DOWNFALLNOT HOWEVER BEFORE WE HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF THE
NERVOUS TUTOR THE CARELESS SERVANT AND THE THREE ENTERPRISING
STUDENTS
HOLMES MADE NO FURTHER ALLUSION TO THE MATTER THAT DAY THOUGH HE
SAT LOST IN THOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME AFTER OUR BELATED DINNER AT
EIGHT IN THE MORNING HE CAME INTO MY ROOM JUST AS I FINISHED MY
TOILET
WELL WATSON SAID HE IT IS TIME WE WENT DOWN TO ST LUKES CAN
YOU DO WITHOUT BREAKFAST
CERTAINLY
SOAMES WILL BE IN A DREADFUL FIDGET UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO TELL HIM
SOMETHING POSITIVE
HAVE YOU ANYTHING POSITIVE TO TELL HIM
I THINK SO
YOU HAVE FORMED A CONCLUSION
YES MY DEAR WATSON I HAVE SOLVED THE MYSTERY
BUT WHAT FRESH EVIDENCE COULD YOU HAVE GOT
AHA IT IS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT I HAVE TURNED MYSELF OUT OF BED AT
THE UNTIMELY HOUR OF SIX I HAVE PUT IN TWO HOURS HARD WORK AND
COVERED AT LEAST FIVE MILES WITH SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR IT LOOK AT
THAT
HE HELD OUT HIS HAND ON THE PALM WERE THREE LITTLE PYRAMIDS OF
BLACK DOUGHY CLAY
WHY HOLMES YOU HAD ONLY TWO YESTERDAY
AND ONE MORE THIS MORNING IT IS A FAIR ARGUMENT THAT WHEREVER NO CAME
FROM IS ALSO THE SOURCE OF NOS AND EH WATSON WELL COME
ALONG AND PUT FRIEND SOAMES OUT OF HIS PAIN
THE UNFORTUNATE TUTOR WAS CERTAINLY IN A STATE OF PITIABLE AGITATION
WHEN WE FOUND HIM IN HIS CHAMBERS IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION
WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE
FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE
SCHOLARSHIP HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL
AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOLMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS
OUTSTRETCHED
THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME I FEARED THAT YOU HAD GIVEN IT UP
IN DESPAIR WHAT AM I TO DO SHALL THE EXAMINATION PROCEED
YES LET IT PROCEED BY ALL MEANS
BUT THIS RASCAL
HE SHALL NOT COMPETE
YOU KNOW HIM
I THINK SO IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE
OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE
COURTMARTIAL YOU THERE IF YOU PLEASE SOAMES WATSON YOU HERE
ILL TAKE THE ARMCHAIR IN THE MIDDLE I THINK THAT WE ARE NOW
SUFFICIENTLY IMPOSING TO STRIKE TERROR INTO A GUILTY BREAST KINDLY
RING THE BELL
BANNISTER ENTERED AND SHRUNK BACK IN EVIDENT SURPRISE AND FEAR AT
OUR JUDICIAL APPEARANCE
YOU WILL KINDLY CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HOLMES NOW BANNISTER WILL
YOU PLEASE TELL US THE TRUTH ABOUT YESTERDAYS INCIDENT
THE MAN TURNED WHITE TO THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR
I HAVE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING SIR
NOTHING TO ADD
NOTHING AT ALL SIR
WELL THEN I MUST MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS TO YOU WHEN YOU SAT DOWN
ON THAT CHAIR YESTERDAY DID YOU DO SO IN ORDER TO CONCEAL SOME
OBJECT WHICH WOULD HAVE SHOWN WHO HAD BEEN IN THE ROOM
BANNISTERS FACE WAS GHASTLY
NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT
IT IS ONLY A SUGGESTION SAID HOLMES SUAVELY I FRANKLY ADMIT
THAT I AM UNABLE TO PROVE IT BUT IT SEEMS PROBABLE ENOUGH SINCE THE
MOMENT THAT MR SOAMESS BACK WAS TURNED YOU RELEASED THE MAN WHO WAS
HIDING IN THAT BEDROOM
BANNISTER LICKED HIS DRY LIPS
THERE WAS NO MAN SIR
AH THATS A PITY BANNISTER UP TO NOW YOU MAY HAVE SPOKEN THE
TRUTH BUT NOW I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE LIED
THE MANS FACE SET IN SULLEN DEFIANCE
THERE WAS NO MAN SIR
COME COME BANNISTER
NO SIR THERE WAS NO ONE
IN THAT CASE YOU CAN GIVE US NO FURTHER INFORMATION WOULD YOU
PLEASE REMAIN IN THE ROOM STAND OVER THERE NEAR THE BEDROOM DOOR
NOW SOAMES I AM GOING TO ASK YOU TO HAVE THE GREAT KINDNESS TO GO
UP TO THE ROOM OF YOUNG GILCHRIST AND TO ASK HIM TO STEP DOWN INTO
YOURS
AN INSTANT LATER THE TUTOR RETURNED BRINGING WITH HIM THE STUDENT
HE WAS A FINE FIGURE OF A MAN TALL LITHE AND AGILE WITH A SPRINGY
STEP AND A PLEASANT OPEN FACE HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT
EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY
UPON BANNISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER
JUST CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HOLMES NOW MR GILCHRIST WE ARE ALL
QUITE ALONE HERE AND NO ONE NEED EVER KNOW ONE WORD OF WHAT PASSES
BETWEEN US WE CAN BE PERFECTLY FRANK WITH EACH OTHER WE WANT TO
KNOW MR GILCHRIST HOW YOU AN HONOURABLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMMIT
SUCH AN ACTION AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
THE UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN STAGGERED BACK AND CAST A LOOK FULL OF
HORROR AND REPROACH AT BANNISTER
NO NO MR GILCHRIST SIR I NEVER SAID A WORDNEVER ONE WORD
CRIED THE SERVANT
NO BUT YOU HAVE NOW SAID HOLMES NOW SIR YOU MUST SEE THAT
AFTER BANNISTERS WORDS YOUR POSITION IS HOPELESS AND THAT YOUR ONLY
CHANCE LIES IN A FRANK CONFESSION
FOR A MOMENT GILCHRIST WITH UPRAISED HAND TRIED TO CONTROL HIS
WRITHING FEATURES THE NEXT HE HAD THROWN HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BESIDE
THE TABLE AND BURYING HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS HE HAD BURST INTO A
STORM OF PASSIONATE SOBBING
COME COME SAID HOLMES KINDLY IT IS HUMAN TO ERR AND AT LEAST
NO ONE CAN ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A CALLOUS CRIMINAL PERHAPS IT WOULD
BE EASIER FOR YOU IF I WERE TO TELL MR SOAMES WHAT OCCURRED AND YOU
CAN CHECK ME WHERE I AM WRONG SHALL I DO SO WELL WELL DONT
TROUBLE TO ANSWER LISTEN AND SEE THAT I DO YOU NO INJUSTICE
FROM THE MOMENT MR SOAMES THAT YOU SAID TO ME THAT NO ONE NOT
EVEN BANNISTER COULD HAVE TOLD THAT THE PAPERS WERE IN YOUR ROOM
THE CASE BEGAN TO TAKE A DEFINITE SHAPE IN MY MIND THE PRINTER ONE
COULD OF COURSE DISMISS HE COULD EXAMINE THE PAPERS IN HIS OWN
OFFICE THE INDIAN I ALSO THOUGHT NOTHING OF IF THE PROOFS WERE IN A
ROLL HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY KNOW WHAT THEY WERE ON THE OTHER HAND IT
SEEMED AN UNTHINKABLE COINCIDENCE THAT A MAN SHOULD DARE TO ENTER THE
ROOM AND THAT BY CHANCE ON THAT VERY DAY THE PAPERS WERE ON THE
TABLE I DISMISSED THAT THE MAN WHO ENTERED KNEW THAT THE PAPERS
WERE THERE HOW DID HE KNOW
WHEN I APPROACHED YOUR ROOM I EXAMINED THE WINDOW YOU AMUSED ME BY
SUPPOSING THAT I WAS CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF SOMEONE HAVING
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT UNDER THE EYES OF ALL THESE OPPOSITE ROOMS FORCED
HIMSELF THROUGH IT SUCH AN IDEA WAS ABSURD I WAS MEASURING HOW TALL
A MAN WOULD NEED TO BE IN ORDER TO SEE AS HE PASSED WHAT PAPERS WERE
ON THE CENTRAL TABLE I AM SIX FEET HIGH AND I COULD DO IT WITH AN
EFFORT NO ONE LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE ALREADY YOU SEE I
HAD REASON TO THINK THAT IF ONE OF YOUR THREE STUDENTS WAS A MAN OF
UNUSUAL HEIGHT HE WAS THE MOST WORTH WATCHING OF THE THREE
I ENTERED AND I TOOK YOU INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF
THE SIDE TABLE OF THE CENTRE TABLE I COULD MAKE NOTHING UNTIL IN
YOUR DESCRIPTION OF GILCHRIST YOU MENTIONED THAT HE WAS A
LONGDISTANCE JUMPER THEN THE WHOLE THING CAME TO ME IN AN INSTANT
AND I ONLY NEEDED CERTAIN CORROBORATIVE PROOFS WHICH I SPEEDILY
OBTAINED
WHAT HAPPENED WAS THIS THIS YOUNG FELLOW HAD EMPLOYED HIS AFTERNOON
AT THE ATHLETIC GROUNDS WHERE HE HAD BEEN PRACTISING THE JUMP HE
RETURNED CARRYING HIS JUMPING SHOES WHICH ARE PROVIDED AS YOU ARE
AWARE WITH SEVERAL SHARP SPIKES AS HE PASSED YOUR WINDOW HE SAW BY
MEANS OF HIS GREAT HEIGHT THESE PROOFS UPON YOUR TABLE AND
CONJECTURED WHAT THEY WERE NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT
BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KEY WHICH HAD BEEN
LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER
HIM TO ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED THE PROOFS IT WAS NOT A
DANGEROUS EXPLOIT FOR HE COULD ALWAYS PRETEND THAT HE HAD SIMPLY
LOOKED IN TO ASK A QUESTION
WELL WHEN HE SAW THAT THEY WERE INDEED THE PROOFS IT WAS THEN THAT
HE YIELDED TO TEMPTATION HE PUT HIS SHOES ON THE TABLE WHAT WAS IT
YOU PUT ON THAT CHAIR NEAR THE WINDOW
GLOVES SAID THE YOUNG MAN
HOLMES LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT BANNISTER HE PUT HIS GLOVES ON THE
CHAIR AND HE TOOK THE PROOFS SHEET BY SHEET TO COPY THEM HE
THOUGHT THE TUTOR MUST RETURN BY THE MAIN GATE AND THAT HE WOULD SEE
HIM AS WE KNOW HE CAME BACK BY THE SIDE GATE SUDDENLY HE HEARD HIM
AT THE VERY DOOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE ESCAPE HE FORGOT HIS GLOVES
BUT HE CAUGHT UP HIS SHOES AND DARTED INTO THE BEDROOM YOU OBSERVE
THAT THE SCRATCH ON THAT TABLE IS SLIGHT AT ONE SIDE BUT DEEPENS IN
THE DIRECTION OF THE BEDROOM DOOR THAT IN ITSELF IS ENOUGH TO SHOW
US THAT THE SHOE HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THAT DIRECTION AND THAT THE
CULPRIT HAD TAKEN REFUGE THERE THE EARTH ROUND THE SPIKE HAD BEEN
LEFT ON THE TABLE AND A SECOND SAMPLE WAS LOOSENED AND FELL IN THE
BEDROOM I MAY ADD THAT I WALKED OUT TO THE ATHLETIC GROUNDS THIS
MORNING SAW THAT TENACIOUS BLACK CLAY IS USED IN THE JUMPINGPIT
AND CARRIED AWAY A SPECIMEN OF IT TOGETHER WITH SOME OF THE FINE TAN
OR SAWDUST WHICH IS STREWN OVER IT TO PREVENT THE ATHLETE FROM
SLIPPING HAVE I TOLD THE TRUTH MR GILCHRIST
THE STUDENT HAD DRAWN HIMSELF ERECT
YES SIR IT IS TRUE SAID HE
GOOD HEAVENS HAVE YOU NOTHING TO ADD CRIED SOAMES
YES SIR I HAVE BUT THE SHOCK OF THIS DISGRACEFUL EXPOSURE HAS
BEWILDERED ME I HAVE A LETTER HERE MR SOAMES WHICH I WROTE TO YOU
EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESTLESS NIGHT IT WAS BEFORE I
KNEW THAT MY SIN HAD FOUND ME OUT HERE IT IS SIR YOU WILL SEE THAT
I HAVE SAID I HAVE DETERMINED NOT TO GO IN FOR THE EXAMINATION I
HAVE BEEN OFFERED A COMMISSION IN THE RHODESIAN POLICE AND I AM
GOING OUT TO SOUTH AFRICA AT ONCE
I AM INDEED PLEASED TO HEAR THAT YOU DID NOT INTEND TO PROFIT BY
YOUR UNFAIR ADVANTAGE SAID SOAMES BUT WHY DID YOU CHANGE YOUR
PURPOSE
GILCHRIST POINTED TO BANNISTER
THERE IS THE MAN WHO SET ME IN THE RIGHT PATH SAID HE
COME NOW BANNISTER SAID HOLMES IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM
WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT
SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN
YOU WENT OUT AS TO HIS ESCAPING BY THAT WINDOW IT WAS INCREDIBLE
CAN YOU NOT CLEAR UP THE LAST POINT IN THIS MYSTERY AND TELL US THE
REASONS FOR YOUR ACTION
IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR
CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW TIME WAS SIR WHEN
I WAS BUTLER TO OLD SIR JABEZ GILCHRIST THIS YOUNG GENTLEMANS
FATHER WHEN HE WAS RUINED I CAME TO THE COLLEGE AS SERVANT BUT I
NEVER FORGOT MY OLD EMPLOYER BECAUSE HE WAS DOWN IN THE WORLD I
WATCHED HIS SON ALL I COULD FOR THE SAKE OF THE OLD DAYS WELL SIR
WHEN I CAME INTO THIS ROOM YESTERDAY WHEN THE ALARM WAS GIVEN THE
VERY FIRST THING I SAW WAS MR GILCHRISTS TAN GLOVES ALYING IN THAT
CHAIR I KNEW THOSE GLOVES WELL AND I UNDERSTOOD THEIR MESSAGE IF
MR SOAMES SAW THEM THE GAME WAS UP I FLOPPED DOWN INTO THAT CHAIR
AND NOTHING WOULD BUDGE ME UNTIL MR SOAMES HE WENT FOR YOU THEN OUT
CAME MY POOR YOUNG MASTER WHOM I HAD DANDLED ON MY KNEE AND
CONFESSED IT ALL TO ME WASNT IT NATURAL SIR THAT I SHOULD SAVE
HIM AND WASNT IT NATURAL ALSO THAT I SHOULD TRY TO SPEAK TO HIM AS
HIS DEAD FATHER WOULD HAVE DONE AND MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT HE
COULD NOT PROFIT BY SUCH A DEED COULD YOU BLAME ME SIR
NO INDEED SAID HOLMES HEARTILY SPRINGING TO HIS FEET WELL
SOAMES I THINK WE HAVE CLEARED YOUR LITTLE PROBLEM UP AND OUR
BREAKFAST AWAITS US AT HOME COME WATSON AS TO YOU SIR I TRUST
THAT A BRIGHT FUTURE AWAITS YOU IN RHODESIA FOR ONCE YOU HAVE FALLEN
LOW LET US SEE IN THE FUTURE HOW HIGH YOU CAN RISE
THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCENEZ
WHEN I LOOK AT THE THREE MASSIVE MANUSCRIPT VOLUMES WHICH CONTAIN OUR
WORK FOR THE YEAR I CONFESS THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME
OUT OF SUCH A WEALTH OF MATERIAL TO SELECT THE CASES WHICH ARE MOST
INTERESTING IN THEMSELVES AND AT THE SAME TIME MOST CONDUCIVE TO A
DISPLAY OF THOSE PECULIAR POWERS FOR WHICH MY FRIEND WAS FAMOUS AS I
TURN OVER THE PAGES I SEE MY NOTES UPON THE REPULSIVE STORY OF THE
RED LEECH AND THE TERRIBLE DEATH OF CROSBY THE BANKER HERE ALSO I
FIND AN ACCOUNT OF THE ADDLETON TRAGEDY AND THE SINGULAR CONTENTS OF
THE ANCIENT BRITISH BARROW THE FAMOUS SMITHMORTIMER SUCCESSION CASE
COMES ALSO WITHIN THIS PERIOD AND SO DOES THE TRACKING AND ARREST OF
HURET THE BOULEVARD ASSASSINAN EXPLOIT WHICH WON FOR HOLMES AN
AUTOGRAPH LETTER OF THANKS FROM THE FRENCH PRESIDENT AND THE ORDER OF
THE LEGION OF HONOUR EACH OF THESE WOULD FURNISH A NARRATIVE BUT ON
THE WHOLE I AM OF OPINION THAT NONE OF THEM UNITE SO MANY SINGULAR
POINTS OF INTEREST AS THE EPISODE OF YOXLEY OLD PLACE WHICH INCLUDES
NOT ONLY THE LAMENTABLE DEATH OF YOUNG WILLOUGHBY SMITH BUT ALSO
THOSE SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS WHICH THREW SO CURIOUS A LIGHT UPON THE
CAUSES OF THE CRIME
IT WAS A WILD TEMPESTUOUS NIGHT TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF NOVEMBER
HOLMES AND I SAT TOGETHER IN SILENCE ALL THE EVENING HE ENGAGED WITH
A POWERFUL LENS DECIPHERING THE REMAINS OF THE ORIGINAL INSCRIPTION
UPON A PALIMPSEST I DEEP IN A RECENT TREATISE UPON SURGERY OUTSIDE
THE WIND HOWLED DOWN BAKER STREET WHILE THE RAIN BEAT FIERCELY
AGAINST THE WINDOWS IT WAS STRANGE THERE IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF THE
TOWN WITH TEN MILES OF MANS HANDIWORK ON EVERY SIDE OF US TO FEEL
THE IRON GRIP OF NATURE AND TO BE CONSCIOUS THAT TO THE HUGE
ELEMENTAL FORCES ALL LONDON WAS NO MORE THAN THE MOLEHILLS THAT DOT
THE FIELDS I WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT ON THE DESERTED
STREET THE OCCASIONAL LAMPS GLEAMED ON THE EXPANSE OF MUDDY ROAD AND
SHINING PAVEMENT A SINGLE CAB WAS SPLASHING ITS WAY FROM THE OXFORD
STREET END
WELL WATSON ITS AS WELL WE HAVE NOT TO TURN OUT TONIGHT SAID
HOLMES LAYING ASIDE HIS LENS AND ROLLING UP THE PALIMPSEST IVE
DONE ENOUGH FOR ONE SITTING IT IS TRYING WORK FOR THE EYES SO FAR
AS I CAN MAKE OUT IT IS NOTHING MORE EXCITING THAN AN ABBEYS
ACCOUNTS DATING FROM THE SECOND HALF OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
HALLOA HALLOA HALLOA WHATS THIS
AMID THE DRONING OF THE WIND THERE HAD COME THE STAMPING OF A HORSES
HOOFS AND THE LONG GRIND OF A WHEEL AS IT RASPED AGAINST THE KERB
THE CAB WHICH I HAD SEEN HAD PULLED UP AT OUR DOOR
WHAT CAN HE WANT I EJACULATED AS A MAN STEPPED OUT OF IT
WANT HE WANTS US AND WE MY POOR WATSON WANT OVERCOATS AND
CRAVATS AND GALOSHES AND EVERY AID THAT MAN EVER INVENTED TO FIGHT
THE WEATHER WAIT A BIT THOUGH THERES THE CAB OFF AGAIN THERES
HOPE YET HED HAVE KEPT IT IF HE HAD WANTED US TO COME RUN DOWN MY
DEAR FELLOW AND OPEN THE DOOR FOR ALL VIRTUOUS FOLK HAVE BEEN LONG
IN BED
WHEN THE LIGHT OF THE HALL LAMP FELL UPON OUR MIDNIGHT VISITOR I HAD
NO DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNISING HIM IT WAS YOUNG STANLEY HOPKINS A
PROMISING DETECTIVE IN WHOSE CAREER HOLMES HAD SEVERAL TIMES SHOWN A
VERY PRACTICAL INTEREST
IS HE IN HE ASKED EAGERLY
COME UP MY DEAR SIR SAID HOLMESS VOICE FROM ABOVE I HOPE YOU
HAVE NO DESIGNS UPON US ON SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
THE DETECTIVE MOUNTED THE STAIRS AND OUR LAMP GLEAMED UPON HIS
SHINING WATERPROOF I HELPED HIM OUT OF IT WHILE HOLMES KNOCKED A
BLAZE OUT OF THE LOGS IN THE GRATE
NOW MY DEAR HOPKINS DRAW UP AND WARM YOUR TOES SAID HE HERES
A CIGAR AND THE DOCTOR HAS A PRESCRIPTION CONTAINING HOT WATER AND A
LEMON WHICH IS GOOD MEDICINE ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS IT MUST BE
SOMETHING IMPORTANT WHICH HAS BROUGHT YOU OUT IN SUCH A GALE
IT IS INDEED MR HOLMES IVE HAD A BUSTLING AFTERNOON I PROMISE
YOU DID YOU SEE ANYTHING OF THE YOXLEY CASE IN THE LATEST EDITIONS
IVE SEEN NOTHING LATER THAN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY TODAY
WELL IT WAS ONLY A PARAGRAPH AND ALL WRONG AT THAT SO YOU HAVE
NOT MISSED ANYTHING I HAVENT LET THE GRASS GROW UNDER MY FEET ITS
DOWN IN KENT SEVEN MILES FROM CHATHAM AND THREE FROM THE RAILWAY
LINE I WAS WIRED FOR AT THREEFIFTEEN REACHED YOXLEY OLD PLACE AT
FIVE CONDUCTED MY INVESTIGATION WAS BACK AT CHARING CROSS BY THE
LAST TRAIN AND STRAIGHT TO YOU BY CAB
WHICH MEANS I SUPPOSE THAT YOU ARE NOT QUITE CLEAR ABOUT YOUR
CASE
IT MEANS THAT I CAN MAKE NEITHER HEAD NOR TAIL OF IT SO FAR AS I
CAN SEE IT IS JUST AS TANGLED A BUSINESS AS EVER I HANDLED AND YET
AT FIRST IT SEEMED SO SIMPLE THAT ONE COULDNT GO WRONG THERES NO
MOTIVE MR HOLMES THATS WHAT BOTHERS MEI CANT PUT MY HAND ON A
MOTIVE HERES A MAN DEADTHERES NO DENYING THATBUT SO FAR AS I
CAN SEE NO REASON ON EARTH WHY ANYONE SHOULD WISH HIM HARM
HOLMES LIT HIS CIGAR AND LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR
LET US HEAR ABOUT IT SAID HE
IVE GOT MY FACTS PRETTY CLEAR SAID STANLEY HOPKINS ALL I WANT
NOW IS TO KNOW WHAT THEY ALL MEAN THE STORY SO FAR AS I CAN MAKE IT
OUT IS LIKE THIS SOME YEARS AGO THIS COUNTRY HOUSE YOXLEY OLD
PLACE WAS TAKEN BY AN ELDERLY MAN WHO GAVE THE NAME OF PROFESSOR
CORAM HE WAS AN INVALID KEEPING HIS BED HALF THE TIME AND THE
OTHER HALF HOBBLING ROUND THE HOUSE WITH A STICK OR BEING PUSHED
ABOUT THE GROUNDS BY THE GARDENER IN A BATHCHAIR HE WAS WELL LIKED
BY THE FEW NEIGHBOURS WHO CALLED UPON HIM AND HE HAS THE REPUTATION
DOWN THERE OF BEING A VERY LEARNED MAN HIS HOUSEHOLD USED TO CONSIST
OF AN ELDERLY HOUSEKEEPER MRS MARKER AND OF A MAID SUSAN TARLTON
THESE HAVE BOTH BEEN WITH HIM SINCE HIS ARRIVAL AND THEY SEEM TO BE
WOMEN OF EXCELLENT CHARACTER THE PROFESSOR IS WRITING A LEARNED
BOOK AND HE FOUND IT NECESSARY ABOUT A YEAR AGO TO ENGAGE A
SECRETARY THE FIRST TWO THAT HE TRIED WERE NOT SUCCESSES BUT THE
THIRD MR WILLOUGHBY SMITH A VERY YOUNG MAN STRAIGHT FROM THE
UNIVERSITY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN JUST WHAT HIS EMPLOYER WANTED HIS
WORK CONSISTED IN WRITING ALL THE MORNING TO THE PROFESSORS
DICTATION AND HE USUALLY SPENT THE EVENING IN HUNTING UP REFERENCES
AND PASSAGES WHICH BORE UPON THE NEXT DAYS WORK THIS WILLOUGHBY
SMITH HAS NOTHING AGAINST HIM EITHER AS A BOY AT UPPINGHAM OR AS A
YOUNG MAN AT CAMBRIDGE I HAVE SEEN HIS TESTIMONIALS AND FROM THE
FIRST HE WAS A DECENT QUIET HARDWORKING FELLOW WITH NO WEAK SPOT
IN HIM AT ALL AND YET THIS IS THE LAD WHO HAS MET HIS DEATH THIS
MORNING IN THE PROFESSORS STUDY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH CAN POINT
ONLY TO MURDER
THE WIND HOWLED AND SCREAMED AT THE WINDOWS HOLMES AND I DREW CLOSER
TO THE FIRE WHILE THE YOUNG INSPECTOR SLOWLY AND POINT BY POINT
DEVELOPED HIS SINGULAR NARRATIVE
IF YOU WERE TO SEARCH ALL ENGLAND SAID HE I DONT SUPPOSE YOU
COULD FIND A HOUSEHOLD MORE SELFCONTAINED OR FREE FROM OUTSIDE
INFLUENCES WHOLE WEEKS WOULD PASS AND NOT ONE OF THEM GO PAST THE
GARDEN GATE THE PROFESSOR WAS BURIED IN HIS WORK AND EXISTED FOR
NOTHING ELSE YOUNG SMITH KNEW NOBODY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND LIVED
VERY MUCH AS HIS EMPLOYER DID THE TWO WOMEN HAD NOTHING TO TAKE THEM
FROM THE HOUSE MORTIMER THE GARDENER WHO WHEELS THE BATHCHAIR IS
AN ARMY PENSIONERAN OLD CRIMEAN MAN OF EXCELLENT CHARACTER HE DOES
NOT LIVE IN THE HOUSE BUT IN A THREEROOMED COTTAGE AT THE OTHER END
OF THE GARDEN THOSE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULD FIND WITHIN
THE GROUNDS OF YOXLEY OLD PLACE AT THE SAME TIME THE GATE OF THE
GARDEN IS A HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE MAIN LONDON TO CHATHAM ROAD IT
OPENS WITH A LATCH AND THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT ANYONE FROM
WALKING IN
NOW I WILL GIVE YOU THE EVIDENCE OF SUSAN TARLTON WHO IS THE ONLY
PERSON WHO CAN SAY ANYTHING POSITIVE ABOUT THE MATTER IT WAS IN THE
FORENOON BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE SHE WAS ENGAGED AT THE MOMENT IN
HANGING SOME CURTAINS IN THE UPSTAIRS FRONT BEDROOM PROFESSOR CORAM
WAS STILL IN BED FOR WHEN THE WEATHER IS BAD HE SELDOM RISES BEFORE
MIDDAY THE HOUSEKEEPER WAS BUSIED WITH SOME WORK IN THE BACK OF THE
HOUSE WILLOUGHBY SMITH HAD BEEN IN HIS BEDROOM WHICH HE USES AS A
SITTINGROOM BUT THE MAID HEARD HIM AT THAT MOMENT PASS ALONG THE
PASSAGE AND DESCEND TO THE STUDY IMMEDIATELY BELOW HER SHE DID NOT
SEE HIM BUT SHE SAYS THAT SHE COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN IN HIS QUICK
FIRM TREAD SHE DID NOT HEAR THE STUDY DOOR CLOSE BUT A MINUTE OR SO
LATER THERE WAS A DREADFUL CRY IN THE ROOM BELOW IT WAS A WILD
HOARSE SCREAM SO STRANGE AND UNNATURAL THAT IT MIGHT HAVE COME
EITHER FROM A MAN OR A WOMAN AT THE SAME INSTANT THERE WAS A HEAVY
THUD WHICH SHOOK THE OLD HOUSE AND THEN ALL WAS SILENCE THE MAID
STOOD PETRIFIED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN RECOVERING HER COURAGE SHE
RAN DOWNSTAIRS THE STUDY DOOR WAS SHUT AND SHE OPENED IT INSIDE
YOUNG MR WILLOUGHBY SMITH WAS STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR AT FIRST SHE
COULD SEE NO INJURY BUT AS SHE TRIED TO RAISE HIM SHE SAW THAT BLOOD
WAS POURING FROM THE UNDERSIDE OF HIS NECK IT WAS PIERCED BY A VERY
SMALL BUT VERY DEEP WOUND WHICH HAD DIVIDED THE CAROTID ARTERY THE
INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH THE INJURY HAD BEEN INFLICTED LAY UPON THE
CARPET BESIDE HIM IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SMALL SEALINGWAX KNIVES TO BE
FOUND ON OLDFASHIONED WRITINGTABLES WITH AN IVORY HANDLE AND A
STIFF BLADE IT WAS PART OF THE FITTINGS OF THE PROFESSORS OWN DESK
AT FIRST THE MAID THOUGHT THAT YOUNG SMITH WAS ALREADY DEAD BUT ON
POURING SOME WATER FROM THE CARAFE OVER HIS FOREHEAD HE OPENED HIS
EYES FOR AN INSTANT THE PROFESSOR HE MURMUREDIT WAS SHE THE
MAID IS PREPARED TO SWEAR THAT THOSE WERE THE EXACT WORDS HE TRIED
DESPERATELY TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE AND HE HELD HIS RIGHT HAND UP IN
THE AIR THEN HE FELL BACK DEAD
IN THE MEANTIME THE HOUSEKEEPER HAD ALSO ARRIVED UPON THE SCENE BUT
SHE WAS JUST TOO LATE TO CATCH THE YOUNG MANS DYING WORDS LEAVING
SUSAN WITH THE BODY SHE HURRIED TO THE PROFESSORS ROOM HE WAS
SITTING UP IN BED HORRIBLY AGITATED FOR HE HAD HEARD ENOUGH TO
CONVINCE HIM THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAD OCCURRED MRS MARKER IS
PREPARED TO SWEAR THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS STILL IN HIS NIGHTCLOTHES
AND INDEED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DRESS WITHOUT THE HELP OF
MORTIMER WHOSE ORDERS WERE TO COME AT TWELVE OCLOCK THE PROFESSOR
DECLARES THAT HE HEARD THE DISTANT CRY BUT THAT HE KNOWS NOTHING
MORE HE CAN GIVE NO EXPLANATION OF THE YOUNG MANS LAST WORDS THE
PROFESSORIT WAS SHE BUT IMAGINES THAT THEY WERE THE OUTCOME OF
DELIRIUM HE BELIEVES THAT WILLOUGHBY SMITH HAD NOT AN ENEMY IN THE
WORLD AND CAN GIVE NO REASON FOR THE CRIME HIS FIRST ACTION WAS TO
SEND MORTIMER THE GARDENER FOR THE LOCAL POLICE A LITTLE LATER THE
CHIEF CONSTABLE SENT FOR ME NOTHING WAS MOVED BEFORE I GOT THERE
AND STRICT ORDERS WERE GIVEN THAT NO ONE SHOULD WALK UPON THE PATHS
LEADING TO THE HOUSE IT WAS A SPLENDID CHANCE OF PUTTING YOUR
THEORIES INTO PRACTICE MR SHERLOCK HOLMES THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING
WANTING
EXCEPT MR SHERLOCK HOLMES SAID MY COMPANION WITH A SOMEWHAT
BITTER SMILE WELL LET US HEAR ABOUT IT WHAT SORT OF JOB DID YOU
MAKE OF IT
I MUST ASK YOU FIRST MR HOLMES TO GLANCE AT THIS ROUGH PLAN
WHICH WILL GIVE YOU A GENERAL IDEA OF THE POSITION OF THE PROFESSORS
STUDY AND THE VARIOUS POINTS OF THE CASE IT WILL HELP YOU IN
FOLLOWING MY INVESTIGATION
HE UNFOLDED THE ROUGH CHART WHICH I HERE REPRODUCE AND HE LAID IT
ACROSS HOLMESS KNEE I ROSE AND STANDING BEHIND HOLMES I STUDIED
IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
PICTURE SKETCH OF THE BUILDINGS ROOM AND CORRIDORS IT IS VERY ROUGH OF
COURSE AND IT ONLY DEALS WITH THE POINTS WHICH
SEEM TO ME TO BE ESSENTIAL ALL THE REST YOU WILL SEE LATER FOR
YOURSELF NOW FIRST OF ALL PRESUMING THAT THE ASSASSIN ENTERED THE
HOUSE HOW DID HE OR SHE COME IN UNDOUBTEDLY BY THE GARDEN PATH AND
THE BACK DOOR FROM WHICH THERE IS DIRECT ACCESS TO THE STUDY ANY
OTHER WAY WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY COMPLICATED THE ESCAPE MUST
HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE ALONG THAT LINE FOR OF THE TWO OTHER EXITS FROM
THE ROOM ONE WAS BLOCKED BY SUSAN AS SHE RAN DOWNSTAIRS AND THE OTHER
LEADS STRAIGHT TO THE PROFESSORS BEDROOM I THEREFORE DIRECTED MY
ATTENTION AT ONCE TO THE GARDEN PATH WHICH WAS SATURATED WITH RECENT
RAIN AND WOULD CERTAINLY SHOW ANY FOOTMARKS
MY EXAMINATION SHOWED ME THAT I WAS DEALING WITH A CAUTIOUS AND
EXPERT CRIMINAL NO FOOTMARKS WERE TO BE FOUND ON THE PATH THERE
COULD BE NO QUESTION HOWEVER THAT SOMEONE HAD PASSED ALONG THE
GRASS BORDER WHICH LINES THE PATH AND THAT HE HAD DONE SO IN ORDER
TO AVOID LEAVING A TRACK I COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF
A DISTINCT IMPRESSION BUT THE GRASS WAS TRODDEN DOWN AND SOMEONE HAD
UNDOUBTEDLY PASSED IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN THE MURDERER SINCE
NEITHER THE GARDENER NOR ANYONE ELSE HAD BEEN THERE THAT MORNING AND
THE RAIN HAD ONLY BEGUN DURING THE NIGHT
ONE MOMENT SAID HOLMES WHERE DOES THIS PATH LEAD TO
TO THE ROAD
HOW LONG IS IT
A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO
AT THE POINT WHERE THE PATH PASSES THROUGH THE GATE YOU COULD SURELY
PICK UP THE TRACKS
UNFORTUNATELY THE PATH WAS TILED AT THAT POINT
WELL ON THE ROAD ITSELF
NO IT WAS ALL TRODDEN INTO MIRE
TUTTUT WELL THEN THESE TRACKS UPON THE GRASS WERE THEY COMING
OR GOING
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY THERE WAS NEVER ANY OUTLINE
A LARGE FOOT OR A SMALL
YOU COULD NOT DISTINGUISH
HOLMES GAVE AN EJACULATION OF IMPATIENCE
IT HAS BEEN POURING RAIN AND BLOWING A HURRICANE EVER SINCE SAID
HE IT WILL BE HARDER TO READ NOW THAN THAT PALIMPSEST WELL WELL
IT CANT BE HELPED WHAT DID YOU DO HOPKINS AFTER YOU HAD MADE
CERTAIN THAT YOU HAD MADE CERTAIN OF NOTHING
I THINK I MADE CERTAIN OF A GOOD DEAL MR HOLMES I KNEW THAT
SOMEONE HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE CAUTIOUSLY FROM WITHOUT I NEXT
EXAMINED THE CORRIDOR IT IS LINED WITH COCOANUT MATTING AND HAD
TAKEN NO IMPRESSION OF ANY KIND THIS BROUGHT ME INTO THE STUDY
ITSELF IT IS A SCANTILYFURNISHED ROOM THE MAIN ARTICLE IS A LARGE
WRITINGTABLE WITH A FIXED BUREAU THIS BUREAU CONSISTS OF A DOUBLE
COLUMN OF DRAWERS WITH A CENTRAL SMALL CUPBOARD BETWEEN THEM THE
DRAWERS WERE OPEN THE CUPBOARD LOCKED THE DRAWERS IT SEEMS WERE
ALWAYS OPEN AND NOTHING OF VALUE WAS KEPT IN THEM THERE WERE SOME
PAPERS OF IMPORTANCE IN THE CUPBOARD BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS THAT
THIS HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH AND THE PROFESSOR ASSURES ME THAT
NOTHING WAS MISSING IT IS CERTAIN THAT NO ROBBERY HAS BEEN
COMMITTED
I COME NOW TO THE BODY OF THE YOUNG MAN IT WAS FOUND NEAR THE
BUREAU AND JUST TO THE LEFT OF IT AS MARKED UPON THAT CHART THE
STAB WAS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE NECK AND FROM BEHIND FORWARDS SO
THAT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN SELFINFLICTED
UNLESS HE FELL UPON THE KNIFE SAID HOLMES
EXACTLY THE IDEA CROSSED MY MIND BUT WE FOUND THE KNIFE SOME FEET
AWAY FROM THE BODY SO THAT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THEN OF COURSE THERE
ARE THE MANS OWN DYING WORDS AND FINALLY THERE WAS THIS VERY
IMPORTANT PIECE OF EVIDENCE WHICH WAS FOUND CLASPED IN THE DEAD MANS
RIGHT HAND
FROM HIS POCKET STANLEY HOPKINS DREW A SMALL PAPER PACKET HE
UNFOLDED IT AND DISCLOSED A GOLDEN PINCENEZ WITH TWO BROKEN ENDS OF
BLACK SILK CORD DANGLING FROM THE END OF IT WILLOUGHBY SMITH HAD
EXCELLENT SIGHT HE ADDED THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION THAT THIS WAS
SNATCHED FROM THE FACE OR THE PERSON OF THE ASSASSIN
SHERLOCK HOLMES TOOK THE GLASSES INTO HIS HAND AND EXAMINED THEM WITH
THE UTMOST ATTENTION AND INTEREST HE HELD THEM ON HIS NOSE
ENDEAVOURED TO READ THROUGH THEM WENT TO THE WINDOW AND STARED UP
THE STREET WITH THEM LOOKED AT THEM MOST MINUTELY IN THE FULL LIGHT
OF THE LAMP AND FINALLY WITH A CHUCKLE SEATED HIMSELF AT THE TABLE
AND WROTE A FEW LINES UPON A SHEET OF PAPER WHICH HE TOSSED ACROSS
TO STANLEY HOPKINS
THATS THE BEST I CAN DO FOR YOU SAID HE IT MAY PROVE TO BE OF
SOME USE
THE ASTONISHED DETECTIVE READ THE NOTE ALOUD IT RAN AS FOLLOWS
WANTED A WOMAN OF GOOD ADDRESS ATTIRED LIKE A LADY SHE HAS A
REMARKABLY THICK NOSE WITH EYES WHICH ARE SET CLOSE UPON EITHER SIDE
OF IT SHE HAS A PUCKERED FOREHEAD A PEERING EXPRESSION AND
PROBABLY ROUNDED SHOULDERS THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT SHE HAS HAD
RECOURSE TO AN OPTICIAN AT LEAST TWICE DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHS AS
HER GLASSES ARE OF REMARKABLE STRENGTH AND AS OPTICIANS ARE NOT VERY
NUMEROUS THERE SHOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN TRACING HER
HOLMES SMILED AT THE ASTONISHMENT OF HOPKINS WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN
REFLECTED UPON MY FEATURES
SURELY MY DEDUCTIONS ARE SIMPLICITY ITSELF SAID HE IT WOULD BE
DIFFICULT TO NAME ANY ARTICLES WHICH AFFORD A FINER FIELD FOR
INFERENCE THAN A PAIR OF GLASSES ESPECIALLY SO REMARKABLE A PAIR AS
THESE THAT THEY BELONG TO A WOMAN I INFER FROM THEIR DELICACY AND
ALSO OF COURSE FROM THE LAST WORDS OF THE DYING MAN AS TO HER
BEING A PERSON OF REFINEMENT AND WELL DRESSED THEY ARE AS YOU
PERCEIVE HANDSOMELY MOUNTED IN SOLID GOLD AND IT IS INCONCEIVABLE
THAT ANYONE WHO WORE SUCH GLASSES COULD BE SLATTERNLY IN OTHER
RESPECTS YOU WILL FIND THAT THE CLIPS ARE TOO WIDE FOR YOUR NOSE
SHOWING THAT THE LADYS NOSE WAS VERY BROAD AT THE BASE THIS SORT OF
NOSE IS USUALLY A SHORT AND COARSE ONE BUT THERE ARE A SUFFICIENT
NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS TO PREVENT ME FROM BEING DOGMATIC OR FROM
INSISTING UPON THIS POINT IN MY DESCRIPTION MY OWN FACE IS A NARROW
ONE AND YET I FIND THAT I CANNOT GET MY EYES INTO THE CENTRE OR
NEAR THE CENTRE OF THESE GLASSES THEREFORE THE LADYS EYES ARE SET
VERY NEAR TO THE SIDES OF THE NOSE YOU WILL PERCEIVE WATSON THAT
THE GLASSES ARE CONCAVE AND OF UNUSUAL STRENGTH A LADY WHOSE VISION
HAS BEEN SO EXTREMELY CONTRACTED ALL HER LIFE IS SURE TO HAVE THE
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SUCH VISION WHICH ARE SEEN IN THE
FOREHEAD THE EYELIDS AND THE SHOULDERS
YES I SAID I CAN FOLLOW EACH OF YOUR ARGUMENTS I CONFESS
HOWEVER THAT I AM UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU ARRIVE AT THE DOUBLE
VISIT TO THE OPTICIAN
HOLMES TOOK THE GLASSES IN HIS HAND
YOU WILL PERCEIVE HE SAID THAT THE CLIPS ARE LINED WITH TINY
BANDS OF CORK TO SOFTEN THE PRESSURE UPON THE NOSE ONE OF THESE IS
DISCOLOURED AND WORN TO SOME SLIGHT EXTENT BUT THE OTHER IS NEW
EVIDENTLY ONE HAS FALLEN OFF AND BEEN REPLACED I SHOULD JUDGE THAT
THE OLDER OF THEM HAS NOT BEEN THERE MORE THAN A FEW MONTHS THEY
EXACTLY CORRESPOND SO I GATHER THAT THE LADY WENT BACK TO THE SAME
ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE SECOND
BY GEORGE ITS MARVELLOUS CRIED HOPKINS IN AN ECSTASY OF
ADMIRATION TO THINK THAT I HAD ALL THAT EVIDENCE IN MY HAND AND
NEVER KNEW IT I HAD INTENDED HOWEVER TO GO THE ROUND OF THE LONDON
OPTICIANS
OF COURSE YOU WOULD MEANWHILE HAVE YOU ANYTHING MORE TO TELL US
ABOUT THE CASE
NOTHING MR HOLMES I THINK THAT YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS I DO
NOWPROBABLY MORE WE HAVE HAD INQUIRIES MADE AS TO ANY STRANGER
SEEN ON THE COUNTRY ROADS OR AT THE RAILWAY STATION WE HAVE HEARD OF
NONE WHAT BEATS ME IS THE UTTER WANT OF ALL OBJECT IN THE CRIME NOT
A GHOST OF A MOTIVE CAN ANYONE SUGGEST
AH THERE I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO HELP YOU BUT I SUPPOSE YOU WANT
US TO COME OUT TOMORROW
IF IT IS NOT ASKING TOO MUCH MR HOLMES THERES A TRAIN FROM
CHARING CROSS TO CHATHAM AT SIX IN THE MORNING AND WE SHOULD BE AT
YOXLEY OLD PLACE BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE
THEN WE SHALL TAKE IT YOUR CASE HAS CERTAINLY SOME FEATURES OF
GREAT INTEREST AND I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO LOOK INTO IT WELL ITS
NEARLY ONE AND WE HAD BEST GET A FEW HOURS SLEEP I DARE SAY YOU
CAN MANAGE ALL RIGHT ON THE SOFA IN FRONT OF THE FIRE ILL LIGHT MY
SPIRITLAMP AND GIVE YOU A CUP OF COFFEE BEFORE WE START
THE GALE HAD BLOWN ITSELF OUT NEXT DAY BUT IT WAS A BITTER MORNING
WHEN WE STARTED UPON OUR JOURNEY WE SAW THE COLD WINTER SUN RISE
OVER THE DREARY MARSHES OF THE THAMES AND THE LONG SULLEN REACHES OF
THE RIVER WHICH I SHALL EVER ASSOCIATE WITH OUR PURSUIT OF THE
ANDAMAN ISLANDER IN THE EARLIER DAYS OF OUR CAREER AFTER A LONG AND
WEARY JOURNEY WE ALIGHTED AT A SMALL STATION SOME MILES FROM CHATHAM
WHILE A HORSE WAS BEING PUT INTO A TRAP AT THE LOCAL INN WE SNATCHED
A HURRIED BREAKFAST AND SO WE WERE ALL READY FOR BUSINESS WHEN WE AT
LAST ARRIVED AT YOXLEY OLD PLACE A CONSTABLE MET US AT THE GARDEN
GATE
WELL WILSON ANY NEWS
NO SIR NOTHING
NO REPORTS OF ANY STRANGER SEEN
NO SIR DOWN AT THE STATION THEY ARE CERTAIN THAT NO STRANGER
EITHER CAME OR WENT YESTERDAY
HAVE YOU HAD INQUIRIES MADE AT INNS AND LODGINGS
YES SIR THERE IS NO ONE THAT WE CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR
WELL ITS ONLY A REASONABLE WALK TO CHATHAM ANYONE MIGHT STAY
THERE OR TAKE A TRAIN WITHOUT BEING OBSERVED THIS IS THE GARDEN
PATH OF WHICH I SPOKE MR HOLMES ILL PLEDGE MY WORD THERE WAS NO
MARK ON IT YESTERDAY
ON WHICH SIDE WERE THE MARKS ON THE GRASS
THIS SIDE SIR THIS NARROW MARGIN OF GRASS BETWEEN THE PATH AND THE
FLOWERBED I CANT SEE THE TRACES NOW BUT THEY WERE CLEAR TO ME
THEN
YES YES SOMEONE HAS PASSED ALONG SAID HOLMES STOOPING OVER THE
GRASS BORDER OUR LADY MUST HAVE PICKED HER STEPS CAREFULLY MUST
SHE NOT SINCE ON THE ONE SIDE SHE WOULD LEAVE A TRACK ON THE PATH
AND ON THE OTHER AN EVEN CLEARER ONE ON THE SOFT BED
YES SIR SHE MUST HAVE BEEN A COOL HAND
I SAW AN INTENT LOOK PASS OVER HOLMESS FACE
YOU SAY THAT SHE MUST HAVE COME BACK THIS WAY
YES SIR THERE IS NO OTHER
ON THIS STRIP OF GRASS
CERTAINLY MR HOLMES
HUM IT WAS A VERY REMARKABLE PERFORMANCEVERY REMARKABLE WELL I
THINK WE HAVE EXHAUSTED THE PATH LET US GO FARTHER THIS GARDEN DOOR
IS USUALLY KEPT OPEN I SUPPOSE THEN THIS VISITOR HAD NOTHING TO DO
BUT TO WALK IN THE IDEA OF MURDER WAS NOT IN HER MIND OR SHE WOULD
HAVE PROVIDED HERSELF WITH SOME SORT OF WEAPON INSTEAD OF HAVING TO
PICK THIS KNIFE OFF THE WRITINGTABLE SHE ADVANCED ALONG THIS
CORRIDOR LEAVING NO TRACES UPON THE COCOANUT MATTING THEN SHE FOUND
HERSELF IN THIS STUDY HOW LONG WAS SHE THERE WE HAVE NO MEANS OF
JUDGING
NOT MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES SIR I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT MRS
MARKER THE HOUSEKEEPER HAD BEEN IN THERE TIDYING NOT VERY LONG
BEFOREABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE SAYS
WELL THAT GIVES US A LIMIT OUR LADY ENTERS THIS ROOM AND WHAT DOES
SHE DO SHE GOES OVER TO THE WRITINGTABLE WHAT FOR NOT FOR
ANYTHING IN THE DRAWERS IF THERE HAD BEEN ANYTHING WORTH HER TAKING
IT WOULD SURELY HAVE BEEN LOCKED UP NO IT WAS FOR SOMETHING IN THAT
WOODEN BUREAU HALLOA WHAT IS THAT SCRATCH UPON THE FACE OF IT JUST
HOLD A MATCH WATSON WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME OF THIS HOPKINS
THE MARK WHICH HE WAS EXAMINING BEGAN UPON THE BRASS WORK ON THE
RIGHTHAND SIDE OF THE KEYHOLE AND EXTENDED FOR ABOUT FOUR INCHES
WHERE IT HAD SCRATCHED THE VARNISH FROM THE SURFACE
I NOTICED IT MR HOLMES BUT YOULL ALWAYS FIND SCRATCHES ROUND A
KEYHOLE
THIS IS RECENT QUITE RECENT SEE HOW THE BRASS SHINES WHERE IT IS
CUT AN OLD SCRATCH WOULD BE THE SAME COLOUR AS THE SURFACE LOOK AT
IT THROUGH MY LENS THERES THE VARNISH TOO LIKE EARTH ON EACH SIDE
OF A FURROW IS MRS MARKER THERE
A SADFACED ELDERLY WOMAN CAME INTO THE ROOM
DID YOU DUST THIS BUREAU YESTERDAY MORNING
YES SIR
DID YOU NOTICE THIS SCRATCH
NO SIR I DID NOT
I AM SURE YOU DID NOT FOR A DUSTER WOULD HAVE SWEPT AWAY THESE
SHREDS OF VARNISH WHO HAS THE KEY OF THIS BUREAU
THE PROFESSOR KEEPS IT ON HIS WATCHCHAIN
IS IT A SIMPLE KEY
NO SIR IT IS A CHUBBS KEY
VERY GOOD MRS MARKER YOU CAN GO NOW WE ARE MAKING A LITTLE
PROGRESS OUR LADY ENTERS THE ROOM ADVANCES TO THE BUREAU AND
EITHER OPENS IT OR TRIES TO DO SO WHILE SHE IS THUS ENGAGED YOUNG
WILLOUGHBY SMITH ENTERS THE ROOM IN HER HURRY TO WITHDRAW THE KEY
SHE MAKES THIS SCRATCH UPON THE DOOR HE SEIZES HER AND SHE
SNATCHING UP THE NEAREST OBJECT WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THIS KNIFE
STRIKES AT HIM IN ORDER TO MAKE HIM LET GO HIS HOLD THE BLOW IS A
FATAL ONE HE FALLS AND SHE ESCAPES EITHER WITH OR WITHOUT THE
OBJECT FOR WHICH SHE HAS COME IS SUSAN THE MAID THERE COULD ANYONE
HAVE GOT AWAY THROUGH THAT DOOR AFTER THE TIME THAT YOU HEARD THE
CRY SUSAN
NO SIR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE BEFORE I GOT DOWN THE STAIR ID HAVE SEEN
ANYONE IN THE PASSAGE BESIDES THE DOOR NEVER OPENED FOR I WOULD
HAVE HEARD IT
THAT SETTLES THIS EXIT THEN NO DOUBT THE LADY WENT OUT THE WAY SHE
CAME I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS OTHER PASSAGE LEADS ONLY TO THE
PROFESSORS ROOM THERE IS NO EXIT THAT WAY
NO SIR
WE SHALL GO DOWN IT AND MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE PROFESSOR
HALLOA HOPKINS THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT VERY IMPORTANT INDEED THE
PROFESSORS CORRIDOR IS ALSO LINED WITH COCOANUT MATTING
WELL SIR WHAT OF THAT
DONT YOU SEE ANY BEARING UPON THE CASE WELL WELL I DONT INSIST
UPON IT NO DOUBT I AM WRONG AND YET IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE
SUGGESTIVE COME WITH ME AND INTRODUCE ME
WE PASSED DOWN THE PASSAGE WHICH WAS OF THE SAME LENGTH AS THAT
WHICH LED TO THE GARDEN AT THE END WAS A SHORT FLIGHT OF STEPS
ENDING IN A DOOR OUR GUIDE KNOCKED AND THEN USHERED US INTO THE
PROFESSORS BEDROOM
IT WAS A VERY LARGE CHAMBER LINED WITH INNUMERABLE VOLUMES WHICH
HAD OVERFLOWED FROM THE SHELVES AND LAY IN PILES IN THE CORNERS OR
WERE STACKED ALL ROUND AT THE BASE OF THE CASES THE BED WAS IN THE
CENTRE OF THE ROOM AND IN IT PROPPED UP WITH PILLOWS WAS THE OWNER
OF THE HOUSE I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A MORE REMARKABLELOOKING PERSON IT
WAS A GAUNT AQUILINE FACE WHICH WAS TURNED TOWARDS US WITH PIERCING
DARK EYES WHICH LURKED IN DEEP HOLLOWS UNDER OVERHUNG AND TUFTED
BROWS HIS HAIR AND BEARD WERE WHITE SAVE THAT THE LATTER WAS
CURIOUSLY STAINED WITH YELLOW AROUND HIS MOUTH A CIGARETTE GLOWED
AMID THE TANGLE OF WHITE HAIR AND THE AIR OF THE ROOM WAS FETID WITH
STALE TOBACCOSMOKE AS HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO HOLMES I PERCEIVED
THAT IT ALSO WAS STAINED YELLOW WITH NICOTINE
A SMOKER MR HOLMES SAID HE SPEAKING WELLCHOSEN ENGLISH WITH A
CURIOUS LITTLE MINCING ACCENT PRAY TAKE A CIGARETTE AND YOU SIR
I CAN RECOMMEND THEM FOR I HAVE THEM ESPECIALLY PREPARED BY IONIDES
OF ALEXANDRIA HE SENDS ME A THOUSAND AT A TIME AND I GRIEVE TO SAY
THAT I HAVE TO ARRANGE FOR A FRESH SUPPLY EVERY FORTNIGHT BAD SIR
VERY BAD BUT AN OLD MAN HAS FEW PLEASURES TOBACCO AND MY WORKTHAT
IS ALL THAT IS LEFT TO ME
HOLMES HAD LIT A CIGARETTE AND WAS SHOOTING LITTLE DARTING GLANCES
ALL OVER THE ROOM
TOBACCO AND MY WORK BUT NOW ONLY TOBACCO THE OLD MAN EXCLAIMED
ALAS WHAT A FATAL INTERRUPTION WHO COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH A
TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE SO ESTIMABLE A YOUNG MAN I ASSURE YOU THAT
AFTER A FEW MONTHS TRAINING HE WAS AN ADMIRABLE ASSISTANT WHAT DO
YOU THINK OF THE MATTER MR HOLMES
I HAVE NOT YET MADE UP MY MIND
I SHALL INDEED BE INDEBTED TO YOU IF YOU CAN THROW A LIGHT WHERE ALL
IS SO DARK TO US TO A POOR BOOKWORM AND INVALID LIKE MYSELF SUCH A
BLOW IS PARALYZING I SEEM TO HAVE LOST THE FACULTY OF THOUGHT BUT
YOU ARE A MAN OF ACTIONYOU ARE A MAN OF AFFAIRS IT IS PART OF THE
EVERYDAY ROUTINE OF YOUR LIFE YOU CAN PRESERVE YOUR BALANCE IN EVERY
EMERGENCY WE ARE FORTUNATE INDEED IN HAVING YOU AT OUR SIDE
HOLMES WAS PACING UP AND DOWN ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM WHILST THE OLD
PROFESSOR WAS TALKING I OBSERVED THAT HE WAS SMOKING WITH
EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE SHARED OUR HOSTS
LIKING FOR THE FRESH ALEXANDRIAN CIGARETTES
YES SIR IT IS A CRUSHING BLOW SAID THE OLD MAN THAT IS MY
MAGNUM OPUSTHE PILE OF PAPERS ON THE SIDE TABLE YONDER IT IS MY
ANALYSIS OF THE DOCUMENTS FOUND IN THE COPTIC MONASTERIES OF SYRIA
AND EGYPT A WORK WHICH WILL CUT DEEP AT THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF
REVEALED RELIGION WITH MY ENFEEBLED HEALTH I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I
SHALL EVER BE ABLE TO COMPLETE IT NOW THAT MY ASSISTANT HAS BEEN
TAKEN FROM ME DEAR ME MR HOLMES WHY YOU ARE EVEN A QUICKER
SMOKER THAN I AM MYSELF
HOLMES SMILED
I AM A CONNOISSEUR SAID HE TAKING ANOTHER CIGARETTE FROM THE
BOXHIS FOURTHAND LIGHTING IT FROM THE STUB OF THAT WHICH HE HAD
FINISHED I WILL NOT TROUBLE YOU WITH ANY LENGTHY CROSSEXAMINATION
PROFESSOR CORAM SINCE I GATHER THAT YOU WERE IN BED AT THE TIME OF
THE CRIME AND COULD KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT I WOULD ONLY ASK THIS
WHAT DO YOU IMAGINE THAT THIS POOR FELLOW MEANT BY HIS LAST WORDS
THE PROFESSORIT WAS SHE
THE PROFESSOR SHOOK HIS HEAD
SUSAN IS A COUNTRY GIRL SAID HE AND YOU KNOW THE INCREDIBLE
STUPIDITY OF THAT CLASS I FANCY THAT THE POOR FELLOW MURMURED SOME
INCOHERENT DELIRIOUS WORDS AND THAT SHE TWISTED THEM INTO THIS
MEANINGLESS MESSAGE
I SEE YOU HAVE NO EXPLANATION YOURSELF OF THE TRAGEDY
POSSIBLY AN ACCIDENT POSSIBLYI ONLY BREATHE IT AMONG OURSELVESA
SUICIDE YOUNG MEN HAVE THEIR HIDDEN TROUBLESSOME AFFAIR OF THE
HEART PERHAPS WHICH WE HAVE NEVER KNOWN IT IS A MORE PROBABLE
SUPPOSITION THAN MURDER
BUT THE EYEGLASSES
AH I AM ONLY A STUDENTA MAN OF DREAMS I CANNOT EXPLAIN THE
PRACTICAL THINGS OF LIFE BUT STILL WE ARE AWARE MY FRIEND THAT
LOVEGAGES MAY TAKE STRANGE SHAPES BY ALL MEANS TAKE ANOTHER
CIGARETTE IT IS A PLEASURE TO SEE ANYONE APPRECIATE THEM SO A FAN
A GLOVE GLASSESWHO KNOWS WHAT ARTICLE MAY BE CARRIED AS A TOKEN OR
TREASURED WHEN A MAN PUTS AN END TO HIS LIFE THIS GENTLEMAN SPEAKS
OF FOOTSTEPS IN THE GRASS BUT AFTER ALL IT IS EASY TO BE MISTAKEN
ON SUCH A POINT AS TO THE KNIFE IT MIGHT WELL BE THROWN FAR FROM
THE UNFORTUNATE MAN AS HE FELL IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I SPEAK AS A
CHILD BUT TO ME IT SEEMS THAT WILLOUGHBY SMITH HAS MET HIS FATE BY
HIS OWN HAND
HOLMES SEEMED STRUCK BY THE THEORY THUS PUT FORWARD AND HE CONTINUED
TO WALK UP AND DOWN FOR SOME TIME LOST IN THOUGHT AND CONSUMING
CIGARETTE AFTER CIGARETTE
TELL ME PROFESSOR CORAM HE SAID AT LAST WHAT IS IN THAT
CUPBOARD IN THE BUREAU
NOTHING THAT WOULD HELP A THIEF FAMILY PAPERS LETTERS FROM MY POOR
WIFE DIPLOMAS OF UNIVERSITIES WHICH HAVE DONE ME HONOUR HERE IS THE
KEY YOU CAN LOOK FOR YOURSELF
HOLMES PICKED UP THE KEY AND LOOKED AT IT FOR AN INSTANT THEN HE
HANDED IT BACK
NO I HARDLY THINK THAT IT WOULD HELP ME SAID HE I SHOULD PREFER
TO GO QUIETLY DOWN TO YOUR GARDEN AND TURN THE WHOLE MATTER OVER IN
MY HEAD THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THE THEORY OF SUICIDE
WHICH YOU HAVE PUT FORWARD WE MUST APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING INTRUDED
UPON YOU PROFESSOR CORAM AND I PROMISE THAT WE WONT DISTURB YOU
UNTIL AFTER LUNCH AT TWO OCLOCK WE WILL COME AGAIN AND REPORT TO
YOU ANYTHING WHICH MAY HAVE HAPPENED IN THE INTERVAL
HOLMES WAS CURIOUSLY DISTRAIT AND WE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE GARDEN
PATH FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE
HAVE YOU A CLUE I ASKED AT LAST
IT DEPENDS UPON THOSE CIGARETTES THAT I SMOKED SAID HE IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT I AM UTTERLY MISTAKEN THE CIGARETTES WILL SHOW ME
MY DEAR HOLMES I EXCLAIMED HOW ON EARTH
WELL WELL YOU MAY SEE FOR YOURSELF IF NOT THERES NO HARM DONE
OF COURSE WE ALWAYS HAVE THE OPTICIAN CLUE TO FALL BACK UPON BUT I
TAKE A SHORT CUT WHEN I CAN GET IT AH HERE IS THE GOOD MRS MARKER
LET US ENJOY FIVE MINUTES OF INSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH HER
I MAY HAVE REMARKED BEFORE THAT HOLMES HAD WHEN HE LIKED A
PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH WOMEN AND THAT HE VERY READILY
ESTABLISHED TERMS OF CONFIDENCE WITH THEM IN HALF THE TIME WHICH HE
HAD NAMED HE HAD CAPTURED THE HOUSEKEEPERS GOODWILL AND WAS
CHATTING WITH HER AS IF HE HAD KNOWN HER FOR YEARS
YES MR HOLMES IT IS AS YOU SAY SIR HE DOES SMOKE SOMETHING
TERRIBLE ALL DAY AND SOMETIMES ALL NIGHT SIR IVE SEEN THAT ROOM
OF A MORNINGWELL SIR YOUD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS A LONDON FOG POOR
YOUNG MR SMITH HE WAS A SMOKER ALSO BUT NOT AS BAD AS THE
PROFESSOR HIS HEALTHWELL I DONT KNOW THAT ITS BETTER NOR WORSE
FOR THE SMOKING
AH SAID HOLMES BUT IT KILLS THE APPETITE
WELL I DONT KNOW ABOUT THAT SIR
I SUPPOSE THE PROFESSOR EATS HARDLY ANYTHING
WELL HE IS VARIABLE ILL SAY THAT FOR HIM
ILL WAGER HE TOOK NO BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND WONT FACE HIS
LUNCH AFTER ALL THE CIGARETTES I SAW HIM CONSUME
WELL YOURE OUT THERE SIR AS IT HAPPENS FOR HE ATE A REMARKABLE
BIG BREAKFAST THIS MORNING I DONT KNOW WHEN IVE KNOWN HIM MAKE A
BETTER ONE AND HES ORDERED A GOOD DISH OF CUTLETS FOR HIS LUNCH
IM SURPRISED MYSELF FOR SINCE I CAME INTO THAT ROOM YESTERDAY AND
SAW YOUNG MR SMITH LYING THERE ON THE FLOOR I COULDNT BEAR TO LOOK
AT FOOD WELL IT TAKES ALL SORTS TO MAKE A WORLD AND THE PROFESSOR
HASNT LET IT TAKE HIS APPETITE AWAY
WE LOITERED THE MORNING AWAY IN THE GARDEN STANLEY HOPKINS HAD GONE
DOWN TO THE VILLAGE TO LOOK INTO SOME RUMOURS OF A STRANGE WOMAN WHO
HAD BEEN SEEN BY SOME CHILDREN ON THE CHATHAM ROAD THE PREVIOUS
MORNING AS TO MY FRIEND ALL HIS USUAL ENERGY SEEMED TO HAVE
DESERTED HIM I HAD NEVER KNOWN HIM HANDLE A CASE IN SUCH A
HALFHEARTED FASHION EVEN THE NEWS BROUGHT BACK BY HOPKINS THAT HE
HAD FOUND THE CHILDREN AND THAT THEY HAD UNDOUBTEDLY SEEN A WOMAN
EXACTLY CORRESPONDING WITH HOLMESS DESCRIPTION AND WEARING EITHER
SPECTACLES OR EYEGLASSES FAILED TO ROUSE ANY SIGN OF KEEN INTEREST
HE WAS MORE ATTENTIVE WHEN SUSAN WHO WAITED UPON US AT LUNCH
VOLUNTEERED THE INFORMATION THAT SHE BELIEVED MR SMITH HAD BEEN OUT
FOR A WALK YESTERDAY MORNING AND THAT HE HAD ONLY RETURNED HALF AN
HOUR BEFORE THE TRAGEDY OCCURRED I COULD NOT MYSELF SEE THE BEARING
OF THIS INCIDENT BUT I CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT HOLMES WAS WEAVING IT
INTO THE GENERAL SCHEME WHICH HE HAD FORMED IN HIS BRAIN SUDDENLY HE
SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND GLANCED AT HIS WATCH TWO OCLOCK
GENTLEMEN SAID HE WE MUST GO UP AND HAVE IT OUT WITH OUR FRIEND
THE PROFESSOR
THE OLD MAN HAD JUST FINISHED HIS LUNCH AND CERTAINLY HIS EMPTY DISH
BORE EVIDENCE TO THE GOOD APPETITE WITH WHICH HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD
CREDITED HIM HE WAS INDEED A WEIRD FIGURE AS HE TURNED HIS WHITE
MANE AND HIS GLOWING EYES TOWARDS US THE ETERNAL CIGARETTE
SMOULDERED IN HIS MOUTH HE HAD BEEN DRESSED AND WAS SEATED IN AN
ARMCHAIR BY THE FIRE
WELL MR HOLMES HAVE YOU SOLVED THIS MYSTERY YET HE SHOVED THE
LARGE TIN OF CIGARETTES WHICH STOOD ON A TABLE BESIDE HIM TOWARDS MY
COMPANION HOLMES STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AT THE SAME MOMENT AND
BETWEEN THEM THEY TIPPED THE BOX OVER THE EDGE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
WE WERE ALL ON OUR KNEES RETRIEVING STRAY CIGARETTES FROM IMPOSSIBLE
PLACES WHEN WE ROSE AGAIN I OBSERVED THAT HOLMESS EYES WERE SHINING
AND HIS CHEEKS TINGED WITH COLOUR ONLY AT A CRISIS HAVE I SEEN THOSE
BATTLESIGNALS FLYING
YES SAID HE I HAVE SOLVED IT
STANLEY HOPKINS AND I STARED IN AMAZEMENT SOMETHING LIKE A SNEER
QUIVERED OVER THE GAUNT FEATURES OF THE OLD PROFESSOR
INDEED IN THE GARDEN
NO HERE
HERE WHEN
THIS INSTANT
YOU ARE SURELY JOKING MR SHERLOCK HOLMES YOU COMPEL ME TO TELL
YOU THAT THIS IS TOO SERIOUS A MATTER TO BE TREATED IN SUCH A
FASHION
I HAVE FORGED AND TESTED EVERY LINK OF MY CHAIN PROFESSOR CORAM
AND I AM SURE THAT IT IS SOUND WHAT YOUR MOTIVES ARE OR WHAT EXACT
PART YOU PLAY IN THIS STRANGE BUSINESS I AM NOT YET ABLE TO SAY IN A
FEW MINUTES I SHALL PROBABLY HEAR IT FROM YOUR OWN LIPS MEANWHILE I
WILL RECONSTRUCT WHAT IS PAST FOR YOUR BENEFIT SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW
THE INFORMATION WHICH I STILL REQUIRE
A LADY YESTERDAY ENTERED YOUR STUDY SHE CAME WITH THE INTENTION OF
POSSESSING HERSELF OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTS WHICH WERE IN YOUR BUREAU
SHE HAD A KEY OF HER OWN I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING
YOURS AND I DO NOT FIND THAT SLIGHT DISCOLOURATION WHICH THE SCRATCH
MADE UPON THE VARNISH WOULD HAVE PRODUCED YOU WERE NOT AN ACCESSORY
THEREFORE AND SHE CAME SO FAR AS I CAN READ THE EVIDENCE WITHOUT
YOUR KNOWLEDGE TO ROB YOU
THE PROFESSOR BLEW A CLOUD FROM HIS LIPS THIS IS MOST INTERESTING
AND INSTRUCTIVE SAID HE HAVE YOU NO MORE TO ADD SURELY HAVING
TRACED THIS LADY SO FAR YOU CAN ALSO SAY WHAT HAS BECOME OF HER
I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO DO SO IN THE FIRST PLACE SHE WAS SEIZED BY YOUR
SECRETARY AND STABBED HIM IN ORDER TO ESCAPE THIS CATASTROPHE I AM
INCLINED TO REGARD AS AN UNHAPPY ACCIDENT FOR I AM CONVINCED THAT
THE LADY HAD NO INTENTION OF INFLICTING SO GRIEVOUS AN INJURY AN
ASSASSIN DOES NOT COME UNARMED HORRIFIED BY WHAT SHE HAD DONE SHE
RUSHED WILDLY AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF THE TRAGEDY UNFORTUNATELY FOR
HER SHE HAD LOST HER GLASSES IN THE SCUFFLE AND AS SHE WAS EXTREMELY
SHORTSIGHTED SHE WAS REALLY HELPLESS WITHOUT THEM SHE RAN DOWN A
CORRIDOR WHICH SHE IMAGINED TO BE THAT BY WHICH SHE HAD COMEBOTH
WERE LINED WITH COCOANUT MATTINGAND IT WAS ONLY WHEN IT WAS TOO
LATE THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE HAD TAKEN THE WRONG PASSAGE AND
THAT HER RETREAT WAS CUT OFF BEHIND HER WHAT WAS SHE TO DO SHE
COULD NOT GO BACK SHE COULD NOT REMAIN WHERE SHE WAS SHE MUST GO
ON SHE WENT ON SHE MOUNTED A STAIR PUSHED OPEN A DOOR AND FOUND
HERSELF IN YOUR ROOM
THE OLD MAN SAT WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN STARING WILDLY AT HOLMES
AMAZEMENT AND FEAR WERE STAMPED UPON HIS EXPRESSIVE FEATURES NOW
WITH AN EFFORT HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND BURST INTO INSINCERE
LAUGHTER
ALL VERY FINE MR HOLMES SAID HE BUT THERE IS ONE LITTLE FLAW
IN YOUR SPLENDID THEORY I WAS MYSELF IN MY ROOM AND I NEVER LEFT IT
DURING THE DAY
I AM AWARE OF THAT PROFESSOR CORAM
AND YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT I COULD LIE UPON THAT BED AND NOT BE AWARE
THAT A WOMAN HAD ENTERED MY ROOM
I NEVER SAID SO YOU WERE AWARE OF IT YOU SPOKE WITH HER YOU
RECOGNISED HER YOU AIDED HER TO ESCAPE
AGAIN THE PROFESSOR BURST INTO HIGHKEYED LAUGHTER HE HAD RISEN TO
HIS FEET AND HIS EYES GLOWED LIKE EMBERS
YOU ARE MAD HE CRIED YOU ARE TALKING INSANELY I HELPED HER TO
ESCAPE WHERE IS SHE NOW
SHE IS THERE SAID HOLMES AND HE POINTED TO A HIGH BOOKCASE IN THE
CORNER OF THE ROOM
I SAW THE OLD MAN THROW UP HIS ARMS A TERRIBLE CONVULSION PASSED
OVER HIS GRIM FACE AND HE FELL BACK IN HIS CHAIR AT THE SAME
INSTANT THE BOOKCASE AT WHICH HOLMES POINTED SWUNG ROUND UPON A
HINGE AND A WOMAN RUSHED OUT INTO THE ROOM YOU ARE RIGHT SHE
CRIED IN A STRANGE FOREIGN VOICE YOU ARE RIGHT I AM HERE
SHE WAS BROWN WITH THE DUST AND DRAPED WITH THE COBWEBS WHICH HAD
COME FROM THE WALLS OF HER HIDINGPLACE HER FACE TOO WAS STREAKED
WITH GRIME AND AT THE BEST SHE COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN HANDSOME FOR
SHE HAD THE EXACT PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS WHICH HOLMES HAD DIVINED
WITH IN ADDITION A LONG AND OBSTINATE CHIN WHAT WITH HER NATURAL
BLINDNESS AND WHAT WITH THE CHANGE FROM DARK TO LIGHT SHE STOOD AS
ONE DAZED BLINKING ABOUT HER TO SEE WHERE AND WHO WE WERE AND YET
IN SPITE OF ALL THESE DISADVANTAGES THERE WAS A CERTAIN NOBILITY IN
THE WOMANS BEARING A GALLANTRY IN THE DEFIANT CHIN AND IN THE
UPRAISED HEAD WHICH COMPELLED SOMETHING OF RESPECT AND ADMIRATION
STANLEY HOPKINS HAD LAID HIS HAND UPON HER ARM AND CLAIMED HER AS HIS
PRISONER BUT SHE WAVED HIM ASIDE GENTLY AND YET WITH AN
OVERMASTERING DIGNITY WHICH COMPELLED OBEDIENCE THE OLD MAN LAY BACK
IN HIS CHAIR WITH A TWITCHING FACE AND STARED AT HER WITH BROODING
EYES
YES SIR I AM YOUR PRISONER SHE SAID FROM WHERE I STOOD I COULD
HEAR EVERYTHING AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED THE TRUTH I
CONFESS IT ALL IT WAS I WHO KILLED THE YOUNG MAN BUT YOU ARE RIGHT
YOU WHO SAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT I DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT IT WAS A
KNIFE WHICH I HELD IN MY HAND FOR IN MY DESPAIR I SNATCHED ANYTHING
FROM THE TABLE AND STRUCK AT HIM TO MAKE HIM LET ME GO IT IS THE
TRUTH THAT I TELL
MADAM SAID HOLMES I AM SURE THAT IT IS THE TRUTH I FEAR THAT
YOU ARE FAR FROM WELL
SHE HAD TURNED A DREADFUL COLOUR THE MORE GHASTLY UNDER THE DARK
DUSTSTREAKS UPON HER FACE SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE SIDE OF THE
BED THEN SHE RESUMED
I HAVE ONLY A LITTLE TIME HERE SHE SAID BUT I WOULD HAVE YOU TO
KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH I AM THIS MANS WIFE HE IS NOT AN ENGLISHMAN
HE IS A RUSSIAN HIS NAME I WILL NOT TELL
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OLD MAN STIRRED GOD BLESS YOU ANNA HE
CRIED GOD BLESS YOU
SHE CAST A LOOK OF THE DEEPEST DISDAIN IN HIS DIRECTION WHY SHOULD
YOU CLING SO HARD TO THAT WRETCHED LIFE OF YOURS SERGIUS SAID SHE
IT HAS DONE HARM TO MANY AND GOOD TO NONENOT EVEN TO YOURSELF
HOWEVER IT IS NOT FOR ME TO CAUSE THE FRAIL THREAD TO BE SNAPPED
BEFORE GODS TIME I HAVE ENOUGH ALREADY UPON MY SOUL SINCE I CROSSED
THE THRESHOLD OF THIS CURSED HOUSE BUT I MUST SPEAK OR I SHALL BE
TOO LATE
I HAVE SAID GENTLEMEN THAT I AM THIS MANS WIFE HE WAS FIFTY AND
I A FOOLISH GIRL OF TWENTY WHEN WE MARRIED IT WAS IN A CITY OF
RUSSIA A UNIVERSITYI WILL NOT NAME THE PLACE
GOD BLESS YOU ANNA MURMURED THE OLD MAN AGAIN
WE WERE REFORMERSREVOLUTIONISTSNIHILISTS YOU UNDERSTAND HE AND
I AND MANY MORE THEN THERE CAME A TIME OF TROUBLE A POLICE OFFICER
WAS KILLED MANY WERE ARRESTED EVIDENCE WAS WANTED AND IN ORDER TO
SAVE HIS OWN LIFE AND TO EARN A GREAT REWARD MY HUSBAND BETRAYED HIS
OWN WIFE AND HIS COMPANIONS YES WE WERE ALL ARRESTED UPON HIS
CONFESSION SOME OF US FOUND OUR WAY TO THE GALLOWS AND SOME TO
SIBERIA I WAS AMONG THESE LAST BUT MY TERM WAS NOT FOR LIFE MY
HUSBAND CAME TO ENGLAND WITH HIS ILLGOTTEN GAINS AND HAS LIVED IN
QUIET EVER SINCE KNOWING WELL THAT IF THE BROTHERHOOD KNEW WHERE HE
WAS NOT A WEEK WOULD PASS BEFORE JUSTICE WOULD BE DONE
THE OLD MAN REACHED OUT A TREMBLING HAND AND HELPED HIMSELF TO A
CIGARETTE I AM IN YOUR HANDS ANNA SAID HE YOU WERE ALWAYS GOOD
TO ME
I HAVE NOT YET TOLD YOU THE HEIGHT OF HIS VILLAINY SAID SHE
AMONG OUR COMRADES OF THE ORDER THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS THE FRIEND OF
MY HEART HE WAS NOBLE UNSELFISH LOVINGALL THAT MY HUSBAND WAS
NOT HE HATED VIOLENCE WE WERE ALL GUILTYIF THAT IS GUILTBUT HE
WAS NOT HE WROTE FOR EVER DISSUADING US FROM SUCH A COURSE THESE
LETTERS WOULD HAVE SAVED HIM SO WOULD MY DIARY IN WHICH FROM DAY TO
DAY I HAD ENTERED BOTH MY FEELINGS TOWARDS HIM AND THE VIEW WHICH
EACH OF US HAD TAKEN MY HUSBAND FOUND AND KEPT BOTH DIARY AND
LETTERS HE HID THEM AND HE TRIED HARD TO SWEAR AWAY THE YOUNG MANS
LIFE IN THIS HE FAILED BUT ALEXIS WAS SENT A CONVICT TO SIBERIA
WHERE NOW AT THIS MOMENT HE WORKS IN A SALT MINE THINK OF THAT
YOU VILLAIN YOU VILLAIN NOW NOW AT THIS VERY MOMENT ALEXIS A
MAN WHOSE NAME YOU ARE NOT WORTHY TO SPEAK WORKS AND LIVES LIKE A
SLAVE AND YET I HAVE YOUR LIFE IN MY HANDS AND I LET YOU GO
YOU WERE ALWAYS A NOBLE WOMAN ANNA SAID THE OLD MAN PUFFING AT
HIS CIGARETTE
SHE HAD RISEN BUT SHE FELL BACK AGAIN WITH A LITTLE CRY OF PAIN
I MUST FINISH SHE SAID WHEN MY TERM WAS OVER I SET MYSELF TO GET
THE DIARY AND LETTERS WHICH IF SENT TO THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD
PROCURE MY FRIENDS RELEASE I KNEW THAT MY HUSBAND HAD COME TO
ENGLAND AFTER MONTHS OF SEARCHING I DISCOVERED WHERE HE WAS I KNEW
THAT HE STILL HAD THE DIARY FOR WHEN I WAS IN SIBERIA I HAD A LETTER
FROM HIM ONCE REPROACHING ME AND QUOTING SOME PASSAGES FROM ITS
PAGES YET I WAS SURE THAT WITH HIS REVENGEFUL NATURE HE WOULD NEVER
GIVE IT TO ME OF HIS OWN FREE WILL I MUST GET IT FOR MYSELF WITH
THIS OBJECT I ENGAGED AN AGENT FROM A PRIVATE DETECTIVE FIRM WHO
ENTERED MY HUSBANDS HOUSE AS SECRETARYIT WAS YOUR SECOND
SECRETARY SERGIUS THE ONE WHO LEFT YOU SO HURRIEDLY HE FOUND THAT
PAPERS WERE KEPT IN THE CUPBOARD AND HE GOT AN IMPRESSION OF THE
KEY HE WOULD NOT GO FARTHER HE FURNISHED ME WITH A PLAN OF THE
HOUSE AND HE TOLD ME THAT IN THE FORENOON THE STUDY WAS ALWAYS
EMPTY AS THE SECRETARY WAS EMPLOYED UP HERE SO AT LAST I TOOK MY
COURAGE IN BOTH HANDS AND I CAME DOWN TO GET THE PAPERS FOR MYSELF I
SUCCEEDED BUT AT WHAT A COST
I HAD JUST TAKEN THE PAPERS AND WAS LOCKING THE CUPBOARD WHEN THE
YOUNG MAN SEIZED ME I HAD SEEN HIM ALREADY THAT MORNING HE HAD MET
ME IN THE ROAD AND I HAD ASKED HIM TO TELL ME WHERE PROFESSOR CORAM
LIVED NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS IN HIS EMPLOY
EXACTLY EXACTLY SAID HOLMES THE SECRETARY CAME BACK AND TOLD
HIS EMPLOYER OF THE WOMAN HE HAD MET THEN IN HIS LAST BREATH HE
TRIED TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT IT WAS SHETHE SHE WHOM HE HAD JUST
DISCUSSED WITH HIM
YOU MUST LET ME SPEAK SAID THE WOMAN IN AN IMPERATIVE VOICE AND
HER FACE CONTRACTED AS IF IN PAIN WHEN HE HAD FALLEN I RUSHED FROM
THE ROOM CHOSE THE WRONG DOOR AND FOUND MYSELF IN MY HUSBANDS
ROOM HE SPOKE OF GIVING ME UP I SHOWED HIM THAT IF HE DID SO HIS
LIFE WAS IN MY HANDS IF HE GAVE ME TO THE LAW I COULD GIVE HIM TO
THE BROTHERHOOD IT WAS NOT THAT I WISHED TO LIVE FOR MY OWN SAKE
BUT IT WAS THAT I DESIRED TO ACCOMPLISH MY PURPOSE HE KNEW THAT I
WOULD DO WHAT I SAIDTHAT HIS OWN FATE WAS INVOLVED IN MINE FOR
THAT REASON AND FOR NO OTHER HE SHIELDED ME HE THRUST ME INTO THAT
DARK HIDINGPLACE A RELIC OF OLD DAYS KNOWN ONLY TO HIMSELF HE
TOOK HIS MEALS IN HIS OWN ROOM AND SO WAS ABLE TO GIVE ME PART OF
HIS FOOD IT WAS AGREED THAT WHEN THE POLICE LEFT THE HOUSE I SHOULD
SLIP AWAY BY NIGHT AND COME BACK NO MORE BUT IN SOME WAY YOU HAVE
READ OUR PLANS SHE TORE FROM THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS A SMALL PACKET
THESE ARE MY LAST WORDS SAID SHE HERE IS THE PACKET WHICH WILL
SAVE ALEXIS I CONFIDE IT TO YOUR HONOUR AND TO YOUR LOVE OF JUSTICE
TAKE IT YOU WILL DELIVER IT AT THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY NOW I HAVE DONE
MY DUTY AND
STOP HER CRIED HOLMES HE HAD BOUNDED ACROSS THE ROOM AND HAD
WRENCHED A SMALL PHIAL FROM HER HAND
TOO LATE SHE SAID SINKING BACK ON THE BED TOO LATE I TOOK THE
POISON BEFORE I LEFT MY HIDINGPLACE MY HEAD SWIMS I AM GOING I
CHARGE YOU SIR TO REMEMBER THE PACKET
A SIMPLE CASE AND YET IN SOME WAYS AN INSTRUCTIVE ONE HOLMES
REMARKED AS WE TRAVELLED BACK TO TOWN IT HINGED FROM THE OUTSET
UPON THE PINCENEZ BUT FOR THE FORTUNATE CHANCE OF THE DYING MAN
HAVING SEIZED THESE I AM NOT SURE THAT WE COULD EVER HAVE REACHED OUR
SOLUTION IT WAS CLEAR TO ME FROM THE STRENGTH OF THE GLASSES THAT
THE WEARER MUST HAVE BEEN VERY BLIND AND HELPLESS WHEN DEPRIVED OF
THEM WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WALKED ALONG A NARROW
STRIP OF GRASS WITHOUT ONCE MAKING A FALSE STEP I REMARKED AS YOU
MAY REMEMBER THAT IT WAS A NOTEWORTHY PERFORMANCE IN MY MIND I SET
IT DOWN AS AN IMPOSSIBLE PERFORMANCE SAVE IN THE UNLIKELY CASE THAT
SHE HAD A SECOND PAIR OF GLASSES I WAS FORCED THEREFORE TO
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SHE HAD REMAINED WITHIN THE
HOUSE ON PERCEIVING THE SIMILARITY OF THE TWO CORRIDORS IT BECAME
CLEAR THAT SHE MIGHT VERY EASILY HAVE MADE SUCH A MISTAKE AND IN
THAT CASE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE MUST HAVE ENTERED THE PROFESSORS
ROOM I WAS KEENLY ON THE ALERT THEREFORE FOR WHATEVER WOULD BEAR
OUT THIS SUPPOSITION AND I EXAMINED THE ROOM NARROWLY FOR ANYTHING
IN THE SHAPE OF A HIDINGPLACE THE CARPET SEEMED CONTINUOUS AND
FIRMLY NAILED SO I DISMISSED THE IDEA OF A TRAPDOOR THERE MIGHT
WELL BE A RECESS BEHIND THE BOOKS AS YOU ARE AWARE SUCH DEVICES ARE
COMMON IN OLD LIBRARIES I OBSERVED THAT BOOKS WERE PILED ON THE
FLOOR AT ALL OTHER POINTS BUT THAT ONE BOOKCASE WAS LEFT CLEAR
THIS THEN MIGHT BE THE DOOR I COULD SEE NO MARKS TO GUIDE ME BUT
THE CARPET WAS OF A DUN COLOUR WHICH LENDS ITSELF VERY WELL TO
EXAMINATION I THEREFORE SMOKED A GREAT NUMBER OF THOSE EXCELLENT
CIGARETTES AND I DROPPED THE ASH ALL OVER THE SPACE IN FRONT OF THE
SUSPECTED BOOKCASE IT WAS A SIMPLE TRICK BUT EXCEEDINGLY EFFECTIVE
I THEN WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND I ASCERTAINED IN YOUR PRESENCE WATSON
WITHOUT YOUR PERCEIVING THE DRIFT OF MY REMARKS THAT PROFESSOR
CORAMS CONSUMPTION OF FOOD HAD INCREASEDAS ONE WOULD EXPECT WHEN
HE IS SUPPLYING A SECOND PERSON WE THEN ASCENDED TO THE ROOM AGAIN
WHEN BY UPSETTING THE CIGARETTEBOX I OBTAINED A VERY EXCELLENT
VIEW OF THE FLOOR AND WAS ABLE TO SEE QUITE CLEARLY FROM THE TRACES
UPON THE CIGARETTE ASH THAT THE PRISONER HAD IN OUR ABSENCE COME
OUT FROM HER RETREAT WELL HOPKINS HERE WE ARE AT CHARING CROSS
AND I CONGRATULATE YOU ON HAVING BROUGHT YOUR CASE TO A SUCCESSFUL
CONCLUSION YOU ARE GOING TO HEADQUARTERS NO DOUBT I THINK
WATSON YOU AND I WILL DRIVE TOGETHER TO THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY
THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREEQUARTER
WE WERE FAIRLY ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE WEIRD TELEGRAMS AT BAKER STREET
BUT I HAVE A PARTICULAR RECOLLECTION OF ONE WHICH REACHED US ON A
GLOOMY FEBRUARY MORNING SOME SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO AND GAVE MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES A PUZZLED QUARTER OF AN HOUR IT WAS ADDRESSED TO
HIM AND RAN THUS
PLEASE AWAIT ME TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE RIGHT WING THREEQUARTER
MISSING INDISPENSABLE TOMORROW
OVERTON
STRAND POSTMARK AND DISPATCHED TENTHIRTYSIX SAID HOLMES
READING IT OVER AND OVER MR OVERTON WAS EVIDENTLY CONSIDERABLY
EXCITED WHEN HE SENT IT AND SOMEWHAT INCOHERENT IN CONSEQUENCE
WELL WELL HE WILL BE HERE I DARE SAY BY THE TIME I HAVE LOOKED
THROUGH THE TIMES AND THEN WE SHALL KNOW ALL ABOUT IT EVEN THE MOST
INSIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WOULD BE WELCOME IN THESE STAGNANT DAYS
THINGS HAD INDEED BEEN VERY SLOW WITH US AND I HAD LEARNED TO DREAD
SUCH PERIODS OF INACTION FOR I KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT MY
COMPANIONS BRAIN WAS SO ABNORMALLY ACTIVE THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO
LEAVE IT WITHOUT MATERIAL UPON WHICH TO WORK FOR YEARS I HAD
GRADUALLY WEANED HIM FROM THAT DRUG MANIA WHICH HAD THREATENED ONCE
TO CHECK HIS REMARKABLE CAREER NOW I KNEW THAT UNDER ORDINARY
CONDITIONS HE NO LONGER CRAVED FOR THIS ARTIFICIAL STIMULUS BUT I
WAS WELL AWARE THAT THE FIEND WAS NOT DEAD BUT SLEEPING AND I HAVE
KNOWN THAT THE SLEEP WAS A LIGHT ONE AND THE WAKING NEAR WHEN IN
PERIODS OF IDLENESS I HAVE SEEN THE DRAWN LOOK UPON HOLMESS ASCETIC
FACE AND THE BROODING OF HIS DEEPSET AND INSCRUTABLE EYES
THEREFORE I BLESSED THIS MR OVERTON WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE SINCE HE
HAD COME WITH HIS ENIGMATIC MESSAGE TO BREAK THAT DANGEROUS CALM
WHICH BROUGHT MORE PERIL TO MY FRIEND THAN ALL THE STORMS OF HIS
TEMPESTUOUS LIFE
AS WE HAD EXPECTED THE TELEGRAM WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY ITS SENDER AND
THE CARD OF MR CYRIL OVERTON OF TRINITY COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE
ANNOUNCED THE ARRIVAL OF AN ENORMOUS YOUNG MAN SIXTEEN STONE OF
SOLID BONE AND MUSCLE WHO SPANNED THE DOORWAY WITH HIS BROAD
SHOULDERS AND LOOKED FROM ONE OF US TO THE OTHER WITH A COMELY FACE
WHICH WAS HAGGARD WITH ANXIETY
MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
MY COMPANION BOWED
IVE BEEN DOWN TO SCOTLAND YARD MR HOLMES I SAW INSPECTOR STANLEY
HOPKINS HE ADVISED ME TO COME TO YOU HE SAID THE CASE SO FAR AS HE

RESERVE BUT HE IS TRAINED AS A HALF AND HE ALWAYS EDGES RIGHT IN ON
TO THE SCRUM INSTEAD OF KEEPING OUT ON THE TOUCHLINE HES A FINE
PLACEKICK ITS TRUE BUT THEN HE HAS NO JUDGMENT AND HE CANT
SPRINT FOR NUTS WHY MORTON OR JOHNSON THE OXFORD FLIERS COULD
ROMP ROUND HIM STEVENSON IS FAST ENOUGH BUT HE COULDNT DROP FROM
THE TWENTYFIVE LINE AND A THREEQUARTER WHO CANT EITHER PUNT OR
DROP ISNT WORTH A PLACE FOR PACE ALONE NO MR HOLMES WE ARE DONE
UNLESS YOU CAN HELP ME TO FIND GODFREY STAUNTON
MY FRIEND HAD LISTENED WITH AMUSED SURPRISE TO THIS LONG SPEECH
WHICH WAS POURED FORTH WITH EXTRAORDINARY VIGOUR AND EARNESTNESS
EVERY POINT BEING DRIVEN HOME BY THE SLAPPING OF A BRAWNY HAND UPON
THE SPEAKERS KNEE WHEN OUR VISITOR WAS SILENT HOLMES STRETCHED OUT
HIS HAND AND TOOK DOWN LETTER S OF HIS COMMONPLACE BOOK FOR ONCE
HE DUG IN VAIN INTO THAT MINE OF VARIED INFORMATION
THERE IS ARTHUR H STAUNTON THE RISING YOUNG FORGER SAID HE AND
THERE WAS HENRY STAUNTON WHOM I HELPED TO HANG BUT GODFREY STAUNTON
IS A NEW NAME TO ME
IT WAS OUR VISITORS TURN TO LOOK SURPRISED
WHY MR HOLMES I THOUGHT YOU KNEW THINGS SAID HE I SUPPOSE
THEN IF YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF GODFREY STAUNTON YOU DONT KNOW
CYRIL OVERTON EITHER
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD GOODHUMOUREDLY
GREAT SCOT CRIED THE ATHLETE WHY I WAS FIRST RESERVE FOR
ENGLAND AGAINST WALES AND IVE SKIPPERED THE VARSITY ALL THIS YEAR
BUT THATS NOTHING I DIDNT THINK THERE WAS A SOUL IN ENGLAND WHO
DIDNT KNOW GODFREY STAUNTON THE CRACK THREEQUARTER CAMBRIDGE
BLACKHEATH AND FIVE INTERNATIONALS GOOD LORD MR HOLMES WHERE
HAVE YOU LIVED
HOLMES LAUGHED AT THE YOUNG GIANTS NAIVE ASTONISHMENT
YOU LIVE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD TO ME MR OVERTON A SWEETER AND
HEALTHIER ONE MY RAMIFICATIONS STRETCH OUT INTO MANY SECTIONS OF
SOCIETY BUT NEVER I AM HAPPY TO SAY INTO AMATEUR SPORT WHICH IS
THE BEST AND SOUNDEST THING IN ENGLAND HOWEVER YOUR UNEXPECTED
VISIT THIS MORNING SHOWS ME THAT EVEN IN THAT WORLD OF FRESH AIR AND
FAIR PLAY THERE MAY BE WORK FOR ME TO DO SO NOW MY GOOD SIR I BEG
YOU TO SIT DOWN AND TO TELL ME SLOWLY AND QUIETLY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
THAT HAS OCCURRED AND HOW YOU DESIRE THAT I SHOULD HELP YOU
YOUNG OVERTONS FACE ASSUMED THE BOTHERED LOOK OF THE MAN WHO IS MORE
ACCUSTOMED TO USING HIS MUSCLES THAN HIS WITS BUT BY DEGREES WITH
MANY REPETITIONS AND OBSCURITIES WHICH I MAY OMIT FROM HIS NARRATIVE
HE LAID HIS STRANGE STORY BEFORE US
ITS THIS WAY MR HOLMES AS I HAVE SAID I AM THE SKIPPER OF THE
RUGGER TEAM OF CAMBRIDGE VARSITY AND GODFREY STAUNTON IS MY BEST
MAN TOMORROW WE PLAY OXFORD YESTERDAY WE ALL CAME UP AND WE
SETTLED AT BENTLEYS PRIVATE HOTEL AT TEN OCLOCK I WENT ROUND AND
SAW THAT ALL THE FELLOWS HAD GONE TO ROOST FOR I BELIEVE IN STRICT
TRAINING AND PLENTY OF SLEEP TO KEEP A TEAM FIT I HAD A WORD OR TWO
WITH GODFREY BEFORE HE TURNED IN HE SEEMED TO ME TO BE PALE AND
BOTHERED I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER HE SAID HE WAS ALL
RIGHTJUST A TOUCH OF HEADACHE I BADE HIM GOODNIGHT AND LEFT HIM
HALF AN HOUR LATER THE PORTER TELLS ME THAT A ROUGHLOOKING MAN WITH
A BEARD CALLED WITH A NOTE FOR GODFREY HE HAD NOT GONE TO BED AND
THE NOTE WAS TAKEN TO HIS ROOM GODFREY READ IT AND FELL BACK IN A
CHAIR AS IF HE HAD BEEN POLEAXED THE PORTER WAS SO SCARED THAT HE
WAS GOING TO FETCH ME BUT GODFREY STOPPED HIM HAD A DRINK OF WATER
AND PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER THEN HE WENT DOWNSTAIRS SAID A FEW
WORDS TO THE MAN WHO WAS WAITING IN THE HALL AND THE TWO OF THEM
WENT OFF TOGETHER THE LAST THAT THE PORTER SAW OF THEM THEY WERE
ALMOST RUNNING DOWN THE STREET IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STRAND THIS
MORNING GODFREYS ROOM WAS EMPTY HIS BED HAD NEVER BEEN SLEPT IN
AND HIS THINGS WERE ALL JUST AS I HAD SEEN THEM THE NIGHT BEFORE HE
HAD GONE OFF AT A MOMENTS NOTICE WITH THIS STRANGER AND NO WORD HAS
COME FROM HIM SINCE I DONT BELIEVE HE WILL EVER COME BACK HE WAS A
SPORTSMAN WAS GODFREY DOWN TO HIS MARROW AND HE WOULDNT HAVE
STOPPED HIS TRAINING AND LET IN HIS SKIPPER IF IT WERE NOT FOR SOME
CAUSE THAT WAS TOO STRONG FOR HIM NO I FEEL AS IF HE WERE GONE FOR
GOOD AND WE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN
SHERLOCK HOLMES LISTENED WITH THE DEEPEST ATTENTION TO THIS SINGULAR
NARRATIVE
WHAT DID YOU DO HE ASKED
I WIRED TO CAMBRIDGE TO LEARN IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN HEARD OF HIM
THERE I HAVE HAD AN ANSWER NO ONE HAS SEEN HIM
COULD HE HAVE GOT BACK TO CAMBRIDGE
YES THERE IS A LATE TRAINQUARTERPAST ELEVEN
BUT SO FAR AS YOU CAN ASCERTAIN HE DID NOT TAKE IT
NO HE HAS NOT BEEN SEEN
WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT
I WIRED TO LORD MOUNTJAMES
WHY TO LORD MOUNTJAMES
GODFREY IS AN ORPHAN AND LORD MOUNTJAMES IS HIS NEAREST
RELATIVEHIS UNCLE I BELIEVE
INDEED THIS THROWS NEW LIGHT UPON THE MATTER LORD MOUNTJAMES IS
ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN IN ENGLAND
SO IVE HEARD GODFREY SAY
AND YOUR FRIEND WAS CLOSELY RELATED
YES HE WAS HIS HEIR AND THE OLD BOY IS NEARLY EIGHTYCRAM FULL OF
GOUT TOO THEY SAY HE COULD CHALK HIS BILLIARDCUE WITH HIS
KNUCKLES HE NEVER ALLOWED GODFREY A SHILLING IN HIS LIFE FOR HE IS
AN ABSOLUTE MISER BUT IT WILL ALL COME TO HIM RIGHT ENOUGH
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM LORD MOUNTJAMES
NO
WHAT MOTIVE COULD YOUR FRIEND HAVE IN GOING TO LORD MOUNTJAMES
WELL SOMETHING WAS WORRYING HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE AND IF IT WAS TO
DO WITH MONEY IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE WOULD MAKE FOR HIS NEAREST
RELATIVE WHO HAD SO MUCH OF IT THOUGH FROM ALL I HAVE HEARD HE WOULD
NOT HAVE MUCH CHANCE OF GETTING IT GODFREY WAS NOT FOND OF THE OLD
MAN HE WOULD NOT GO IF HE COULD HELP IT
WELL WE CAN SOON DETERMINE THAT IF YOUR FRIEND WAS GOING TO HIS
RELATIVE LORD MOUNTJAMES YOU HAVE THEN TO EXPLAIN THE VISIT OF
THIS ROUGHLOOKING FELLOW AT SO LATE AN HOUR AND THE AGITATION THAT
WAS CAUSED BY HIS COMING
CYRIL OVERTON PRESSED HIS HANDS TO HIS HEAD I CAN MAKE NOTHING OF
IT SAID HE
WELL WELL I HAVE A CLEAR DAY AND I SHALL BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO
THE MATTER SAID HOLMES I SHOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TO MAKE
YOUR PREPARATIONS FOR YOUR MATCH WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THIS YOUNG
GENTLEMAN IT MUST AS YOU SAY HAVE BEEN AN OVERPOWERING NECESSITY
WHICH TORE HIM AWAY IN SUCH A FASHION AND THE SAME NECESSITY IS
LIKELY TO HOLD HIM AWAY LET US STEP ROUND TOGETHER TO THIS HOTEL
AND SEE IF THE PORTER CAN THROW ANY FRESH LIGHT UPON THE MATTER
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS A PASTMASTER IN THE ART OF PUTTING A HUMBLE
WITNESS AT HIS EASE AND VERY SOON IN THE PRIVACY OF GODFREY
STAUNTONS ABANDONED ROOM HE HAD EXTRACTED ALL THAT THE PORTER HAD
TO TELL THE VISITOR OF THE NIGHT BEFORE WAS NOT A GENTLEMAN NEITHER
WAS HE A WORKING MAN HE WAS SIMPLY WHAT THE PORTER DESCRIBED AS A
MEDIUMLOOKING CHAP A MAN OF FIFTY BEARD GRIZZLED PALE FACE
QUIETLY DRESSED HE SEEMED HIMSELF TO BE AGITATED THE PORTER HAD
OBSERVED HIS HAND TREMBLING WHEN HE HAD HELD OUT THE NOTE GODFREY
STAUNTON HAD CRAMMED THE NOTE INTO HIS POCKET STAUNTON HAD NOT
SHAKEN HANDS WITH THE MAN IN THE HALL THEY HAD EXCHANGED A FEW
SENTENCES OF WHICH THE PORTER HAD ONLY DISTINGUISHED THE ONE WORD
TIME THEN THEY HAD HURRIED OFF IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED IT WAS
JUST HALFPAST TEN BY THE HALL CLOCK
LET ME SEE SAID HOLMES SEATING HIMSELF ON STAUNTONS BED YOU
ARE THE DAY PORTER ARE YOU NOT
YES SIR I GO OFF DUTY AT ELEVEN
THE NIGHT PORTER SAW NOTHING I SUPPOSE
NO SIR ONE THEATRE PARTY CAME IN LATE NO ONE ELSE
WERE YOU ON DUTY ALL DAY YESTERDAY
YES SIR
DID YOU TAKE ANY MESSAGES TO MR STAUNTON
YES SIR ONE TELEGRAM
AH THATS INTERESTING WHAT OCLOCK WAS THIS
ABOUT SIX
WHERE WAS MR STAUNTON WHEN HE RECEIVED IT
HERE IN HIS ROOM
WERE YOU PRESENT WHEN HE OPENED IT
YES SIR I WAITED TO SEE IF THERE WAS AN ANSWER
WELL WAS THERE
YES SIR HE WROTE AN ANSWER
DID YOU TAKE IT
NO HE TOOK IT HIMSELF
BUT HE WROTE IT IN YOUR PRESENCE
YES SIR I WAS STANDING BY THE DOOR AND HE WITH HIS BACK TURNED AT
THAT TABLE WHEN HE HAD WRITTEN IT HE SAID ALL RIGHT PORTER I
WILL TAKE THIS MYSELF
WHAT DID HE WRITE IT WITH
A PEN SIR
WAS THE TELEGRAPHIC FORM ONE OF THESE ON THE TABLE
YES SIR IT WAS THE TOP ONE
HOLMES ROSE TAKING THE FORMS HE CARRIED THEM OVER TO THE WINDOW AND
CAREFULLY EXAMINED THAT WHICH WAS UPPERMOST
IT IS A PITY HE DID NOT WRITE IN PENCIL SAID HE THROWING THEM
DOWN AGAIN WITH A SHRUG OF DISAPPOINTMENT AS YOU HAVE NO DOUBT
FREQUENTLY OBSERVED WATSON THE IMPRESSION USUALLY GOES THROUGHA
FACT WHICH HAS DISSOLVED MANY A HAPPY MARRIAGE HOWEVER I CAN FIND
NO TRACE HERE I REJOICE HOWEVER TO PERCEIVE THAT HE WROTE WITH A
BROADPOINTED QUILL PEN AND I CAN HARDLY DOUBT THAT WE WILL FIND
SOME IMPRESSION UPON THIS BLOTTINGPAD AH YES SURELY THIS IS THE
VERY THING
HE TORE OFF A STRIP OF THE BLOTTINGPAPER AND TURNED TOWARDS US THE
FOLLOWING HIEROGLYPHIC
PICTURE SEVERAL UNREADABLE SCRAWLS ON PAPER CYRIL OVERTON WAS MUCH
EXCITED HOLD IT TO THE GLASS HE CRIED
THAT IS UNNECESSARY SAID HOLMES THE PAPER IS THIN AND THE
REVERSE WILL GIVE THE MESSAGE HERE IT IS HE TURNED IT OVER AND WE
READ
PICTURE STAND BY US FOR GODS SAKE SO THAT IS THE TAIL END OF THE
TELEGRAM WHICH GODFREY STAUNTON
DISPATCHED WITHIN A FEW HOURS OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE THERE ARE AT
LEAST SIX WORDS OF THE MESSAGE WHICH HAVE ESCAPED US BUT WHAT
REMAINSSTAND BY US FOR GODS SAKEPROVES THAT THIS YOUNG MAN
SAW A FORMIDABLE DANGER WHICH APPROACHED HIM AND FROM WHICH SOMEONE
ELSE COULD PROTECT HIM US MARK YOU ANOTHER PERSON WAS INVOLVED
WHO SHOULD IT BE BUT THE PALEFACED BEARDED MAN WHO SEEMED HIMSELF
IN SO NERVOUS A STATE WHAT THEN IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN GODFREY
STAUNTON AND THE BEARDED MAN AND WHAT IS THE THIRD SOURCE FROM WHICH
EACH OF THEM SOUGHT FOR HELP AGAINST PRESSING DANGER OUR INQUIRY HAS
ALREADY NARROWED DOWN TO THAT
WE HAVE ONLY TO FIND TO WHOM THAT TELEGRAM IS ADDRESSED I
SUGGESTED
EXACTLY MY DEAR WATSON YOUR REFLECTION THOUGH PROFOUND HAD
ALREADY CROSSED MY MIND BUT I DARE SAY IT MAY HAVE COME TO YOUR
NOTICE THAT IF YOU WALK INTO A POSTOFFICE AND DEMAND TO SEE THE
COUNTERFOIL OF ANOTHER MANS MESSAGE THERE MAY BE SOME DISINCLINATION
ON THE PART OF THE OFFICIALS TO OBLIGE YOU THERE IS SO MUCH RED TAPE
IN THESE MATTERS HOWEVER I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WITH A LITTLE
DELICACY AND FINESSE THE END MAY BE ATTAINED MEANWHILE I SHOULD
LIKE IN YOUR PRESENCE MR OVERTON TO GO THROUGH THESE PAPERS WHICH
HAVE BEEN LEFT UPON THE TABLE
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF LETTERS BILLS AND NOTEBOOKS WHICH HOLMES
TURNED OVER AND EXAMINED WITH QUICK NERVOUS FINGERS AND DARTING
PENETRATING EYES NOTHING HERE HE SAID AT LAST BY THE WAY I
SUPPOSE YOUR FRIEND WAS A HEALTHY YOUNG FELLOWNOTHING AMISS WITH
HIM
SOUND AS A BELL
HAVE YOU EVER KNOWN HIM ILL
NOT A DAY HE HAS BEEN LAID UP WITH A HACK AND ONCE HE SLIPPED HIS
KNEECAP BUT THAT WAS NOTHING
PERHAPS HE WAS NOT SO STRONG AS YOU SUPPOSE I SHOULD THINK HE MAY
HAVE HAD SOME SECRET TROUBLE WITH YOUR ASSENT I WILL PUT ONE OR TWO
OF THESE PAPERS IN MY POCKET IN CASE THEY SHOULD BEAR UPON OUR
FUTURE INQUIRY
ONE MOMENT ONE MOMENT CRIED A QUERULOUS VOICE AND WE LOOKED UP
TO FIND A QUEER LITTLE OLD MAN JERKING AND TWITCHING IN THE DOORWAY
HE WAS DRESSED IN RUSTY BLACK WITH A VERY BROAD BRIMMED TOPHAT AND
A LOOSE WHITE NECKTIETHE WHOLE EFFECT BEING THAT OF A VERY RUSTIC
PARSON OR OF AN UNDERTAKERS MUTE YET IN SPITE OF HIS SHABBY AND
EVEN ABSURD APPEARANCE HIS VOICE HAD A SHARP CRACKLE AND HIS MANNER
A QUICK INTENSITY WHICH COMMANDED ATTENTION
WHO ARE YOU SIR AND BY WHAT RIGHT DO YOU TOUCH THIS GENTLEMANS
PAPERS HE ASKED
I AM A PRIVATE DETECTIVE AND I AM ENDEAVOURING TO EXPLAIN HIS
DISAPPEARANCE
OH YOU ARE ARE YOU AND WHO INSTRUCTED YOU EH
THIS GENTLEMAN MR STAUNTONS FRIEND WAS REFERRED TO ME BY
SCOTLAND YARD
WHO ARE YOU SIR
I AM CYRIL OVERTON
THEN IT IS YOU WHO SENT ME A TELEGRAM MY NAME IS LORD MOUNTJAMES
I CAME ROUND AS QUICKLY AS THE BAYSWATER BUS WOULD BRING ME SO YOU
HAVE INSTRUCTED A DETECTIVE
YES SIR
AND ARE YOU PREPARED TO MEET THE COST
I HAVE NO DOUBT SIR THAT MY FRIEND GODFREY WHEN WE FIND HIM WILL
BE PREPARED TO DO THAT
BUT IF HE IS NEVER FOUND EH ANSWER ME THAT
IN THAT CASE NO DOUBT HIS FAMILY
NOTHING OF THE SORT SIR SCREAMED THE LITTLE MAN DONT LOOK TO
ME FOR A PENNYNOT A PENNY YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MR DETECTIVE I AM
ALL THE FAMILY THAT THIS YOUNG MAN HAS GOT AND I TELL YOU THAT I AM
NOT RESPONSIBLE IF HE HAS ANY EXPECTATIONS IT IS DUE TO THE FACT
THAT I HAVE NEVER WASTED MONEY AND I DO NOT PROPOSE TO BEGIN TO DO
SO NOW AS TO THOSE PAPERS WITH WHICH YOU ARE MAKING SO FREE I MAY
TELL YOU THAT IN CASE THERE SHOULD BE ANYTHING OF ANY VALUE AMONG
THEM YOU WILL BE HELD STRICTLY TO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THEM
VERY GOOD SIR SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES MAY I ASK IN THE MEANWHILE
WHETHER YOU HAVE YOURSELF ANY THEORY TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS YOUNG MANS
DISAPPEARANCE
NO SIR I HAVE NOT HE IS BIG ENOUGH AND OLD ENOUGH TO LOOK AFTER
HIMSELF AND IF HE IS SO FOOLISH AS TO LOSE HIMSELF I ENTIRELY REFUSE
TO ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HUNTING FOR HIM
I QUITE UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION SAID HOLMES WITH A MISCHIEVOUS
TWINKLE IN HIS EYES PERHAPS YOU DONT QUITE UNDERSTAND MINE
GODFREY STAUNTON APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A POOR MAN IF HE HAS BEEN
KIDNAPPED IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOR ANYTHING WHICH HE HIMSELF
POSSESSES THE FAME OF YOUR WEALTH HAS GONE ABROAD LORD MOUNTJAMES
AND IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT A GANG OF THIEVES HAVE SECURED YOUR
NEPHEW IN ORDER TO GAIN FROM HIM SOME INFORMATION AS TO YOUR HOUSE
YOUR HABITS AND YOUR TREASURE
THE FACE OF OUR UNPLEASANT LITTLE VISITOR TURNED AS WHITE AS HIS
NECKCLOTH
HEAVENS SIR WHAT AN IDEA I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH VILLAINY WHAT
INHUMAN ROGUES THERE ARE IN THE WORLD BUT GODFREY IS A FINE LADA
STAUNCH LAD NOTHING WOULD INDUCE HIM TO GIVE HIS OLD UNCLE AWAY
ILL HAVE THE PLATE MOVED OVER TO THE BANK THIS EVENING IN THE
MEANTIME SPARE NO PAINS MR DETECTIVE I BEG YOU TO LEAVE NO STONE
UNTURNED TO BRING HIM SAFELY BACK AS TO MONEY WELL SO FAR AS A
FIVER OR EVEN A TENNER GOES YOU CAN ALWAYS LOOK TO ME
EVEN IN HIS CHASTENED FRAME OF MIND THE NOBLE MISER COULD GIVE US NO
INFORMATION WHICH COULD HELP US FOR HE KNEW LITTLE OF THE PRIVATE
LIFE OF HIS NEPHEW OUR ONLY CLUE LAY IN THE TRUNCATED TELEGRAM AND
WITH A COPY OF THIS IN HIS HAND HOLMES SET FORTH TO FIND A SECOND
LINK FOR HIS CHAIN WE HAD SHAKEN OFF LORD MOUNTJAMES AND OVERTON
HAD GONE TO CONSULT WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS TEAM OVER THE
MISFORTUNE WHICH HAD BEFALLEN THEM
THERE WAS A TELEGRAPHOFFICE AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE HOTEL WE
HALTED OUTSIDE IT
ITS WORTH TRYING WATSON SAID HOLMES OF COURSE WITH A WARRANT
WE COULD DEMAND TO SEE THE COUNTERFOILS BUT WE HAVE NOT REACHED THAT
STAGE YET I DONT SUPPOSE THEY REMEMBER FACES IN SO BUSY A PLACE
LET US VENTURE IT
I AM SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU SAID HE IN HIS BLANDEST MANNER TO THE
YOUNG WOMAN BEHIND THE GRATING THERE IS SOME SMALL MISTAKE ABOUT A
TELEGRAM I SENT YESTERDAY I HAVE HAD NO ANSWER AND I VERY MUCH FEAR
THAT I MUST HAVE OMITTED TO PUT MY NAME AT THE END COULD YOU TELL ME
IF THIS WAS SO
THE YOUNG WOMAN TURNED OVER A SHEAF OF COUNTERFOILS
WHAT OCLOCK WAS IT SHE ASKED
A LITTLE AFTER SIX
WHOM WAS IT TO
HOLMES PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS AND GLANCED AT ME THE LAST WORDS
IN IT WERE FOR GODS SAKE HE WHISPERED CONFIDENTIALLY I AM
VERY ANXIOUS AT GETTING NO ANSWER
THE YOUNG WOMAN SEPARATED ONE OF THE FORMS
THIS IS IT THERE IS NO NAME SAID SHE SMOOTHING IT OUT UPON THE
COUNTER
THEN THAT OF COURSE ACCOUNTS FOR MY GETTING NO ANSWER SAID
HOLMES DEAR ME HOW VERY STUPID OF ME TO BE SURE GOOD MORNING
MISS AND MANY THANKS FOR HAVING RELIEVED MY MIND HE CHUCKLED AND
RUBBED HIS HANDS WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE STREET ONCE MORE
WELL I ASKED
WE PROGRESS MY DEAR WATSON WE PROGRESS I HAD SEVEN DIFFERENT
SCHEMES FOR GETTING A GLIMPSE OF THAT TELEGRAM BUT I COULD HARDLY
HOPE TO SUCCEED THE VERY FIRST TIME
AND WHAT HAVE YOU GAINED
A STARTINGPOINT FOR OUR INVESTIGATION HE HAILED A CAB KINGS
CROSS STATION SAID HE
WE HAVE A JOURNEY THEN
YES I THINK WE MUST RUN DOWN TO CAMBRIDGE TOGETHER ALL THE
INDICATIONS SEEM TO ME TO POINT IN THAT DIRECTION
TELL ME I ASKED AS WE RATTLED UP GRAYS INN ROAD HAVE YOU ANY
SUSPICION YET AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE DISAPPEARANCE I DONT THINK
THAT AMONG ALL OUR CASES I HAVE KNOWN ONE WHERE THE MOTIVES ARE MORE
OBSCURE SURELY YOU DONT REALLY IMAGINE THAT HE MAY BE KIDNAPPED IN
ORDER TO GIVE INFORMATION AGAINST HIS WEALTHY UNCLE
I CONFESS MY DEAR WATSON THAT THAT DOES NOT APPEAL TO ME AS A VERY
PROBABLE EXPLANATION IT STRUCK ME HOWEVER AS BEING THE ONE WHICH
WAS MOST LIKELY TO INTEREST THAT EXCEEDINGLY UNPLEASANT OLD PERSON
IT CERTAINLY DID THAT BUT WHAT ARE YOUR ALTERNATIVES
I COULD MENTION SEVERAL YOU MUST ADMIT THAT IT IS CURIOUS AND
SUGGESTIVE THAT THIS INCIDENT SHOULD OCCUR ON THE EVE OF THIS
IMPORTANT MATCH AND SHOULD INVOLVE THE ONLY MAN WHOSE PRESENCE SEEMS
ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE SIDE IT MAY OF COURSE BE
COINCIDENCE BUT IT IS INTERESTING AMATEUR SPORT IS FREE FROM
BETTING BUT A GOOD DEAL OF OUTSIDE BETTING GOES ON AMONG THE PUBLIC
AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH SOMEONES WHILE TO GET AT A
PLAYER AS THE RUFFIANS OF THE TURF GET AT A RACEHORSE THERE IS ONE
EXPLANATION A SECOND VERY OBVIOUS ONE IS THAT THIS YOUNG MAN REALLY
IS THE HEIR OF A GREAT PROPERTY HOWEVER MODEST HIS MEANS MAY AT
PRESENT BE AND IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT A PLOT TO HOLD HIM FOR
RANSOM MIGHT BE CONCOCTED
THESE THEORIES TAKE NO ACCOUNT OF THE TELEGRAM
QUITE TRUE WATSON THE TELEGRAM STILL REMAINS THE ONLY SOLID THING
WITH WHICH WE HAVE TO DEAL AND WE MUST NOT PERMIT OUR ATTENTION TO
WANDER AWAY FROM IT IT IS TO GAIN LIGHT UPON THE PURPOSE OF THIS
TELEGRAM THAT WE ARE NOW UPON OUR WAY TO CAMBRIDGE THE PATH OF OUR
INVESTIGATION IS AT PRESENT OBSCURE BUT I SHALL BE VERY MUCH
SURPRISED IF BEFORE EVENING WE HAVE NOT CLEARED IT UP OR MADE A
CONSIDERABLE ADVANCE ALONG IT
IT WAS ALREADY DARK WHEN WE REACHED THE OLD UNIVERSITY CITY HOLMES
TOOK A CAB AT THE STATION AND ORDERED THE MAN TO DRIVE TO THE HOUSE
OF DR LESLIE ARMSTRONG A FEW MINUTES LATER WE HAD STOPPED AT A
LARGE MANSION IN THE BUSIEST THOROUGHFARE WE WERE SHOWN IN AND
AFTER A LONG WAIT WERE AT LAST ADMITTED INTO THE CONSULTINGROOM
WHERE WE FOUND THE DOCTOR SEATED BEHIND HIS TABLE
IT ARGUES THE DEGREE IN WHICH I HAD LOST TOUCH WITH MY PROFESSION
THAT THE NAME OF LESLIE ARMSTRONG WAS UNKNOWN TO ME NOW I AM AWARE
THAT HE IS NOT ONLY ONE OF THE HEADS OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOL OF THE
UNIVERSITY BUT A THINKER OF EUROPEAN REPUTATION IN MORE THAN ONE
BRANCH OF SCIENCE YET EVEN WITHOUT KNOWING HIS BRILLIANT RECORD ONE
COULD NOT FAIL TO BE IMPRESSED BY A MERE GLANCE AT THE MAN THE
SQUARE MASSIVE FACE THE BROODING EYES UNDER THE THATCHED BROWS AND
THE GRANITE MOULDING OF THE INFLEXIBLE JAW A MAN OF DEEP CHARACTER
A MAN WITH AN ALERT MIND GRIM ASCETIC SELFCONTAINED
FORMIDABLESO I READ DR LESLIE ARMSTRONG HE HELD MY FRIENDS CARD
IN HIS HAND AND HE LOOKED UP WITH NO VERY PLEASED EXPRESSION UPON
HIS DOUR FEATURES
I HAVE HEARD YOUR NAME MR SHERLOCK HOLMES AND I AM AWARE OF YOUR
PROFESSION ONE OF WHICH I BY NO MEANS APPROVE
IN THAT DOCTOR YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF IN AGREEMENT WITH EVERY
CRIMINAL IN THE COUNTRY SAID MY FRIEND QUIETLY
SO FAR AS YOUR EFFORTS ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE SUPPRESSION OF
CRIME SIR THEY MUST HAVE THE SUPPORT OF EVERY REASONABLE MEMBER OF
THE COMMUNITY THOUGH I CANNOT DOUBT THAT THE OFFICIAL MACHINERY IS
AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE WHERE YOUR CALLING IS MORE OPEN TO
CRITICISM IS WHEN YOU PRY INTO THE SECRETS OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS
WHEN YOU RAKE UP FAMILY MATTERS WHICH ARE BETTER HIDDEN AND WHEN YOU
INCIDENTALLY WASTE THE TIME OF MEN WHO ARE MORE BUSY THAN YOURSELF
AT THE PRESENT MOMENT FOR EXAMPLE I SHOULD BE WRITING A TREATISE
INSTEAD OF CONVERSING WITH YOU
NO DOUBT DOCTOR AND YET THE CONVERSATION MAY PROVE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE TREATISE INCIDENTALLY I MAY TELL YOU THAT WE ARE DOING THE
REVERSE OF WHAT YOU VERY JUSTLY BLAME AND THAT WE ARE ENDEAVOURING
TO PREVENT ANYTHING LIKE PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF PRIVATE MATTERS WHICH
MUST NECESSARILY FOLLOW WHEN ONCE THE CASE IS FAIRLY IN THE HANDS OF
THE OFFICIAL POLICE YOU MAY LOOK UPON ME SIMPLY AS AN IRREGULAR
PIONEER WHO GOES IN FRONT OF THE REGULAR FORCES OF THE COUNTRY I
HAVE COME TO ASK YOU ABOUT MR GODFREY STAUNTON
WHAT ABOUT HIM
YOU KNOW HIM DO YOU NOT
HE IS AN INTIMATE FRIEND OF MINE
YOU ARE AWARE THAT HE HAS DISAPPEARED
AH INDEED THERE WAS NO CHANGE OF EXPRESSION IN THE RUGGED
FEATURES OF THE DOCTOR
HE LEFT HIS HOTEL LAST NIGHT HE HAS NOT BEEN HEARD OF
NO DOUBT HE WILL RETURN
TOMORROW IS THE VARSITY FOOTBALL MATCH
I HAVE NO SYMPATHY WITH THESE CHILDISH GAMES THE YOUNG MANS FATE
INTERESTS ME DEEPLY SINCE I KNOW HIM AND LIKE HIM THE FOOTBALL
MATCH DOES NOT COME WITHIN MY HORIZON AT ALL
I CLAIM YOUR SYMPATHY THEN IN MY INVESTIGATION OF MR STAUNTONS
FATE DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS
CERTAINLY NOT
YOU HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE YESTERDAY
NO I HAVE NOT
WAS MR STAUNTON A HEALTHY MAN
ABSOLUTELY
DID YOU EVER KNOW HIM ILL
NEVER
HOLMES POPPED A SHEET OF PAPER BEFORE THE DOCTORS EYES THEN
PERHAPS YOU WILL EXPLAIN THIS RECEIPTED BILL FOR THIRTEEN GUINEAS
PAID BY MR GODFREY STAUNTON LAST MONTH TO DR LESLIE ARMSTRONG OF
CAMBRIDGE I PICKED IT OUT FROM AMONG THE PAPERS UPON HIS DESK
THE DOCTOR FLUSHED WITH ANGER
I DO NOT FEEL THAT THERE IS ANY REASON WHY I SHOULD RENDER AN
EXPLANATION TO YOU MR HOLMES
HOLMES REPLACED THE BILL IN HIS NOTEBOOK IF YOU PREFER A PUBLIC
EXPLANATION IT MUST COME SOONER OR LATER SAID HE I HAVE ALREADY
TOLD YOU THAT I CAN HUSH UP THAT WHICH OTHERS WILL BE BOUND TO
PUBLISH AND YOU WOULD REALLY BE WISER TO TAKE ME INTO YOUR COMPLETE
CONFIDENCE
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
DID YOU HEAR FROM MR STAUNTON IN LONDON
CERTAINLY NOT
DEAR ME DEAR ME THE POSTOFFICE AGAIN HOLMES SIGHED WEARILY A
MOST URGENT TELEGRAM WAS DISPATCHED TO YOU FROM LONDON BY GODFREY
STAUNTON AT SIXFIFTEEN YESTERDAY EVENINGA TELEGRAM WHICH IS
UNDOUBTEDLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIS DISAPPEARANCEAND YET YOU HAVE NOT
HAD IT IT IS MOST CULPABLE I SHALL CERTAINLY GO DOWN TO THE OFFICE
HERE AND REGISTER A COMPLAINT
DR LESLIE ARMSTRONG SPRANG UP FROM BEHIND HIS DESK AND HIS DARK
FACE WAS CRIMSON WITH FURY
ILL TROUBLE YOU TO WALK OUT OF MY HOUSE SIR SAID HE YOU CAN
TELL YOUR EMPLOYER LORD MOUNTJAMES THAT I DO NOT WISH TO HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO EITHER WITH HIM OR WITH HIS AGENTS NO SIR NOT
ANOTHER WORD HE RANG THE BELL FURIOUSLY JOHN SHOW THESE
GENTLEMEN OUT A POMPOUS BUTLER USHERED US SEVERELY TO THE DOOR AND
WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE STREET HOLMES BURST OUT LAUGHING
DR LESLIE ARMSTRONG IS CERTAINLY A MAN OF ENERGY AND CHARACTER
SAID HE I HAVE NOT SEEN A MAN WHO IF HE TURNED HIS TALENTS THAT
WAY WAS MORE CALCULATED TO FILL THE GAP LEFT BY THE ILLUSTRIOUS
MORIARTY AND NOW MY POOR WATSON HERE WE ARE STRANDED AND
FRIENDLESS IN THIS INHOSPITABLE TOWN WHICH WE CANNOT LEAVE WITHOUT
ABANDONING OUR CASE THIS LITTLE INN JUST OPPOSITE ARMSTRONGS HOUSE
IS SINGULARLY ADAPTED TO OUR NEEDS IF YOU WOULD ENGAGE A FRONT ROOM
AND PURCHASE THE NECESSARIES FOR THE NIGHT I MAY HAVE TIME TO MAKE A
FEW INQUIRIES
THESE FEW INQUIRIES PROVED HOWEVER TO BE A MORE LENGTHY PROCEEDING
THAN HOLMES HAD IMAGINED FOR HE DID NOT RETURN TO THE INN UNTIL
NEARLY NINE OCLOCK HE WAS PALE AND DEJECTED STAINED WITH DUST AND
EXHAUSTED WITH HUNGER AND FATIGUE A COLD SUPPER WAS READY UPON THE
TABLE AND WHEN HIS NEEDS WERE SATISFIED AND HIS PIPE ALIGHT HE WAS
READY TO TAKE THAT HALF COMIC AND WHOLLY PHILOSOPHIC VIEW WHICH WAS
NATURAL TO HIM WHEN HIS AFFAIRS WERE GOING AWRY THE SOUND OF
CARRIAGE WHEELS CAUSED HIM TO RISE AND GLANCE OUT OF THE WINDOW A
BROUGHAM AND PAIR OF GREYS UNDER THE GLARE OF A GASLAMP STOOD BEFORE
THE DOCTORS DOOR
ITS BEEN OUT THREE HOURS SAID HOLMES STARTED AT HALFPAST SIX
AND HERE IT IS BACK AGAIN THAT GIVES A RADIUS OF TEN OR TWELVE
MILES AND HE DOES IT ONCE OR SOMETIMES TWICE A DAY
NO UNUSUAL THING FOR A DOCTOR IN PRACTICE
BUT ARMSTRONG IS NOT REALLY A DOCTOR IN PRACTICE HE IS A LECTURER
AND A CONSULTANT BUT HE DOES NOT CARE FOR GENERAL PRACTICE WHICH
DISTRACTS HIM FROM HIS LITERARY WORK WHY THEN DOES HE MAKE THESE
LONG JOURNEYS WHICH MUST BE EXCEEDINGLY IRKSOME TO HIM AND WHO IS
IT THAT HE VISITS
HIS COACHMAN
MY DEAR WATSON CAN YOU DOUBT THAT IT WAS TO HIM THAT I FIRST
APPLIED I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT CAME FROM HIS OWN INNATE DEPRAVITY
OR FROM THE PROMPTINGS OF HIS MASTER BUT HE WAS RUDE ENOUGH TO SET A
DOG AT ME NEITHER DOG NOR MAN LIKED THE LOOK OF MY STICK HOWEVER
AND THE MATTER FELL THROUGH RELATIONS WERE STRAINED AFTER THAT AND
FURTHER INQUIRIES OUT OF THE QUESTION ALL THAT I HAVE LEARNED I GOT
FROM A FRIENDLY NATIVE IN THE YARD OF OUR OWN INN IT WAS HE WHO TOLD
ME OF THE DOCTORS HABITS AND OF HIS DAILY JOURNEY AT THAT INSTANT
TO GIVE POINT TO HIS WORDS THE CARRIAGE CAME ROUND TO THE DOOR
COULD YOU NOT FOLLOW IT
EXCELLENT WATSON YOU ARE SCINTILLATING THIS EVENING THE IDEA DID
CROSS MY MIND THERE IS AS YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED A BICYCLE SHOP
NEXT TO OUR INN INTO THIS I RUSHED ENGAGED A BICYCLE AND WAS ABLE
TO GET STARTED BEFORE THE CARRIAGE WAS QUITE OUT OF SIGHT I RAPIDLY
OVERTOOK IT AND THEN KEEPING AT A DISCREET DISTANCE OF A HUNDRED
YARDS OR SO I FOLLOWED ITS LIGHTS UNTIL WE WERE CLEAR OF THE TOWN
WE HAD GOT WELL OUT ON THE COUNTRY ROAD WHEN A SOMEWHAT MORTIFYING
INCIDENT OCCURRED THE CARRIAGE STOPPED THE DOCTOR ALIGHTED WALKED
SWIFTLY BACK TO WHERE I HAD ALSO HALTED AND TOLD ME IN AN EXCELLENT
SARDONIC FASHION THAT HE FEARED THE ROAD WAS NARROW AND THAT HE
HOPED HIS CARRIAGE DID NOT IMPEDE THE PASSAGE OF MY BICYCLE NOTHING
COULD HAVE BEEN MORE ADMIRABLE THAN HIS WAY OF PUTTING IT I AT ONCE
RODE PAST THE CARRIAGE AND KEEPING TO THE MAIN ROAD I WENT ON FOR
A FEW MILES AND THEN HALTED IN A CONVENIENT PLACE TO SEE IF THE
CARRIAGE PASSED THERE WAS NO SIGN OF IT HOWEVER AND SO IT BECAME
EVIDENT THAT IT HAD TURNED DOWN ONE OF SEVERAL SIDE ROADS WHICH I HAD
OBSERVED I RODE BACK BUT AGAIN SAW NOTHING OF THE CARRIAGE AND
NOW AS YOU PERCEIVE IT HAS RETURNED AFTER ME OF COURSE I HAD AT
THE OUTSET NO PARTICULAR REASON TO CONNECT THESE JOURNEYS WITH THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF GODFREY STAUNTON AND WAS ONLY INCLINED TO
INVESTIGATE THEM ON THE GENERAL GROUNDS THAT EVERYTHING WHICH
CONCERNS DR ARMSTRONG IS AT PRESENT OF INTEREST TO US BUT NOW THAT
I FIND HE KEEPS SO KEEN A LOOKOUT UPON ANYONE WHO MAY FOLLOW HIM ON
THESE EXCURSIONS THE AFFAIR APPEARS MORE IMPORTANT AND I SHALL NOT
BE SATISFIED UNTIL I HAVE MADE THE MATTER CLEAR
WE CAN FOLLOW HIM TOMORROW
CAN WE IT IS NOT SO EASY AS YOU SEEM TO THINK YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR
WITH CAMBRIDGESHIRE SCENERY ARE YOU IT DOES NOT LEND ITSELF TO
CONCEALMENT ALL THIS COUNTRY THAT I PASSED OVER TONIGHT IS AS FLAT
AND CLEAN AS THE PALM OF YOUR HAND AND THE MAN WE ARE FOLLOWING IS
NO FOOL AS HE VERY CLEARLY SHOWED TONIGHT I HAVE WIRED TO OVERTON
TO LET US KNOW ANY FRESH LONDON DEVELOPMENTS AT THIS ADDRESS AND IN
THE MEANTIME WE CAN ONLY CONCENTRATE OUR ATTENTION UPON DR
ARMSTRONG WHOSE NAME THE OBLIGING YOUNG LADY AT THE OFFICE ALLOWED
ME TO READ UPON THE COUNTERFOIL OF STAUNTONS URGENT MESSAGE HE
KNOWS WHERE THE YOUNG MAN ISTO THAT ILL SWEARAND IF HE KNOWS
THEN IT MUST BE OUR OWN FAULT IF WE CANNOT MANAGE TO KNOW ALSO AT
PRESENT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THE ODD TRICK IS IN HIS POSSESSION
AND AS YOU ARE AWARE WATSON IT IS NOT MY HABIT TO LEAVE THE GAME
IN THAT CONDITION
AND YET THE NEXT DAY BROUGHT US NO NEARER TO THE SOLUTION OF THE
MYSTERY A NOTE WAS HANDED IN AFTER BREAKFAST WHICH HOLMES PASSED
ACROSS TO ME WITH A SMILE
SIR IT RAN
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME IN DOGGING MY
MOVEMENTS I HAVE AS YOU DISCOVERED LAST NIGHT A WINDOW AT THE BACK
OF MY BROUGHAM AND IF YOU DESIRE A TWENTYMILE RIDE WHICH WILL LEAD
YOU TO THE SPOT FROM WHICH YOU STARTED YOU HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW ME
MEANWHILE I CAN INFORM YOU THAT NO SPYING UPON ME CAN IN ANY WAY
HELP MR GODFREY STAUNTON AND I AM CONVINCED THAT THE BEST SERVICE
YOU CAN DO TO THAT GENTLEMAN IS TO RETURN AT ONCE TO LONDON AND TO
REPORT TO YOUR EMPLOYER THAT YOU ARE UNABLE TO TRACE HIM YOUR TIME
IN CAMBRIDGE WILL CERTAINLY BE WASTED
YOURS FAITHFULLY
LESLIE ARMSTRONG
AN OUTSPOKEN HONEST ANTAGONIST IS THE DOCTOR SAID HOLMES WELL
WELL HE EXCITES MY CURIOSITY AND I MUST REALLY KNOW MORE BEFORE I
LEAVE HIM
HIS CARRIAGE IS AT HIS DOOR NOW SAID I THERE HE IS STEPPING INTO
IT I SAW HIM GLANCE UP AT OUR WINDOW AS HE DID SO SUPPOSE I TRY MY
LUCK UPON THE BICYCLE
NO NO MY DEAR WATSON WITH ALL RESPECT FOR YOUR NATURAL ACUMEN I
DO NOT THINK THAT YOU ARE QUITE A MATCH FOR THE WORTHY DOCTOR I
THINK THAT POSSIBLY I CAN ATTAIN OUR END BY SOME INDEPENDENT
EXPLORATIONS OF MY OWN I AM AFRAID THAT I MUST LEAVE YOU TO YOUR OWN
DEVICES AS THE APPEARANCE OF TWO INQUIRING STRANGERS UPON A SLEEPY
COUNTRYSIDE MIGHT EXCITE MORE GOSSIP THAN I CARE FOR NO DOUBT YOU
WILL FIND SOME SIGHTS TO AMUSE YOU IN THIS VENERABLE CITY AND I HOPE
TO BRING BACK A MORE FAVOURABLE REPORT TO YOU BEFORE EVENING
ONCE MORE HOWEVER MY FRIEND WAS DESTINED TO BE DISAPPOINTED HE
CAME BACK AT NIGHT WEARY AND UNSUCCESSFUL
I HAVE HAD A BLANK DAY WATSON HAVING GOT THE DOCTORS GENERAL
DIRECTION I SPENT THE DAY IN VISITING ALL THE VILLAGES UPON THAT
SIDE OF CAMBRIDGE AND COMPARING NOTES WITH PUBLICANS AND OTHER LOCAL
NEWS AGENCIES I HAVE COVERED SOME GROUND CHESTERTON HISTON
WATERBEACH AND OAKINGTON HAVE EACH BEEN EXPLORED AND HAVE EACH
PROVED DISAPPOINTING THE DAILY APPEARANCE OF A BROUGHAM AND PAIR
COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED IN SUCH SLEEPY HOLLOWS THE DOCTOR
HAS SCORED ONCE MORE IS THERE A TELEGRAM FOR ME
YES I OPENED IT HERE IT IS
ASK FOR POMPEY FROM JEREMY DIXON TRINITY COLLEGE
I DONT UNDERSTAND IT
OH IT IS CLEAR ENOUGH IT IS FROM OUR FRIEND OVERTON AND IS IN
ANSWER TO A QUESTION FROM ME ILL JUST SEND ROUND A NOTE TO MR
JEREMY DIXON AND THEN I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT OUR LUCK WILL TURN BY
THE WAY IS THERE ANY NEWS OF THE MATCH
YES THE LOCAL EVENING PAPER HAS AN EXCELLENT ACCOUNT IN ITS LAST
EDITION OXFORD WON BY A GOAL AND TWO TRIES THE LAST SENTENCES OF
THE DESCRIPTION SAY
THE DEFEAT OF THE LIGHT BLUES MAY BE ENTIRELY ATTRIBUTED TO THE
UNFORTUNATE ABSENCE OF THE CRACK INTERNATIONAL GODFREY STAUNTON
WHOSE WANT WAS FELT AT EVERY INSTANT OF THE GAME THE LACK OF
COMBINATION IN THE THREEQUARTER LINE AND THEIR WEAKNESS BOTH IN
ATTACK AND DEFENCE MORE THAN NEUTRALIZED THE EFFORTS OF A HEAVY AND
HARDWORKING PACK
THEN OUR FRIEND OVERTONS FOREBODINGS HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED SAID
HOLMES PERSONALLY I AM IN AGREEMENT WITH DR ARMSTRONG AND
FOOTBALL DOES NOT COME WITHIN MY HORIZON EARLY TO BED TONIGHT
WATSON FOR I FORESEE THAT TOMORROW MAY BE AN EVENTFUL DAY
I WAS HORRIFIED BY MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF HOLMES NEXT MORNING FOR HE
SAT BY THE FIRE HOLDING HIS TINY HYPODERMIC SYRINGE I ASSOCIATED
THAT INSTRUMENT WITH THE SINGLE WEAKNESS OF HIS NATURE AND I FEARED
THE WORST WHEN I SAW IT GLITTERING IN HIS HAND HE LAUGHED AT MY
EXPRESSION OF DISMAY AND LAID IT UPON THE TABLE
NO NO MY DEAR FELLOW THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR ALARM IT IS NOT UPON
THIS OCCASION THE INSTRUMENT OF EVIL BUT IT WILL RATHER PROVE TO BE
THE KEY WHICH WILL UNLOCK OUR MYSTERY ON THIS SYRINGE I BASE ALL MY
HOPES I HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM A SMALL SCOUTING EXPEDITION AND
EVERYTHING IS FAVOURABLE EAT A GOOD BREAKFAST WATSON FOR I PROPOSE
TO GET UPON DR ARMSTRONGS TRAIL TODAY AND ONCE ON IT I WILL NOT
STOP FOR REST OR FOOD UNTIL I RUN HIM TO HIS BURROW
IN THAT CASE SAID I WE HAD BEST CARRY OUR BREAKFAST WITH US FOR
HE IS MAKING AN EARLY START HIS CARRIAGE IS AT THE DOOR
NEVER MIND LET HIM GO HE WILL BE CLEVER IF HE CAN DRIVE WHERE I
CANNOT FOLLOW HIM WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED COME DOWNSTAIRS WITH ME
AND I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO A DETECTIVE WHO IS A VERY EMINENT
SPECIALIST IN THE WORK THAT LIES BEFORE US
WHEN WE DESCENDED I FOLLOWED HOLMES INTO THE STABLE YARD WHERE HE
OPENED THE DOOR OF A LOOSEBOX AND LED OUT A SQUAT LOPEARED
WHITEANDTAN DOG SOMETHING BETWEEN A BEAGLE AND A FOXHOUND
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO POMPEY SAID HE POMPEY IS THE PRIDE OF
THE LOCAL DRAGHOUNDS NO VERY GREAT FLIER AS HIS BUILD WILL SHOW
BUT A STAUNCH HOUND ON A SCENT WELL POMPEY YOU MAY NOT BE FAST
BUT I EXPECT YOU WILL BE TOO FAST FOR A COUPLE OF MIDDLEAGED LONDON
GENTLEMEN SO I WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY OF FASTENING THIS LEATHER LEASH
TO YOUR COLLAR NOW BOY COME ALONG AND SHOW WHAT YOU CAN DO HE
LED HIM ACROSS TO THE DOCTORS DOOR THE DOG SNIFFED ROUND FOR AN
INSTANT AND THEN WITH A SHRILL WHINE OF EXCITEMENT STARTED OFF DOWN
THE STREET TUGGING AT HIS LEASH IN HIS EFFORTS TO GO FASTER IN HALF
AN HOUR WE WERE CLEAR OF THE TOWN AND HASTENING DOWN A COUNTRY ROAD
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE HOLMES I ASKED
A THREADBARE AND VENERABLE DEVICE BUT USEFUL UPON OCCASION I
WALKED INTO THE DOCTORS YARD THIS MORNING AND SHOT MY SYRINGE FULL
OF ANISEED OVER THE HIND WHEEL A DRAGHOUND WILL FOLLOW ANISEED FROM
HERE TO JOHN O GROATS AND OUR FRIEND ARMSTRONG WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE
THROUGH THE CAM BEFORE HE WOULD SHAKE POMPEY OFF HIS TRAIL OH THE
CUNNING RASCAL THIS IS HOW HE GAVE ME THE SLIP THE OTHER NIGHT
THE DOG HAD SUDDENLY TURNED OUT OF THE MAIN ROAD INTO A GRASSGROWN
LANE HALF A MILE FARTHER THIS OPENED INTO ANOTHER BROAD ROAD AND
THE TRAIL TURNED HARD TO THE RIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TOWN
WHICH WE HAD JUST QUITTED THE ROAD TOOK A SWEEP TO THE SOUTH OF THE
TOWN AND CONTINUED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THAT IN WHICH WE
STARTED
THIS DTOUR HAS BEEN ENTIRELY FOR OUR BENEFIT THEN SAID HOLMES
NO WONDER THAT MY INQUIRIES AMONG THOSE VILLAGES LED TO NOTHING THE
DOCTOR HAS CERTAINLY PLAYED THE GAME FOR ALL IT IS WORTH AND ONE
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE REASON FOR SUCH ELABORATE DECEPTION THIS
SHOULD BE THE VILLAGE OF TRUMPINGTON TO THE RIGHT OF US AND BY
JOVE HERE IS THE BROUGHAM COMING ROUND THE CORNER QUICK WATSON
QUICK OR WE ARE DONE
HE SPRANG THROUGH A GATE INTO A FIELD DRAGGING THE RELUCTANT POMPEY
AFTER HIM WE HAD HARDLY GOT UNDER THE SHELTER OF THE HEDGE WHEN THE
CARRIAGE RATTLED PAST I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF DR ARMSTRONG WITHIN
HIS SHOULDERS BOWED HIS HEAD SUNK ON HIS HANDS THE VERY IMAGE OF
DISTRESS I COULD TELL BY MY COMPANIONS GRAVER FACE THAT HE ALSO HAD
SEEN
I FEAR THERE IS SOME DARK ENDING TO OUR QUEST SAID HE IT CANNOT
BE LONG BEFORE WE KNOW IT COME POMPEY AH IT IS THE COTTAGE IN THE
FIELD
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT WE HAD REACHED THE END OF OUR JOURNEY
POMPEY RAN ABOUT AND WHINED EAGERLY OUTSIDE THE GATE WHERE THE MARKS
OF THE BROUGHAMS WHEELS WERE STILL TO BE SEEN A FOOTPATH LED ACROSS
TO THE LONELY COTTAGE HOLMES TIED THE DOG TO THE HEDGE AND WE
HASTENED ONWARDS MY FRIEND KNOCKED AT THE LITTLE RUSTIC DOOR AND
KNOCKED AGAIN WITHOUT RESPONSE AND YET THE COTTAGE WAS NOT DESERTED
FOR A LOW SOUND CAME TO OUR EARSA KIND OF DRONE OF MISERY AND
DESPAIR WHICH WAS INDESCRIBABLY MELANCHOLY HOLMES PAUSED
IRRESOLUTE AND THEN HE GLANCED BACK AT THE ROAD WHICH WE HAD JUST
TRAVERSED A BROUGHAM WAS COMING DOWN IT AND THERE COULD BE NO
MISTAKING THOSE GREY HORSES
BY JOVE THE DOCTOR IS COMING BACK CRIED HOLMES THAT SETTLES IT
WE ARE BOUND TO SEE WHAT IT MEANS BEFORE HE COMES
HE OPENED THE DOOR AND WE STEPPED INTO THE HALL THE DRONING SOUND
SWELLED LOUDER UPON OUR EARS UNTIL IT BECAME ONE LONG DEEP WAIL OF
DISTRESS IT CAME FROM UPSTAIRS HOLMES DARTED UP AND I FOLLOWED HIM
HE PUSHED OPEN A HALFCLOSED DOOR AND WE BOTH STOOD APPALLED AT THE
SIGHT BEFORE US
A WOMAN YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL WAS LYING DEAD UPON THE BED HER CALM
PALE FACE WITH DIM WIDEOPENED BLUE EYES LOOKED UPWARD FROM AMID A
GREAT TANGLE OF GOLDEN HAIR AT THE FOOT OF THE BED HALF SITTING
HALF KNEELING HIS FACE BURIED IN THE CLOTHES WAS A YOUNG MAN WHOSE
FRAME WAS RACKED BY HIS SOBS SO ABSORBED WAS HE BY HIS BITTER GRIEF
THAT HE NEVER LOOKED UP UNTIL HOLMESS HAND WAS ON HIS SHOULDER
ARE YOU MR GODFREY STAUNTON
YES YES I AMBUT YOU ARE TOO LATE SHE IS DEAD
THE MAN WAS SO DAZED THAT HE COULD NOT BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE
WERE ANYTHING BUT DOCTORS WHO HAD BEEN SENT TO HIS ASSISTANCE HOLMES
WAS ENDEAVOURING TO UTTER A FEW WORDS OF CONSOLATION AND TO EXPLAIN
THE ALARM WHICH HAD BEEN CAUSED TO HIS FRIENDS BY HIS SUDDEN
DISAPPEARANCE WHEN THERE WAS A STEP UPON THE STAIRS AND THERE WAS
THE HEAVY STERN QUESTIONING FACE OF DR ARMSTRONG AT THE DOOR
SO GENTLEMEN SAID HE YOU HAVE ATTAINED YOUR END AND HAVE
CERTAINLY CHOSEN A PARTICULARLY DELICATE MOMENT FOR YOUR INTRUSION I
WOULD NOT BRAWL IN THE PRESENCE OF DEATH BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT
IF I WERE A YOUNGER MAN YOUR MONSTROUS CONDUCT WOULD NOT PASS WITH
IMPUNITY
EXCUSE ME DR ARMSTRONG I THINK WE ARE A LITTLE AT
CROSSPURPOSES SAID MY FRIEND WITH DIGNITY IF YOU COULD STEP
DOWNSTAIRS WITH US WE MAY EACH BE ABLE TO GIVE SOME LIGHT TO THE
OTHER UPON THIS MISERABLE AFFAIR
A MINUTE LATER THE GRIM DOCTOR AND OURSELVES WERE IN THE SITTINGROOM
BELOW
WELL SIR SAID HE
I WISH YOU TO UNDERSTAND IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT I AM NOT EMPLOYED
BY LORD MOUNTJAMES AND THAT MY SYMPATHIES IN THIS MATTER ARE
ENTIRELY AGAINST THAT NOBLEMAN WHEN A MAN IS LOST IT IS MY DUTY TO
ASCERTAIN HIS FATE BUT HAVING DONE SO THE MATTER ENDS SO FAR AS I AM
CONCERNED AND SO LONG AS THERE IS NOTHING CRIMINAL I AM MUCH MORE
ANXIOUS TO HUSH UP PRIVATE SCANDALS THAN TO GIVE THEM PUBLICITY IF
AS I IMAGINE THERE IS NO BREACH OF THE LAW IN THIS MATTER YOU CAN
ABSOLUTELY DEPEND UPON MY DISCRETION AND MY COOPERATION IN KEEPING
THE FACTS OUT OF THE PAPERS
DR ARMSTRONG TOOK A QUICK STEP FORWARD AND WRUNG HOLMES BY THE HAND
YOU ARE A GOOD FELLOW SAID HE I HAD MISJUDGED YOU I THANK
HEAVEN THAT MY COMPUNCTION AT LEAVING POOR STAUNTON ALL ALONE IN THIS
PLIGHT CAUSED ME TO TURN MY CARRIAGE BACK AND SO TO MAKE YOUR
ACQUAINTANCE KNOWING AS MUCH AS YOU DO THE SITUATION IS VERY EASILY
EXPLAINED A YEAR AGO GODFREY STAUNTON LODGED IN LONDON FOR A TIME
AND BECAME PASSIONATELY ATTACHED TO HIS LANDLADYS DAUGHTER WHOM HE
MARRIED SHE WAS AS GOOD AS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL AND AS INTELLIGENT AS
SHE WAS GOOD NO MAN NEED BE ASHAMED OF SUCH A WIFE BUT GODFREY WAS
THE HEIR TO THIS CRABBED OLD NOBLEMAN AND IT WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT
THE NEWS OF HIS MARRIAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF HIS INHERITANCE
I KNEW THE LAD WELL AND I LOVED HIM FOR HIS MANY EXCELLENT
QUALITIES I DID ALL I COULD TO HELP HIM TO KEEP THINGS STRAIGHT WE
DID OUR VERY BEST TO KEEP THE THING FROM EVERYONE FOR WHEN ONCE SUCH
A WHISPER GETS ABOUT IT IS NOT LONG BEFORE EVERYONE HAS HEARD IT
THANKS TO THIS LONELY COTTAGE AND HIS OWN DISCRETION GODFREY HAS UP
TO NOW SUCCEEDED THEIR SECRET WAS KNOWN TO NO ONE SAVE TO ME AND TO
ONE EXCELLENT SERVANT WHO HAS AT PRESENT GONE FOR ASSISTANCE TO
TRUMPINGTON BUT AT LAST THERE CAME A TERRIBLE BLOW IN THE SHAPE OF
DANGEROUS ILLNESS TO HIS WIFE IT WAS CONSUMPTION OF THE MOST
VIRULENT KIND THE POOR BOY WAS HALF CRAZED WITH GRIEF AND YET HE
HAD TO GO TO LONDON TO PLAY THIS MATCH FOR HE COULD NOT GET OUT OF
IT WITHOUT EXPLANATIONS WHICH WOULD EXPOSE HIS SECRET I TRIED TO
CHEER HIM UP BY A WIRE AND HE SENT ME ONE IN REPLY IMPLORING ME TO
DO ALL I COULD THIS WAS THE TELEGRAM WHICH YOU APPEAR IN SOME
INEXPLICABLE WAY TO HAVE SEEN I DID NOT TELL HIM HOW URGENT THE
DANGER WAS FOR I KNEW THAT HE COULD DO NO GOOD HERE BUT I SENT THE
TRUTH TO THE GIRLS FATHER AND HE VERY INJUDICIOUSLY COMMUNICATED IT
TO GODFREY THE RESULT WAS THAT HE CAME STRAIGHT AWAY IN A STATE
BORDERING ON FRENZY AND HAS REMAINED IN THE SAME STATE KNEELING AT
THE END OF HER BED UNTIL THIS MORNING DEATH PUT AN END TO HER
SUFFERINGS THAT IS ALL MR HOLMES AND I AM SURE THAT I CAN RELY
UPON YOUR DISCRETION AND THAT OF YOUR FRIEND
HOLMES GRASPED THE DOCTORS HAND
COME WATSON SAID HE AND WE PASSED FROM THAT HOUSE OF GRIEF INTO
THE PALE SUNLIGHT OF THE WINTER DAY
THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE
IT WAS ON A BITTERLY COLD AND FROSTY MORNING DURING THE WINTER OF THAT
I WAS AWAKENED BY A TUGGING AT MY SHOULDER IT WAS HOLMES THE
CANDLE IN HIS HAND SHONE UPON HIS EAGER STOOPING FACE AND TOLD ME AT
A GLANCE THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS
COME WATSON COME HE CRIED THE GAME IS AFOOT NOT A WORD INTO
YOUR CLOTHES AND COME
TEN MINUTES LATER WE WERE BOTH IN A CAB AND RATTLING THROUGH THE
SILENT STREETS ON OUR WAY TO CHARING CROSS STATION THE FIRST FAINT
WINTERS DAWN WAS BEGINNING TO APPEAR AND WE COULD DIMLY SEE THE
OCCASIONAL FIGURE OF AN EARLY WORKMAN AS HE PASSED US BLURRED AND
INDISTINCT IN THE OPALESCENT LONDON REEK HOLMES NESTLED IN SILENCE
INTO HIS HEAVY COAT AND I WAS GLAD TO DO THE SAME FOR THE AIR WAS
MOST BITTER AND NEITHER OF US HAD BROKEN OUR FAST IT WAS NOT UNTIL
WE HAD CONSUMED SOME HOT TEA AT THE STATION AND TAKEN OUR PLACES IN
THE KENTISH TRAIN THAT WE WERE SUFFICIENTLY THAWED HE TO SPEAK AND
I TO LISTEN HOLMES DREW A NOTE FROM HIS POCKET AND READ IT ALOUD
ABBEY GRANGE MARSHAM KENT
AM
MY DEAR MR HOLMES
I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD OF YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE IN WHAT PROMISES
TO BE A MOST REMARKABLE CASE IT IS SOMETHING QUITE IN YOUR LINE
EXCEPT FOR RELEASING THE LADY I WILL SEE THAT EVERYTHING IS KEPT
EXACTLY AS I HAVE FOUND IT BUT I BEG YOU NOT TO LOSE AN INSTANT AS
IT IS DIFFICULT TO LEAVE SIR EUSTACE THERE
YOURS FAITHFULLY
STANLEY HOPKINS
HOPKINS HAS CALLED ME IN SEVEN TIMES AND ON EACH OCCASION HIS
SUMMONS HAS BEEN ENTIRELY JUSTIFIED SAID HOLMES I FANCY THAT
EVERY ONE OF HIS CASES HAS FOUND ITS WAY INTO YOUR COLLECTION AND I
MUST ADMIT WATSON THAT YOU HAVE SOME POWER OF SELECTION WHICH
ATONES FOR MUCH WHICH I DEPLORE IN YOUR NARRATIVES YOUR FATAL HABIT
OF LOOKING AT EVERYTHING FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A STORY INSTEAD OF
AS A SCIENTIFIC EXERCISE HAS RUINED WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN
INSTRUCTIVE AND EVEN CLASSICAL SERIES OF DEMONSTRATIONS YOU SLUR
OVER WORK OF THE UTMOST FINESSE AND DELICACY IN ORDER TO DWELL UPON
SENSATIONAL DETAILS WHICH MAY EXCITE BUT CANNOT POSSIBLY INSTRUCT
THE READER
WHY DO YOU NOT WRITE THEM YOURSELF I SAID WITH SOME BITTERNESS
I WILL MY DEAR WATSON I WILL AT PRESENT I AM AS YOU KNOW FAIRLY
BUSY BUT I PROPOSE TO DEVOTE MY DECLINING YEARS TO THE COMPOSITION
OF A TEXTBOOK WHICH SHALL FOCUS THE WHOLE ART OF DETECTION INTO ONE
VOLUME OUR PRESENT RESEARCH APPEARS TO BE A CASE OF MURDER
YOU THINK THIS SIR EUSTACE IS DEAD THEN
I SHOULD SAY SO HOPKINSS WRITING SHOWS CONSIDERABLE AGITATION AND
HE IS NOT AN EMOTIONAL MAN YES I GATHER THERE HAS BEEN VIOLENCE
AND THAT THE BODY IS LEFT FOR OUR INSPECTION A MERE SUICIDE WOULD
NOT HAVE CAUSED HIM TO SEND FOR ME AS TO THE RELEASE OF THE LADY IT
WOULD APPEAR THAT SHE HAS BEEN LOCKED IN HER ROOM DURING THE TRAGEDY
WE ARE MOVING IN HIGH LIFE WATSON CRACKLING PAPER EB MONOGRAM
COATOFARMS PICTURESQUE ADDRESS I THINK THAT FRIEND HOPKINS WILL
LIVE UP TO HIS REPUTATION AND THAT WE SHALL HAVE AN INTERESTING
MORNING THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BEFORE TWELVE LAST NIGHT
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY TELL
BY AN INSPECTION OF THE TRAINS AND BY RECKONING THE TIME THE LOCAL
POLICE HAD TO BE CALLED IN THEY HAD TO COMMUNICATE WITH SCOTLAND
YARD HOPKINS HAD TO GO OUT AND HE IN TURN HAD TO SEND FOR ME ALL
THAT MAKES A FAIR NIGHTS WORK WELL HERE WE ARE AT CHISLEHURST
STATION AND WE SHALL SOON SET OUR DOUBTS AT REST
A DRIVE OF A COUPLE OF MILES THROUGH NARROW COUNTRY LANES BROUGHT US
TO A PARK GATE WHICH WAS OPENED FOR US BY AN OLD LODGEKEEPER WHOSE
HAGGARD FACE BORE THE REFLECTION OF SOME GREAT DISASTER THE AVENUE
RAN THROUGH A NOBLE PARK BETWEEN LINES OF ANCIENT ELMS AND ENDED IN
A LOW WIDESPREAD HOUSE PILLARED IN FRONT AFTER THE FASHION OF
PALLADIO THE CENTRAL PART WAS EVIDENTLY OF A GREAT AGE AND SHROUDED
IN IVY BUT THE LARGE WINDOWS SHOWED THAT MODERN CHANGES HAD BEEN
CARRIED OUT AND ONE WING OF THE HOUSE APPEARED TO BE ENTIRELY NEW
THE YOUTHFUL FIGURE AND ALERT EAGER FACE OF INSPECTOR STANLEY
HOPKINS CONFRONTED US IN THE OPEN DOORWAY
IM VERY GLAD YOU HAVE COME MR HOLMES AND YOU TOO DR WATSON
BUT INDEED IF I HAD MY TIME OVER AGAIN I SHOULD NOT HAVE TROUBLED
YOU FOR SINCE THE LADY HAS COME TO HERSELF SHE HAS GIVEN SO CLEAR AN
ACCOUNT OF THE AFFAIR THAT THERE IS NOT MUCH LEFT FOR US TO DO YOU
REMEMBER THAT LEWISHAM GANG OF BURGLARS
WHAT THE THREE RANDALLS
EXACTLY THE FATHER AND TWO SONS ITS THEIR WORK I HAVE NOT A
DOUBT OF IT THEY DID A JOB AT SYDENHAM A FORTNIGHT AGO AND WERE
SEEN AND DESCRIBED RATHER COOL TO DO ANOTHER SO SOON AND SO NEAR
BUT IT IS THEY BEYOND ALL DOUBT ITS A HANGING MATTER THIS TIME
SIR EUSTACE IS DEAD THEN
YES HIS HEAD WAS KNOCKED IN WITH HIS OWN POKER
SIR EUSTACE BRACKENSTALL THE DRIVER TELLS ME
EXACTLYONE OF THE RICHEST MEN IN KENT LADY BRACKENSTALL IS IN THE
MORNINGROOM POOR LADY SHE HAS HAD A MOST DREADFUL EXPERIENCE SHE
SEEMED HALF DEAD WHEN I SAW HER FIRST I THINK YOU HAD BEST SEE HER
AND HEAR HER ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS THEN WE WILL EXAMINE THE
DININGROOM TOGETHER
LADY BRACKENSTALL WAS NO ORDINARY PERSON SELDOM HAVE I SEEN SO
GRACEFUL A FIGURE SO WOMANLY A PRESENCE AND SO BEAUTIFUL A FACE
SHE WAS A BLONDE GOLDENHAIRED BLUEEYED AND WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE
HAD THE PERFECT COMPLEXION WHICH GOES WITH SUCH COLOURING HAD NOT HER
RECENT EXPERIENCE LEFT HER DRAWN AND HAGGARD HER SUFFERINGS WERE
PHYSICAL AS WELL AS MENTAL FOR OVER ONE EYE ROSE A HIDEOUS
PLUMCOLOURED SWELLING WHICH HER MAID A TALL AUSTERE WOMAN WAS
BATHING ASSIDUOUSLY WITH VINEGAR AND WATER THE LADY LAY BACK
EXHAUSTED UPON A COUCH BUT HER QUICK OBSERVANT GAZE AS WE ENTERED
THE ROOM AND THE ALERT EXPRESSION OF HER BEAUTIFUL FEATURES SHOWED
THAT NEITHER HER WITS NOR HER COURAGE HAD BEEN SHAKEN BY HER TERRIBLE
EXPERIENCE SHE WAS ENVELOPED IN A LOOSE DRESSINGGOWN OF BLUE AND
SILVER BUT A BLACK SEQUINCOVERED DINNERDRESS WAS HUNG UPON THE
COUCH BESIDE HER
I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL THAT HAPPENED MR HOPKINS SHE SAID WEARILY
COULD YOU NOT REPEAT IT FOR ME WELL IF YOU THINK IT NECESSARY I
WILL TELL THESE GENTLEMEN WHAT OCCURRED HAVE THEY BEEN IN THE
DININGROOM YET
I THOUGHT THEY HAD BETTER HEAR YOUR LADYSHIPS STORY FIRST
I SHALL BE GLAD WHEN YOU CAN ARRANGE MATTERS IT IS HORRIBLE TO ME
TO THINK OF HIM STILL LYING THERE SHE SHUDDERED AND BURIED HER FACE
IN HER HANDS AS SHE DID SO THE LOOSE GOWN FELL BACK FROM HER
FOREARMS HOLMES UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION
YOU HAVE OTHER INJURIES MADAM WHAT IS THIS TWO VIVID RED SPOTS
STOOD OUT ON ONE OF THE WHITE ROUND LIMBS SHE HASTILY COVERED IT
IT IS NOTHING IT HAS NO CONNECTION WITH THE HIDEOUS BUSINESS OF
LAST NIGHT IF YOU AND YOUR FRIEND WILL SIT DOWN I WILL TELL YOU ALL
I CAN
I AM THE WIFE OF SIR EUSTACE BRACKENSTALL I HAVE BEEN MARRIED ABOUT
A YEAR I SUPPOSE THAT IT IS NO USE MY ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL THAT OUR
MARRIAGE HAS NOT BEEN A HAPPY ONE I FEAR THAT ALL OUR NEIGHBOURS
WOULD TELL YOU THAT EVEN IF I WERE TO ATTEMPT TO DENY IT PERHAPS
THE FAULT MAY BE PARTLY MINE I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE FREER LESS
CONVENTIONAL ATMOSPHERE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND THIS ENGLISH LIFE
WITH ITS PROPRIETIES AND ITS PRIMNESS IS NOT CONGENIAL TO ME BUT
THE MAIN REASON LIES IN THE ONE FACT WHICH IS NOTORIOUS TO EVERYONE
AND THAT IS THAT SIR EUSTACE WAS A CONFIRMED DRUNKARD TO BE WITH
SUCH A MAN FOR AN HOUR IS UNPLEASANT CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT MEANS
FOR A SENSITIVE AND HIGHSPIRITED WOMAN TO BE TIED TO HIM FOR DAY AND
NIGHT IT IS A SACRILEGE A CRIME A VILLAINY TO HOLD THAT SUCH A
MARRIAGE IS BINDING I SAY THAT THESE MONSTROUS LAWS OF YOURS WILL
BRING A CURSE UPON THE LANDHEAVEN WILL NOT LET SUCH WICKEDNESS
ENDURE FOR AN INSTANT SHE SAT UP HER CHEEKS FLUSHED AND HER EYES
BLAZING FROM UNDER THE TERRIBLE MARK UPON HER BROW THEN THE STRONG
SOOTHING HAND OF THE AUSTERE MAID DREW HER HEAD DOWN ON TO THE
CUSHION AND THE WILD ANGER DIED AWAY INTO PASSIONATE SOBBING AT
LAST SHE CONTINUED
I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT LAST NIGHT YOU ARE AWARE PERHAPS THAT IN
THIS HOUSE ALL SERVANTS SLEEP IN THE MODERN WING THIS CENTRAL BLOCK
IS MADE UP OF THE DWELLINGROOMS WITH THE KITCHEN BEHIND AND OUR
BEDROOM ABOVE MY MAID THERESA SLEEPS ABOVE MY ROOM THERE IS NO ONE
ELSE AND NO SOUND COULD ALARM THOSE WHO ARE IN THE FARTHER WING
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN WELL KNOWN TO THE ROBBERS OR THEY WOULD NOT HAVE
ACTED AS THEY DID
SIR EUSTACE RETIRED ABOUT HALFPAST TEN THE SERVANTS HAD ALREADY
GONE TO THEIR QUARTERS ONLY MY MAID WAS UP AND SHE HAD REMAINED IN
HER ROOM AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE UNTIL I NEEDED HER SERVICES I SAT
UNTIL AFTER ELEVEN IN THIS ROOM ABSORBED IN A BOOK THEN I WALKED
ROUND TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT BEFORE I WENT UPSTAIRS IT WAS MY
CUSTOM TO DO THIS MYSELF FOR AS I HAVE EXPLAINED SIR EUSTACE WAS
NOT ALWAYS TO BE TRUSTED I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN THE BUTLERS
PANTRY THE GUNROOM THE BILLIARDROOM THE DRAWINGROOM AND
FINALLY THE DININGROOM AS I APPROACHED THE WINDOW WHICH IS COVERED
WITH THICK CURTAINS I SUDDENLY FELT THE WIND BLOW UPON MY FACE AND
REALIZED THAT IT WAS OPEN I FLUNG THE CURTAIN ASIDE AND FOUND MYSELF
FACE TO FACE WITH A BROADSHOULDERED ELDERLY MAN WHO HAD JUST
STEPPED INTO THE ROOM THE WINDOW IS A LONG FRENCH ONE WHICH REALLY
FORMS A DOOR LEADING TO THE LAWN I HELD MY BEDROOM CANDLE LIT IN MY
HAND AND BY ITS LIGHT BEHIND THE FIRST MAN I SAW TWO OTHERS WHO
WERE IN THE ACT OF ENTERING I STEPPED BACK BUT THE FELLOW WAS ON ME
IN AN INSTANT HE CAUGHT ME FIRST BY THE WRIST AND THEN BY THE
THROAT I OPENED MY MOUTH TO SCREAM BUT HE STRUCK ME A SAVAGE BLOW
WITH HIS FIST OVER THE EYE AND FELLED ME TO THE GROUND I MUST HAVE
BEEN UNCONSCIOUS FOR A FEW MINUTES FOR WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF I FOUND
THAT THEY HAD TORN DOWN THE BELLROPE AND HAD SECURED ME TIGHTLY TO
THE OAKEN CHAIR WHICH STANDS AT THE HEAD OF THE DININGROOM TABLE I
WAS SO FIRMLY BOUND THAT I COULD NOT MOVE AND A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND
MY MOUTH PREVENTED ME FROM UTTERING ANY SOUND IT WAS AT THIS INSTANT
THAT MY UNFORTUNATE HUSBAND ENTERED THE ROOM HE HAD EVIDENTLY HEARD
SOME SUSPICIOUS SOUNDS AND HE CAME PREPARED FOR SUCH A SCENE AS HE
FOUND HE WAS DRESSED IN HIS SHIRT AND TROUSERS WITH HIS FAVOURITE
BLACKTHORN CUDGEL IN HIS HAND HE RUSHED AT ONE OF THE BURGLARS BUT
ANOTHERIT WAS THE ELDERLY MANSTOOPED PICKED THE POKER OUT OF THE
GRATE AND STRUCK HIM A HORRIBLE BLOW AS HE PASSED HE FELL WITHOUT A
GROAN AND NEVER MOVED AGAIN I FAINTED ONCE MORE BUT AGAIN IT COULD
ONLY HAVE BEEN A VERY FEW MINUTES DURING WHICH I WAS INSENSIBLE WHEN
I OPENED MY EYES I FOUND THAT THEY HAD COLLECTED THE SILVER FROM THE
SIDEBOARD AND THEY HAD DRAWN A BOTTLE OF WINE WHICH STOOD THERE
EACH OF THEM HAD A GLASS IN HIS HAND I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU HAVE I
NOT THAT ONE WAS ELDERLY WITH A BEARD AND THE OTHERS YOUNG
HAIRLESS LADS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN A FATHER WITH HIS TWO SONS THEY
TALKED TOGETHER IN WHISPERS THEN THEY CAME OVER AND MADE SURE THAT I
WAS STILL SECURELY BOUND FINALLY THEY WITHDREW CLOSING THE WINDOW
AFTER THEM IT WAS QUITE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE I GOT MY MOUTH
FREE WHEN I DID SO MY SCREAMS BROUGHT THE MAID TO MY ASSISTANCE THE
OTHER SERVANTS WERE SOON ALARMED AND WE SENT FOR THE LOCAL POLICE
WHO INSTANTLY COMMUNICATED WITH LONDON THAT IS REALLY ALL THAT I CAN
TELL YOU GENTLEMEN AND I TRUST THAT IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY FOR ME
TO GO OVER SO PAINFUL A STORY AGAIN
ANY QUESTIONS MR HOLMES ASKED HOPKINS
I WILL NOT IMPOSE ANY FURTHER TAX UPON LADY BRACKENSTALLS PATIENCE
AND TIME SAID HOLMES BEFORE I GO INTO THE DININGROOM I SHOULD
LIKE TO HEAR YOUR EXPERIENCE HE LOOKED AT THE MAID
I SAW THE MEN BEFORE EVER THEY CAME INTO THE HOUSE SAID SHE AS I
SAT BY MY BEDROOM WINDOW I SAW THREE MEN IN THE MOONLIGHT DOWN BY THE
LODGE GATE YONDER BUT I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT AT THE TIME IT WAS
MORE THAN AN HOUR AFTER THAT I HEARD MY MISTRESS SCREAM AND DOWN I
RAN TO FIND HER POOR LAMB JUST AS SHE SAYS AND HIM ON THE FLOOR
WITH HIS BLOOD AND BRAINS OVER THE ROOM IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE A
WOMAN OUT OF HER WITS TIED THERE AND HER VERY DRESS SPOTTED WITH
HIM BUT SHE NEVER WANTED COURAGE DID MISS MARY FRASER OF ADELAIDE
AND LADY BRACKENSTALL OF ABBEY GRANGE HASNT LEARNED NEW WAYS YOUVE
QUESTIONED HER LONG ENOUGH YOU GENTLEMEN AND NOW SHE IS COMING TO
HER OWN ROOM JUST WITH HER OLD THERESA TO GET THE REST THAT SHE
BADLY NEEDS
WITH A MOTHERLY TENDERNESS THE GAUNT WOMAN PUT HER ARM ROUND HER
MISTRESS AND LED HER FROM THE ROOM
SHE HAS BEEN WITH HER ALL HER LIFE SAID HOPKINS NURSED HER AS A
BABY AND CAME WITH HER TO ENGLAND WHEN THEY FIRST LEFT AUSTRALIA
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO THERESA WRIGHT IS HER NAME AND THE KIND OF MAID
YOU DONT PICK UP NOWADAYS THIS WAY MR HOLMES IF YOU PLEASE
THE KEEN INTEREST HAD PASSED OUT OF HOLMESS EXPRESSIVE FACE AND I
KNEW THAT WITH THE MYSTERY ALL THE CHARM OF THE CASE HAD DEPARTED
THERE STILL REMAINED AN ARREST TO BE EFFECTED BUT WHAT WERE THESE
COMMONPLACE ROGUES THAT HE SHOULD SOIL HIS HANDS WITH THEM AN
ABSTRUSE AND LEARNED SPECIALIST WHO FINDS THAT HE HAS BEEN CALLED IN
FOR A CASE OF MEASLES WOULD EXPERIENCE SOMETHING OF THE ANNOYANCE
WHICH I READ IN MY FRIENDS EYES YET THE SCENE IN THE DININGROOM OF
THE ABBEY GRANGE WAS SUFFICIENTLY STRANGE TO ARREST HIS ATTENTION AND
TO RECALL HIS WANING INTEREST
IT WAS A VERY LARGE AND HIGH CHAMBER WITH CARVED OAK CEILING OAKEN
PANELLING AND A FINE ARRAY OF DEERS HEADS AND ANCIENT WEAPONS
AROUND THE WALLS AT THE FARTHER END FROM THE DOOR WAS THE HIGH
FRENCH WINDOW OF WHICH WE HAD HEARD THREE SMALLER WINDOWS ON THE
RIGHTHAND SIDE FILLED THE APARTMENT WITH COLD WINTER SUNSHINE ON
THE LEFT WAS A LARGE DEEP FIREPLACE WITH A MASSIVE OVERHANGING
OAK MANTELPIECE BESIDE THE FIREPLACE WAS A HEAVY OAKEN CHAIR WITH
ARMS AND CROSSBARS AT THE BOTTOM IN AND OUT THROUGH THE OPEN
WOODWORK WAS WOVEN A CRIMSON CORD WHICH WAS SECURED AT EACH SIDE TO
THE CROSSPIECE BELOW IN RELEASING THE LADY THE CORD HAD BEEN SLIPPED
OFF HER BUT THE KNOTS WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN SECURED STILL REMAINED
THESE DETAILS ONLY STRUCK OUR ATTENTION AFTERWARDS FOR OUR THOUGHTS
WERE ENTIRELY ABSORBED BY THE TERRIBLE OBJECT WHICH LAY UPON THE
TIGERSKIN HEARTHRUG IN FRONT OF THE FIRE
IT WAS THE BODY OF A TALL WELLMADE MAN ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE
HE LAY UPON HIS BACK HIS FACE UPTURNED WITH HIS WHITE TEETH
GRINNING THROUGH HIS SHORT BLACK BEARD HIS TWO CLENCHED HANDS WERE
RAISED ABOVE HIS HEAD AND A HEAVY BLACKTHORN STICK LAY ACROSS THEM
HIS DARK HANDSOME AQUILINE FEATURES WERE CONVULSED INTO A SPASM OF
VINDICTIVE HATRED WHICH HAD SET HIS DEAD FACE IN A TERRIBLY FIENDISH
EXPRESSION HE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN IN HIS BED WHEN THE ALARM HAD
BROKEN OUT FOR HE WORE A FOPPISH EMBROIDERED NIGHTSHIRT AND HIS
BARE FEET PROJECTED FROM HIS TROUSERS HIS HEAD WAS HORRIBLY INJURED
AND THE WHOLE ROOM BORE WITNESS TO THE SAVAGE FEROCITY OF THE BLOW
WHICH HAD STRUCK HIM DOWN BESIDE HIM LAY THE HEAVY POKER BENT INTO
A CURVE BY THE CONCUSSION HOLMES EXAMINED BOTH IT AND THE
INDESCRIBABLE WRECK WHICH IT HAD WROUGHT
HE MUST BE A POWERFUL MAN THIS ELDER RANDALL HE REMARKED
YES SAID HOPKINS I HAVE SOME RECORD OF THE FELLOW AND HE IS A
ROUGH CUSTOMER
YOU SHOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING HIM
NOT THE SLIGHTEST WE HAVE BEEN ON THE LOOKOUT FOR HIM AND THERE
WAS SOME IDEA THAT HE HAD GOT AWAY TO AMERICA NOW THAT WE KNOW THE
GANG ARE HERE I DONT SEE HOW THEY CAN ESCAPE WE HAVE THE NEWS AT
EVERY SEAPORT ALREADY AND A REWARD WILL BE OFFERED BEFORE EVENING
WHAT BEATS ME IS HOW THEY COULD HAVE DONE SO MAD A THING KNOWING
THAT THE LADY COULD DESCRIBE THEM AND THAT WE COULD NOT FAIL TO
RECOGNISE THE DESCRIPTION
EXACTLY ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SILENCED LADY
BRACKENSTALL AS WELL
THEY MAY NOT HAVE REALIZED I SUGGESTED THAT SHE HAD RECOVERED
FROM HER FAINT
THAT IS LIKELY ENOUGH IF SHE SEEMED TO BE SENSELESS THEY WOULD NOT
TAKE HER LIFE WHAT ABOUT THIS POOR FELLOW HOPKINS I SEEM TO HAVE
HEARD SOME QUEER STORIES ABOUT HIM
HE WAS A GOODHEARTED MAN WHEN HE WAS SOBER BUT A PERFECT FIEND
WHEN HE WAS DRUNK OR RATHER WHEN HE WAS HALF DRUNK FOR HE SELDOM
REALLY WENT THE WHOLE WAY THE DEVIL SEEMED TO BE IN HIM AT SUCH
TIMES AND HE WAS CAPABLE OF ANYTHING FROM WHAT I HEAR IN SPITE OF
ALL HIS WEALTH AND HIS TITLE HE VERY NEARLY CAME OUR WAY ONCE OR
TWICE THERE WAS A SCANDAL ABOUT HIS DRENCHING A DOG WITH PETROLEUM
AND SETTING IT ON FIREHER LADYSHIPS DOG TO MAKE THE MATTER
WORSEAND THAT WAS ONLY HUSHED UP WITH DIFFICULTY THEN HE THREW A
DECANTER AT THAT MAID THERESA WRIGHT THERE WAS TROUBLE ABOUT THAT
ON THE WHOLE AND BETWEEN OURSELVES IT WILL BE A BRIGHTER HOUSE
WITHOUT HIM WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT NOW
HOLMES WAS DOWN ON HIS KNEES EXAMINING WITH GREAT ATTENTION THE KNOTS
UPON THE RED CORD WITH WHICH THE LADY HAD BEEN SECURED THEN HE
CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED THE BROKEN AND FRAYED END WHERE IT HAD SNAPPED
OFF WHEN THE BURGLAR HAD DRAGGED IT DOWN
WHEN THIS WAS PULLED DOWN THE BELL IN THE KITCHEN MUST HAVE RUNG
LOUDLY HE REMARKED
NO ONE COULD HEAR IT THE KITCHEN STANDS RIGHT AT THE BACK OF THE
HOUSE
HOW DID THE BURGLAR KNOW NO ONE WOULD HEAR IT HOW DARED HE PULL AT
A BELLROPE IN THAT RECKLESS FASHION
EXACTLY MR HOLMES EXACTLY YOU PUT THE VERY QUESTION WHICH I HAVE
ASKED MYSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THIS FELLOW
MUST HAVE KNOWN THE HOUSE AND ITS HABITS HE MUST HAVE PERFECTLY
UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SERVANTS WOULD ALL BE IN BED AT THAT
COMPARATIVELY EARLY HOUR AND THAT NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY HEAR A BELL
RING IN THE KITCHEN THEREFORE HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE LEAGUE WITH
ONE OF THE SERVANTS SURELY THAT IS EVIDENT BUT THERE ARE EIGHT
SERVANTS AND ALL OF GOOD CHARACTER
OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL SAID HOLMES ONE WOULD SUSPECT THE ONE
AT WHOSE HEAD THE MASTER THREW A DECANTER AND YET THAT WOULD INVOLVE
TREACHERY TOWARDS THE MISTRESS TO WHOM THIS WOMAN SEEMS DEVOTED
WELL WELL THE POINT IS A MINOR ONE AND WHEN YOU HAVE RANDALL YOU
WILL PROBABLY FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN SECURING HIS ACCOMPLICE THE
LADYS STORY CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE CORROBORATED IF IT NEEDED
CORROBORATION BY EVERY DETAIL WHICH WE SEE BEFORE US HE WALKED TO
THE FRENCH WINDOW AND THREW IT OPEN THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE BUT
THE GROUND IS IRON HARD AND ONE WOULD NOT EXPECT THEM I SEE THAT
THESE CANDLES ON THE MANTELPIECE HAVE BEEN LIGHTED
YES IT WAS BY THEIR LIGHT AND THAT OF THE LADYS BEDROOM CANDLE
THAT THE BURGLARS SAW THEIR WAY ABOUT
AND WHAT DID THEY TAKE
WELL THEY DID NOT TAKE MUCHONLY HALFADOZEN ARTICLES OF PLATE
OFF THE SIDEBOARD LADY BRACKENSTALL THINKS THAT THEY WERE THEMSELVES
SO DISTURBED BY THE DEATH OF SIR EUSTACE THAT THEY DID NOT RANSACK
THE HOUSE AS THEY WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE
NO DOUBT THAT IS TRUE AND YET THEY DRANK SOME WINE I UNDERSTAND
TO STEADY THEIR OWN NERVES
EXACTLY THESE THREE GLASSES UPON THE SIDEBOARD HAVE BEEN UNTOUCHED
I SUPPOSE
YES AND THE BOTTLE STANDS AS THEY LEFT IT
LET US LOOK AT IT HALLOA HALLOA WHAT IS THIS
THE THREE GLASSES WERE GROUPED TOGETHER ALL OF THEM TINGED WITH
WINE AND ONE OF THEM CONTAINING SOME DREGS OF BEESWING THE BOTTLE
STOOD NEAR THEM TWOTHIRDS FULL AND BESIDE IT LAY A LONG
DEEPLYSTAINED CORK ITS APPEARANCE AND THE DUST UPON THE BOTTLE
SHOWED THAT IT WAS NO COMMON VINTAGE WHICH THE MURDERERS HAD ENJOYED
A CHANGE HAD COME OVER HOLMESS MANNER HE HAD LOST HIS LISTLESS
EXPRESSION AND AGAIN I SAW AN ALERT LIGHT OF INTEREST IN HIS KEEN
DEEPSET EYES HE RAISED THE CORK AND EXAMINED IT MINUTELY
HOW DID THEY DRAW IT HE ASKED
HOPKINS POINTED TO A HALFOPENED DRAWER IN IT LAY SOME TABLE LINEN
AND A LARGE CORKSCREW
DID LADY BRACKENSTALL SAY THAT SCREW WAS USED
NO YOU REMEMBER THAT SHE WAS SENSELESS AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE
BOTTLE WAS OPENED
QUITE SO AS A MATTER OF FACT THAT SCREW WAS NOT USED THIS BOTTLE
WAS OPENED BY A POCKETSCREW PROBABLY CONTAINED IN A KNIFE AND NOT
MORE THAN AN INCH AND A HALF LONG IF YOU EXAMINE THE TOP OF THE CORK
YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT THE SCREW WAS DRIVEN IN THREE TIMES BEFORE THE
CORK WAS EXTRACTED IT HAS NEVER BEEN TRANSFIXED THIS LONG SCREW
WOULD HAVE TRANSFIXED IT AND DRAWN IT WITH A SINGLE PULL WHEN YOU
CATCH THIS FELLOW YOU WILL FIND THAT HE HAS ONE OF THESE MULTIPLEX
KNIVES IN HIS POSSESSION
EXCELLENT SAID HOPKINS
BUT THESE GLASSES DO PUZZLE ME I CONFESS LADY BRACKENSTALL
ACTUALLY SAW THE THREE MEN DRINKING DID SHE NOT
YES SHE WAS CLEAR ABOUT THAT
THEN THERE IS AN END OF IT WHAT MORE IS TO BE SAID AND YET YOU
MUST ADMIT THAT THE THREE GLASSES ARE VERY REMARKABLE HOPKINS WHAT
YOU SEE NOTHING REMARKABLE WELL WELL LET IT PASS PERHAPS WHEN A
MAN HAS SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE AND SPECIAL POWERS LIKE MY OWN IT RATHER
ENCOURAGES HIM TO SEEK A COMPLEX EXPLANATION WHEN A SIMPLER ONE IS AT
HAND OF COURSE IT MUST BE A MERE CHANCE ABOUT THE GLASSES WELL
GOOD MORNING HOPKINS I DONT SEE THAT I CAN BE OF ANY USE TO YOU
AND YOU APPEAR TO HAVE YOUR CASE VERY CLEAR YOU WILL LET ME KNOW
WHEN RANDALL IS ARRESTED AND ANY FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MAY
OCCUR I TRUST THAT I SHALL SOON HAVE TO CONGRATULATE YOU UPON A
SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION COME WATSON I FANCY THAT WE MAY EMPLOY
OURSELVES MORE PROFITABLY AT HOME
DURING OUR RETURN JOURNEY I COULD SEE BY HOLMESS FACE THAT HE WAS
MUCH PUZZLED BY SOMETHING WHICH HE HAD OBSERVED EVERY NOW AND THEN
BY AN EFFORT HE WOULD THROW OFF THE IMPRESSION AND TALK AS IF THE
MATTER WERE CLEAR BUT THEN HIS DOUBTS WOULD SETTLE DOWN UPON HIM
AGAIN AND HIS KNITTED BROWS AND ABSTRACTED EYES WOULD SHOW THAT HIS
THOUGHTS HAD GONE BACK ONCE MORE TO THE GREAT DININGROOM OF THE
ABBEY GRANGE IN WHICH THIS MIDNIGHT TRAGEDY HAD BEEN ENACTED AT
LAST BY A SUDDEN IMPULSE JUST AS OUR TRAIN WAS CRAWLING OUT OF A
SUBURBAN STATION HE SPRANG ON TO THE PLATFORM AND PULLED ME OUT
AFTER HIM
EXCUSE ME MY DEAR FELLOW SAID HE AS WE WATCHED THE REAR
CARRIAGES OF OUR TRAIN DISAPPEARING ROUND A CURVE I AM SORRY TO
MAKE YOU THE VICTIM OF WHAT MAY SEEM A MERE WHIM BUT ON MY LIFE
WATSON I SIMPLY CANT LEAVE THAT CASE IN THIS CONDITION EVERY
INSTINCT THAT I POSSESS CRIES OUT AGAINST IT ITS WRONGITS ALL
WRONGILL SWEAR THAT ITS WRONG AND YET THE LADYS STORY WAS
COMPLETE THE MAIDS CORROBORATION WAS SUFFICIENT THE DETAIL WAS
FAIRLY EXACT WHAT HAVE I TO PUT AGAINST THAT THREE WINEGLASSES
THAT IS ALL BUT IF I HAD NOT TAKEN THINGS FOR GRANTED IF I HAD
EXAMINED EVERYTHING WITH CARE WHICH I WOULD HAVE SHOWN HAD WE
APPROACHED THE CASE DE NOVO AND HAD NO CUTANDDRIED STORY TO WARP MY
MIND WOULD I NOT THEN HAVE FOUND SOMETHING MORE DEFINITE TO GO UPON
OF COURSE I SHOULD SIT DOWN ON THIS BENCH WATSON UNTIL A TRAIN FOR
CHISLEHURST ARRIVES AND ALLOW ME TO LAY THE EVIDENCE BEFORE YOU
IMPLORING YOU IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO DISMISS FROM YOUR MIND THE
IDEA THAT ANYTHING WHICH THE MAID OR HER MISTRESS MAY HAVE SAID MUST
NECESSARILY BE TRUE THE LADYS CHARMING PERSONALITY MUST NOT BE
PERMITTED TO WARP OUR JUDGMENT
SURELY THERE ARE DETAILS IN HER STORY WHICH IF WE LOOKED AT IT IN
COLD BLOOD WOULD EXCITE OUR SUSPICION THESE BURGLARS MADE A
CONSIDERABLE HAUL AT SYDENHAM A FORTNIGHT AGO SOME ACCOUNT OF THEM
AND OF THEIR APPEARANCE WAS IN THE PAPERS AND WOULD NATURALLY OCCUR
TO ANYONE WHO WISHED TO INVENT A STORY IN WHICH IMAGINARY ROBBERS
SHOULD PLAY A PART AS A MATTER OF FACT BURGLARS WHO HAVE DONE A
GOOD STROKE OF BUSINESS ARE AS A RULE ONLY TOO GLAD TO ENJOY THE
PROCEEDS IN PEACE AND QUIET WITHOUT EMBARKING ON ANOTHER PERILOUS
UNDERTAKING AGAIN IT IS UNUSUAL FOR BURGLARS TO OPERATE AT SO EARLY
AN HOUR IT IS UNUSUAL FOR BURGLARS TO STRIKE A LADY TO PREVENT HER
SCREAMING SINCE ONE WOULD IMAGINE THAT WAS THE SURE WAY TO MAKE HER
SCREAM IT IS UNUSUAL FOR THEM TO COMMIT MURDER WHEN THEIR NUMBERS
ARE SUFFICIENT TO OVERPOWER ONE MAN IT IS UNUSUAL FOR THEM TO BE
CONTENT WITH A LIMITED PLUNDER WHEN THERE IS MUCH MORE WITHIN THEIR
REACH AND FINALLY I SHOULD SAY THAT IT WAS VERY UNUSUAL FOR SUCH MEN
TO LEAVE A BOTTLE HALF EMPTY HOW DO ALL THESE UNUSUALS STRIKE YOU
WATSON
THEIR CUMULATIVE EFFECT IS CERTAINLY CONSIDERABLE AND YET EACH OF
THEM IS QUITE POSSIBLE IN ITSELF THE MOST UNUSUAL THING OF ALL AS
IT SEEMS TO ME IS THAT THE LADY SHOULD BE TIED TO THE CHAIR
WELL I AM NOT SO CLEAR ABOUT THAT WATSON FOR IT IS EVIDENT THAT
THEY MUST EITHER KILL HER OR ELSE SECURE HER IN SUCH A WAY THAT SHE
COULD NOT GIVE IMMEDIATE NOTICE OF THEIR ESCAPE BUT AT ANY RATE I
HAVE SHOWN HAVE I NOT THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN ELEMENT OF
IMPROBABILITY ABOUT THE LADYS STORY AND NOW ON THE TOP OF THIS
COMES THE INCIDENT OF THE WINEGLASSES
WHAT ABOUT THE WINEGLASSES
CAN YOU SEE THEM IN YOUR MINDS EYE
I SEE THEM CLEARLY
WE ARE TOLD THAT THREE MEN DRANK FROM THEM DOES THAT STRIKE YOU AS
LIKELY
WHY NOT THERE WAS WINE IN EACH GLASS
EXACTLY BUT THERE WAS BEESWING ONLY IN ONE GLASS YOU MUST HAVE
NOTICED THAT FACT WHAT DOES THAT SUGGEST TO YOUR MIND
THE LAST GLASS FILLED WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO CONTAIN BEESWING
NOT AT ALL THE BOTTLE WAS FULL OF IT AND IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT
THE FIRST TWO GLASSES WERE CLEAR AND THE THIRD HEAVILY CHARGED WITH
IT THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS AND ONLY TWO ONE IS THAT
AFTER THE SECOND GLASS WAS FILLED THE BOTTLE WAS VIOLENTLY AGITATED
AND SO THE THIRD GLASS RECEIVED THE BEESWING THAT DOES NOT APPEAR
PROBABLE NO NO I AM SURE THAT I AM RIGHT
WHAT THEN DO YOU SUPPOSE
THAT ONLY TWO GLASSES WERE USED AND THAT THE DREGS OF BOTH WERE
POURED INTO A THIRD GLASS SO AS TO GIVE THE FALSE IMPRESSION THAT
THREE PEOPLE HAD BEEN HERE IN THAT WAY ALL THE BEESWING WOULD BE IN
THE LAST GLASS WOULD IT NOT YES I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS IS SO
BUT IF I HAVE HIT UPON THE TRUE EXPLANATION OF THIS ONE SMALL
PHENOMENON THEN IN AN INSTANT THE CASE RISES FROM THE COMMONPLACE TO
THE EXCEEDINGLY REMARKABLE FOR IT CAN ONLY MEAN THAT LADY
BRACKENSTALL AND HER MAID HAVE DELIBERATELY LIED TO US THAT NOT ONE
WORD OF THEIR STORY IS TO BE BELIEVED THAT THEY HAVE SOME VERY
STRONG REASON FOR COVERING THE REAL CRIMINAL AND THAT WE MUST
CONSTRUCT OUR CASE FOR OURSELVES WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM THEM THAT IS
THE MISSION WHICH NOW LIES BEFORE US AND HERE WATSON IS THE
CHISLEHURST TRAIN
THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE ABBEY GRANGE WERE MUCH SURPRISED AT OUR RETURN
BUT SHERLOCK HOLMES FINDING THAT STANLEY HOPKINS HAD GONE OFF TO
REPORT TO HEADQUARTERS TOOK POSSESSION OF THE DININGROOM LOCKED
THE DOOR UPON THE INSIDE AND DEVOTED HIMSELF FOR TWO HOURS TO ONE OF
THOSE MINUTE AND LABORIOUS INVESTIGATIONS WHICH FORMED THE SOLID
BASIS ON WHICH HIS BRILLIANT EDIFICES OF DEDUCTION WERE REARED
SEATED IN A CORNER LIKE AN INTERESTED STUDENT WHO OBSERVES THE
DEMONSTRATION OF HIS PROFESSOR I FOLLOWED EVERY STEP OF THAT
REMARKABLE RESEARCH THE WINDOW THE CURTAINS THE CARPET THE CHAIR
THE ROPEEACH IN TURN WAS MINUTELY EXAMINED AND DULY PONDERED THE
BODY OF THE UNFORTUNATE BARONET HAD BEEN REMOVED BUT ALL ELSE
REMAINED AS WE HAD SEEN IT IN THE MORNING THEN TO MY ASTONISHMENT
HOLMES CLIMBED UP ON TO THE MASSIVE MANTELPIECE FAR ABOVE HIS HEAD
HUNG THE FEW INCHES OF RED CORD WHICH WERE STILL ATTACHED TO THE
WIRE FOR A LONG TIME HE GAZED UPWARD AT IT AND THEN IN AN ATTEMPT
TO GET NEARER TO IT HE RESTED HIS KNEE UPON A WOODEN BRACKET ON THE
WALL THIS BROUGHT HIS HAND WITHIN A FEW INCHES OF THE BROKEN END OF
THE ROPE BUT IT WAS NOT THIS SO MUCH AS THE BRACKET ITSELF WHICH
SEEMED TO ENGAGE HIS ATTENTION FINALLY HE SPRANG DOWN WITH AN
EJACULATION OF SATISFACTION
ITS ALL RIGHT WATSON SAID HE WE HAVE GOT OUR CASEONE OF THE
MOST REMARKABLE IN OUR COLLECTION BUT DEAR ME HOW SLOWWITTED I
HAVE BEEN AND HOW NEARLY I HAVE COMMITTED THE BLUNDER OF MY
LIFETIME NOW I THINK THAT WITH A FEW MISSING LINKS MY CHAIN IS
ALMOST COMPLETE
YOU HAVE GOT YOUR MEN
MAN WATSON MAN ONLY ONE BUT A VERY FORMIDABLE PERSON STRONG AS
A LIONWITNESS THE BLOW THAT BENT THAT POKER SIX FOOT THREE IN
HEIGHT ACTIVE AS A SQUIRREL DEXTEROUS WITH HIS FINGERS FINALLY
REMARKABLY QUICKWITTED FOR THIS WHOLE INGENIOUS STORY IS OF HIS
CONCOCTION YES WATSON WE HAVE COME UPON THE HANDIWORK OF A VERY
REMARKABLE INDIVIDUAL AND YET IN THAT BELLROPE HE HAS GIVEN US A
CLUE WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT US A DOUBT
WHERE WAS THE CLUE
WELL IF YOU WERE TO PULL DOWN A BELLROPE WATSON WHERE WOULD YOU
EXPECT IT TO BREAK SURELY AT THE SPOT WHERE IT IS ATTACHED TO THE
WIRE WHY SHOULD IT BREAK THREE INCHES FROM THE TOP AS THIS ONE HAS
DONE
BECAUSE IT IS FRAYED THERE
EXACTLY THIS END WHICH WE CAN EXAMINE IS FRAYED HE WAS CUNNING
ENOUGH TO DO THAT WITH HIS KNIFE BUT THE OTHER END IS NOT FRAYED
YOU COULD NOT OBSERVE THAT FROM HERE BUT IF YOU WERE ON THE
MANTELPIECE YOU WOULD SEE THAT IT IS CUT CLEAN OFF WITHOUT ANY MARK
OF FRAYING WHATEVER YOU CAN RECONSTRUCT WHAT OCCURRED THE MAN
NEEDED THE ROPE HE WOULD NOT TEAR IT DOWN FOR FEAR OF GIVING THE
ALARM BY RINGING THE BELL WHAT DID HE DO HE SPRANG UP ON THE
MANTELPIECE COULD NOT QUITE REACH IT PUT HIS KNEE ON THE
BRACKETYOU WILL SEE THE IMPRESSION IN THE DUSTAND SO GOT HIS
KNIFE TO BEAR UPON THE CORD I COULD NOT REACH THE PLACE BY AT LEAST
THREE INCHES FROM WHICH I INFER THAT HE IS AT LEAST THREE INCHES A
BIGGER MAN THAN I LOOK AT THAT MARK UPON THE SEAT OF THE OAKEN
CHAIR WHAT IS IT
BLOOD
UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS BLOOD THIS ALONE PUTS THE LADYS STORY OUT OF
COURT IF SHE WERE SEATED ON THE CHAIR WHEN THE CRIME WAS DONE HOW
COMES THAT MARK NO NO SHE WAS PLACED IN THE CHAIR AFTER THE DEATH
OF HER HUSBAND ILL WAGER THAT THE BLACK DRESS SHOWS A CORRESPONDING
MARK TO THIS WE HAVE NOT YET MET OUR WATERLOO WATSON BUT THIS IS
OUR MARENGO FOR IT BEGINS IN DEFEAT AND ENDS IN VICTORY I SHOULD
LIKE NOW TO HAVE A FEW WORDS WITH THE NURSE THERESA WE MUST BE WARY
FOR AWHILE IF WE ARE TO GET THE INFORMATION WHICH WE WANT
SHE WAS AN INTERESTING PERSON THIS STERN AUSTRALIAN NURSE TACITURN
SUSPICIOUS UNGRACIOUS IT TOOK SOME TIME BEFORE HOLMESS PLEASANT
MANNER AND FRANK ACCEPTANCE OF ALL THAT SHE SAID THAWED HER INTO A
CORRESPONDING AMIABILITY SHE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL HER HATRED
FOR HER LATE EMPLOYER
YES SIR IT IS TRUE THAT HE THREW THE DECANTER AT ME I HEARD HIM
CALL MY MISTRESS A NAME AND I TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT DARE TO
SPEAK SO IF HER BROTHER HAD BEEN THERE THEN IT WAS THAT HE THREW IT
AT ME HE MIGHT HAVE THROWN A DOZEN IF HE HAD BUT LEFT MY BONNY BIRD
ALONE HE WAS FOR EVER ILLTREATING HER AND SHE TOO PROUD TO
COMPLAIN SHE WILL NOT EVEN TELL ME ALL THAT HE HAS DONE TO HER SHE
NEVER TOLD ME OF THOSE MARKS ON HER ARM THAT YOU SAW THIS MORNING
BUT I KNOW VERY WELL THAT THEY COME FROM A STAB WITH A HATPIN THE
SLY FIENDHEAVEN FORGIVE ME THAT I SHOULD SPEAK OF HIM SO NOW THAT
HE IS DEAD BUT A FIEND HE WAS IF EVER ONE WALKED THE EARTH HE WAS
ALL HONEY WHEN FIRST WE MET HIM ONLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO AND WE
BOTH FEEL AS IF IT WERE EIGHTEEN YEARS SHE HAD ONLY JUST ARRIVED IN
LONDON YES IT WAS HER FIRST VOYAGESHE HAD NEVER BEEN FROM HOME
BEFORE HE WON HER WITH HIS TITLE AND HIS MONEY AND HIS FALSE LONDON
WAYS IF SHE MADE A MISTAKE SHE HAS PAID FOR IT IF EVER A WOMAN DID
WHAT MONTH DID WE MEET HIM WELL I TELL YOU IT WAS JUST AFTER WE
ARRIVED WE ARRIVED IN JUNE AND IT WAS JULY THEY WERE MARRIED IN
JANUARY OF LAST YEAR YES SHE IS DOWN IN THE MORNINGROOM AGAIN AND
I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE WILL SEE YOU BUT YOU MUST NOT ASK TOO MUCH OF
HER FOR SHE HAS GONE THROUGH ALL THAT FLESH AND BLOOD WILL STAND
LADY BRACKENSTALL WAS RECLINING ON THE SAME COUCH BUT LOOKED
BRIGHTER THAN BEFORE THE MAID HAD ENTERED WITH US AND BEGAN ONCE
MORE TO FOMENT THE BRUISE UPON HER MISTRESSS BROW
I HOPE SAID THE LADY THAT YOU HAVE NOT COME TO CROSSEXAMINE ME
AGAIN
NO HOLMES ANSWERED IN HIS GENTLEST VOICE I WILL NOT CAUSE YOU
ANY UNNECESSARY TROUBLE LADY BRACKENSTALL AND MY WHOLE DESIRE IS TO
MAKE THINGS EASY FOR YOU FOR I AM CONVINCED THAT YOU ARE A
MUCHTRIED WOMAN IF YOU WILL TREAT ME AS A FRIEND AND TRUST ME YOU
MAY FIND THAT I WILL JUSTIFY YOUR TRUST
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH
MR HOLMES
NO NO LADY BRACKENSTALL IT IS NO USE YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF ANY
LITTLE REPUTATION WHICH I POSSESS I WILL STAKE IT ALL ON THE FACT
THAT YOUR STORY IS AN ABSOLUTE FABRICATION
MISTRESS AND MAID WERE BOTH STARING AT HOLMES WITH PALE FACES AND
FRIGHTENED EYES
YOU ARE AN IMPUDENT FELLOW CRIED THERESA DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT
MY MISTRESS HAS TOLD A LIE
HOLMES ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR
HAVE YOU NOTHING TO TELL ME
I HAVE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
THINK ONCE MORE LADY BRACKENSTALL WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO BE
FRANK
FOR AN INSTANT THERE WAS HESITATION IN HER BEAUTIFUL FACE THEN SOME
NEW STRONG THOUGHT CAUSED IT TO SET LIKE A MASK
I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL I KNOW
HOLMES TOOK HIS HAT AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I AM SORRY HE
SAID AND WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD WE LEFT THE ROOM AND THE HOUSE THERE
WAS A POND IN THE PARK AND TO THIS MY FRIEND LED THE WAY IT WAS
FROZEN OVER BUT A SINGLE HOLE WAS LEFT FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF A
SOLITARY SWAN HOLMES GAZED AT IT AND THEN PASSED ON TO THE LODGE
GATE THERE HE SCRIBBLED A SHORT NOTE FOR STANLEY HOPKINS AND LEFT IT
WITH THE LODGEKEEPER
IT MAY BE A HIT OR IT MAY BE A MISS BUT WE ARE BOUND TO DO
SOMETHING FOR FRIEND HOPKINS JUST TO JUSTIFY THIS SECOND VISIT
SAID HE I WILL NOT QUITE TAKE HIM INTO MY CONFIDENCE YET I THINK
OUR NEXT SCENE OF OPERATIONS MUST BE THE SHIPPING OFFICE OF THE
ADELAIDESOUTHAMPTON LINE WHICH STANDS AT THE END OF PALL MALL IF I
REMEMBER RIGHT THERE IS A SECOND LINE OF STEAMERS WHICH CONNECT
SOUTH AUSTRALIA WITH ENGLAND BUT WE WILL DRAW THE LARGER COVER
FIRST
HOLMESS CARD SENT IN TO THE MANAGER ENSURED INSTANT ATTENTION AND
HE WAS NOT LONG IN ACQUIRING ALL THE INFORMATION WHICH HE NEEDED IN
JUNE OF ONLY ONE OF THEIR LINE HAD REACHED A HOME PORT IT WAS
THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR THEIR LARGEST AND BEST BOAT A REFERENCE TO
THE PASSENGER LIST SHOWED THAT MISS FRASER OF ADELAIDE WITH HER
MAID HAD MADE THE VOYAGE IN HER THE BOAT WAS NOW ON HER WAY TO
AUSTRALIA SOMEWHERE TO THE SOUTH OF THE SUEZ CANAL HER OFFICERS
WERE THE SAME AS IN WITH ONE EXCEPTION THE FIRST OFFICER MR
JACK CROKER HAD BEEN MADE A CAPTAIN AND WAS TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEIR
NEW SHIP THE BASS ROCK SAILING IN TWO DAYS TIME FROM SOUTHAMPTON
HE LIVED AT SYDENHAM BUT HE WAS LIKELY TO BE IN THAT MORNING FOR
INSTRUCTIONS IF WE CARED TO WAIT FOR HIM
NO MR HOLMES HAD NO DESIRE TO SEE HIM BUT WOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW
MORE ABOUT HIS RECORD AND CHARACTER
HIS RECORD WAS MAGNIFICENT THERE WAS NOT AN OFFICER IN THE FLEET TO
TOUCH HIM AS TO HIS CHARACTER HE WAS RELIABLE ON DUTY BUT A WILD
DESPERATE FELLOW OFF THE DECK OF HIS SHIP HOTHEADED EXCITABLE BUT
LOYAL HONEST AND KINDHEARTED THAT WAS THE PITH OF THE INFORMATION
WITH WHICH HOLMES LEFT THE OFFICE OF THE ADELAIDESOUTHAMPTON
COMPANY THENCE HE DROVE TO SCOTLAND YARD BUT INSTEAD OF ENTERING HE
SAT IN HIS CAB WITH HIS BROWS DRAWN DOWN LOST IN PROFOUND THOUGHT
FINALLY HE DROVE ROUND TO THE CHARING CROSS TELEGRAPH OFFICE SENT
OFF A MESSAGE AND THEN AT LAST WE MADE FOR BAKER STREET ONCE MORE
NO I COULDNT DO IT WATSON SAID HE AS WE REENTERED OUR ROOM
ONCE THAT WARRANT WAS MADE OUT NOTHING ON EARTH WOULD SAVE HIM ONCE
OR TWICE IN MY CAREER I FEEL THAT I HAVE DONE MORE REAL HARM BY MY
DISCOVERY OF THE CRIMINAL THAN EVER HE HAD DONE BY HIS CRIME I HAVE
LEARNED CAUTION NOW AND I HAD RATHER PLAY TRICKS WITH THE LAW OF
ENGLAND THAN WITH MY OWN CONSCIENCE LET US KNOW A LITTLE MORE BEFORE
WE ACT
BEFORE EVENING WE HAD A VISIT FROM INSPECTOR STANLEY HOPKINS THINGS
WERE NOT GOING VERY WELL WITH HIM
I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE A WIZARD MR HOLMES I REALLY DO SOMETIMES
THINK THAT YOU HAVE POWERS THAT ARE NOT HUMAN NOW HOW ON EARTH
COULD YOU KNOW THAT THE STOLEN SILVER WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT
POND
I DIDNT KNOW IT
BUT YOU TOLD ME TO EXAMINE IT
YOU GOT IT THEN
YES I GOT IT
I AM VERY GLAD IF I HAVE HELPED YOU
BUT YOU HAVENT HELPED ME YOU HAVE MADE THE AFFAIR FAR MORE
DIFFICULT WHAT SORT OF BURGLARS ARE THEY WHO STEAL SILVER AND THEN
THROW IT INTO THE NEAREST POND
IT WAS CERTAINLY RATHER ECCENTRIC BEHAVIOUR I WAS MERELY GOING ON
THE IDEA THAT IF THE SILVER HAD BEEN TAKEN BY PERSONS WHO DID NOT
WANT IT WHO MERELY TOOK IT FOR A BLIND AS IT WERE THEN THEY WOULD
NATURALLY BE ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF IT
BUT WHY SHOULD SUCH AN IDEA CROSS YOUR MIND
WELL I THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE WHEN THEY CAME OUT THROUGH THE
FRENCH WINDOW THERE WAS THE POND WITH ONE TEMPTING LITTLE HOLE IN
THE ICE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR NOSES COULD THERE BE A BETTER
HIDINGPLACE
AH A HIDINGPLACETHAT IS BETTER CRIED STANLEY HOPKINS YES
YES I SEE IT ALL NOW IT WAS EARLY THERE WERE FOLK UPON THE ROADS
THEY WERE AFRAID OF BEING SEEN WITH THE SILVER SO THEY SANK IT IN
THE POND INTENDING TO RETURN FOR IT WHEN THE COAST WAS CLEAR
EXCELLENT MR HOLMESTHAT IS BETTER THAN YOUR IDEA OF A BLIND
QUITE SO YOU HAVE GOT AN ADMIRABLE THEORY I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT MY
OWN IDEAS WERE QUITE WILD BUT YOU MUST ADMIT THAT THEY HAVE ENDED IN
DISCOVERING THE SILVER
YES SIR YES IT WAS ALL YOUR DOING BUT I HAVE HAD A BAD
SETBACK
A SETBACK
YES MR HOLMES THE RANDALL GANG WERE ARRESTED IN NEW YORK THIS
MORNING
DEAR ME HOPKINS THAT IS CERTAINLY RATHER AGAINST YOUR THEORY THAT
THEY COMMITTED A MURDER IN KENT LAST NIGHT
IT IS FATAL MR HOLMES ABSOLUTELY FATAL STILL THERE ARE OTHER
GANGS OF THREE BESIDES THE RANDALLS OR IT MAY BE SOME NEW GANG OF
WHICH THE POLICE HAVE NEVER HEARD
QUITE SO IT IS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE WHAT ARE YOU OFF
YES MR HOLMES THERE IS NO REST FOR ME UNTIL I HAVE GOT TO THE
BOTTOM OF THE BUSINESS I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NO HINT TO GIVE ME
I HAVE GIVEN YOU ONE
WHICH
WELL I SUGGESTED A BLIND
BUT WHY MR HOLMES WHY
AH THATS THE QUESTION OF COURSE BUT I COMMEND THE IDEA TO YOUR
MIND YOU MIGHT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN IT YOU
WONT STOP FOR DINNER WELL GOODBYE AND LET US KNOW HOW YOU GET
ON
DINNER WAS OVER AND THE TABLE CLEARED BEFORE HOLMES ALLUDED TO THE
MATTER AGAIN HE HAD LIT HIS PIPE AND HELD HIS SLIPPERED FEET TO THE
CHEERFUL BLAZE OF THE FIRE SUDDENLY HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
I EXPECT DEVELOPMENTS WATSON
WHEN
NOWWITHIN A FEW MINUTES I DARE SAY YOU THOUGHT I ACTED RATHER
BADLY TO STANLEY HOPKINS JUST NOW
I TRUST YOUR JUDGMENT
A VERY SENSIBLE REPLY WATSON YOU MUST LOOK AT IT THIS WAY WHAT I
KNOW IS UNOFFICIAL WHAT HE KNOWS IS OFFICIAL I HAVE THE RIGHT TO
PRIVATE JUDGMENT BUT HE HAS NONE HE MUST DISCLOSE ALL OR HE IS A
TRAITOR TO HIS SERVICE IN A DOUBTFUL CASE I WOULD NOT PUT HIM IN SO
PAINFUL A POSITION AND SO I RESERVE MY INFORMATION UNTIL MY OWN MIND
IS CLEAR UPON THE MATTER
BUT WHEN WILL THAT BE
THE TIME HAS COME YOU WILL NOW BE PRESENT AT THE LAST SCENE OF A
REMARKABLE LITTLE DRAMA
THERE WAS A SOUND UPON THE STAIRS AND OUR DOOR WAS OPENED TO ADMIT
AS FINE A SPECIMEN OF MANHOOD AS EVER PASSED THROUGH IT HE WAS A
VERY TALL YOUNG MAN GOLDENMOUSTACHED BLUEEYED WITH A SKIN WHICH
HAD BEEN BURNED BY TROPICAL SUNS AND A SPRINGY STEP WHICH SHOWED
THAT THE HUGE FRAME WAS AS ACTIVE AS IT WAS STRONG HE CLOSED THE
DOOR BEHIND HIM AND THEN HE STOOD WITH CLENCHED HANDS AND HEAVING
BREAST CHOKING DOWN SOME OVERMASTERING EMOTION
SIT DOWN CAPTAIN CROKER YOU GOT MY TELEGRAM
OUR VISITOR SANK INTO AN ARMCHAIR AND LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
OF US WITH QUESTIONING EYES
I GOT YOUR TELEGRAM AND I CAME AT THE HOUR YOU SAID I HEARD THAT
YOU HAD BEEN DOWN TO THE OFFICE THERE WAS NO GETTING AWAY FROM YOU
LETS HEAR THE WORST WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH ME ARREST ME
SPEAK OUT MAN YOU CANT SIT THERE AND PLAY WITH ME LIKE A CAT WITH
A MOUSE
GIVE HIM A CIGAR SAID HOLMES BITE ON THAT CAPTAIN CROKER AND
DONT LET YOUR NERVES RUN AWAY WITH YOU I SHOULD NOT SIT HERE
SMOKING WITH YOU IF I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE A COMMON CRIMINAL YOU
MAY BE SURE OF THAT BE FRANK WITH ME AND WE MAY DO SOME GOOD PLAY
TRICKS WITH ME AND ILL CRUSH YOU
WHAT DO YOU WISH ME TO DO
TO GIVE ME A TRUE ACCOUNT OF ALL THAT HAPPENED AT THE ABBEY GRANGE
LAST NIGHTA TRUE ACCOUNT MIND YOU WITH NOTHING ADDED AND NOTHING
TAKEN OFF I KNOW SO MUCH ALREADY THAT IF YOU GO ONE INCH OFF THE
STRAIGHT ILL BLOW THIS POLICE WHISTLE FROM MY WINDOW AND THE AFFAIR
GOES OUT OF MY HANDS FOR EVER
THE SAILOR THOUGHT FOR A LITTLE THEN HE STRUCK HIS LEG WITH HIS
GREAT SUNBURNED HAND
ILL CHANCE IT HE CRIED I BELIEVE YOU ARE A MAN OF YOUR WORD
AND A WHITE MAN AND ILL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY BUT ONE THING I
WILL SAY FIRST SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I REGRET NOTHING AND I FEAR
NOTHING AND I WOULD DO IT ALL AGAIN AND BE PROUD OF THE JOB CURSE
THE BEAST IF HE HAD AS MANY LIVES AS A CAT HE WOULD OWE THEM ALL TO
ME BUT ITS THE LADY MARYMARY FRASERFOR NEVER WILL I CALL HER
BY THAT ACCURSED NAME WHEN I THINK OF GETTING HER INTO TROUBLE I
WHO WOULD GIVE MY LIFE JUST TO BRING ONE SMILE TO HER DEAR FACE ITS
THAT THAT TURNS MY SOUL INTO WATER AND YETAND YETWHAT LESS COULD
I DO ILL TELL YOU MY STORY GENTLEMEN AND THEN ILL ASK YOU AS MAN
TO MAN WHAT LESS COULD I DO
I MUST GO BACK A BIT YOU SEEM TO KNOW EVERYTHING SO I EXPECT THAT
YOU KNOW THAT I MET HER WHEN SHE WAS A PASSENGER AND I WAS FIRST
OFFICER OF THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR FROM THE FIRST DAY I MET HER SHE
WAS THE ONLY WOMAN TO ME EVERY DAY OF THAT VOYAGE I LOVED HER MORE
AND MANY A TIME SINCE HAVE I KNEELED DOWN IN THE DARKNESS OF THE
NIGHT WATCH AND KISSED THE DECK OF THAT SHIP BECAUSE I KNEW HER DEAR
FEET HAD TROD IT SHE WAS NEVER ENGAGED TO ME SHE TREATED ME AS
FAIRLY AS EVER A WOMAN TREATED A MAN I HAVE NO COMPLAINT TO MAKE IT
WAS ALL LOVE ON MY SIDE AND ALL GOOD COMRADESHIP AND FRIENDSHIP ON
HERS WHEN WE PARTED SHE WAS A FREE WOMAN BUT I COULD NEVER AGAIN BE
A FREE MAN
NEXT TIME I CAME BACK FROM SEA I HEARD OF HER MARRIAGE WELL WHY
SHOULDNT SHE MARRY WHOM SHE LIKED TITLE AND MONEYWHO COULD CARRY
THEM BETTER THAN SHE SHE WAS BORN FOR ALL THAT IS BEAUTIFUL AND
DAINTY I DIDNT GRIEVE OVER HER MARRIAGE I WAS NOT SUCH A SELFISH
HOUND AS THAT I JUST REJOICED THAT GOOD LUCK HAD COME HER WAY AND
THAT SHE HAD NOT THROWN HERSELF AWAY ON A PENNILESS SAILOR THATS
HOW I LOVED MARY FRASER
WELL I NEVER THOUGHT TO SEE HER AGAIN BUT LAST VOYAGE I WAS
PROMOTED AND THE NEW BOAT WAS NOT YET LAUNCHED SO I HAD TO WAIT FOR
A COUPLE OF MONTHS WITH MY PEOPLE AT SYDENHAM ONE DAY OUT IN A
COUNTRY LANE I MET THERESA WRIGHT HER OLD MAID SHE TOLD ME ABOUT
HER ABOUT HIM ABOUT EVERYTHING I TELL YOU GENTLEMEN IT NEARLY
DROVE ME MAD THIS DRUNKEN HOUND THAT HE SHOULD DARE TO RAISE HIS
HAND TO HER WHOSE BOOTS HE WAS NOT WORTHY TO LICK I MET THERESA
AGAIN THEN I MET MARY HERSELFAND MET HER AGAIN THEN SHE WOULD
MEET ME NO MORE BUT THE OTHER DAY I HAD A NOTICE THAT I WAS TO START
ON MY VOYAGE WITHIN A WEEK AND I DETERMINED THAT I WOULD SEE HER
ONCE BEFORE I LEFT THERESA WAS ALWAYS MY FRIEND FOR SHE LOVED MARY
AND HATED THIS VILLAIN ALMOST AS MUCH AS I DID FROM HER I LEARNED
THE WAYS OF THE HOUSE MARY USED TO SIT UP READING IN HER OWN LITTLE
ROOM DOWNSTAIRS I CREPT ROUND THERE LAST NIGHT AND SCRATCHED AT THE
WINDOW AT FIRST SHE WOULD NOT OPEN TO ME BUT IN HER HEART I KNOW
THAT NOW SHE LOVES ME AND SHE COULD NOT LEAVE ME IN THE FROSTY
NIGHT SHE WHISPERED TO ME TO COME ROUND TO THE BIG FRONT WINDOW AND
I FOUND IT OPEN BEFORE ME SO AS TO LET ME INTO THE DININGROOM AGAIN
I HEARD FROM HER OWN LIPS THINGS THAT MADE MY BLOOD BOIL AND AGAIN I
CURSED THIS BRUTE WHO MISHANDLED THE WOMAN THAT I LOVED WELL
GENTLEMEN I WAS STANDING WITH HER JUST INSIDE THE WINDOW IN ALL
INNOCENCE AS HEAVEN IS MY JUDGE WHEN HE RUSHED LIKE A MADMAN INTO
THE ROOM CALLED HER THE VILEST NAME THAT A MAN COULD USE TO A WOMAN
AND WELTED HER ACROSS THE FACE WITH THE STICK HE HAD IN HIS HAND I
HAD SPRUNG FOR THE POKER AND IT WAS A FAIR FIGHT BETWEEN US SEE
HERE ON MY ARM WHERE HIS FIRST BLOW FELL THEN IT WAS MY TURN AND I
WENT THROUGH HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN A ROTTEN PUMPKIN DO YOU THINK I
WAS SORRY NOT I IT WAS HIS LIFE OR MINE BUT FAR MORE THAN THAT IT
WAS HIS LIFE OR HERS FOR HOW COULD I LEAVE HER IN THE POWER OF THIS
MADMAN THAT WAS HOW I KILLED HIM WAS I WRONG WELL THEN WHAT
WOULD EITHER OF YOU GENTLEMEN HAVE DONE IF YOU HAD BEEN IN MY
POSITION
SHE HAD SCREAMED WHEN HE STRUCK HER AND THAT BROUGHT OLD THERESA
DOWN FROM THE ROOM ABOVE THERE WAS A BOTTLE OF WINE ON THE
SIDEBOARD AND I OPENED IT AND POURED A LITTLE BETWEEN MARYS LIPS
FOR SHE WAS HALF DEAD WITH THE SHOCK THEN I TOOK A DROP MYSELF
THERESA WAS AS COOL AS ICE AND IT WAS HER PLOT AS MUCH AS MINE WE
MUST MAKE IT APPEAR THAT BURGLARS HAD DONE THE THING THERESA KEPT ON
REPEATING OUR STORY TO HER MISTRESS WHILE I SWARMED UP AND CUT THE
ROPE OF THE BELL THEN I LASHED HER IN HER CHAIR AND FRAYED OUT THE
END OF THE ROPE TO MAKE IT LOOK NATURAL ELSE THEY WOULD WONDER HOW
IN THE WORLD A BURGLAR COULD HAVE GOT UP THERE TO CUT IT THEN I
GATHERED UP A FEW PLATES AND POTS OF SILVER TO CARRY OUT THE IDEA OF
A ROBBERY AND THERE I LEFT THEM WITH ORDERS TO GIVE THE ALARM WHEN I
HAD A QUARTER OF AN HOURS START I DROPPED THE SILVER INTO THE POND
AND MADE OFF FOR SYDENHAM FEELING THAT FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE I HAD
DONE A REAL GOOD NIGHTS WORK AND THATS THE TRUTH AND THE WHOLE
TRUTH MR HOLMES IF IT COSTS ME MY NECK
HOLMES SMOKED FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE THEN HE CROSSED THE ROOM AND
SHOOK OUR VISITOR BY THE HAND
THATS WHAT I THINK SAID HE I KNOW THAT EVERY WORD IS TRUE FOR
YOU HAVE HARDLY SAID A WORD WHICH I DID NOT KNOW NO ONE BUT AN
ACROBAT OR A SAILOR COULD HAVE GOT UP TO THAT BELLROPE FROM THE
BRACKET AND NO ONE BUT A SAILOR COULD HAVE MADE THE KNOTS WITH WHICH
THE CORD WAS FASTENED TO THE CHAIR ONLY ONCE HAD THIS LADY BEEN
BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH SAILORS AND THAT WAS ON HER VOYAGE AND IT
WAS SOMEONE OF HER OWN CLASS OF LIFE SINCE SHE WAS TRYING HARD TO
SHIELD HIM AND SO SHOWING THAT SHE LOVED HIM YOU SEE HOW EASY IT WAS
FOR ME TO LAY MY HANDS UPON YOU WHEN ONCE I HAD STARTED UPON THE
RIGHT TRAIL
I THOUGHT THE POLICE NEVER COULD HAVE SEEN THROUGH OUR DODGE
AND THE POLICE HAVENT NOR WILL THEY TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF
NOW LOOK HERE CAPTAIN CROKER THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER THOUGH
I AM WILLING TO ADMIT THAT YOU ACTED UNDER THE MOST EXTREME
PROVOCATION TO WHICH ANY MAN COULD BE SUBJECTED I AM NOT SURE THAT
IN DEFENCE OF YOUR OWN LIFE YOUR ACTION WILL NOT BE PRONOUNCED
LEGITIMATE HOWEVER THAT IS FOR A BRITISH JURY TO DECIDE MEANWHILE
I HAVE SO MUCH SYMPATHY FOR YOU THAT IF YOU CHOOSE TO DISAPPEAR IN
THE NEXT TWENTYFOUR HOURS I WILL PROMISE YOU THAT NO ONE WILL HINDER
YOU
AND THEN IT WILL ALL COME OUT
CERTAINLY IT WILL COME OUT
THE SAILOR FLUSHED WITH ANGER
WHAT SORT OF PROPOSAL IS THAT TO MAKE A MAN I KNOW ENOUGH OF LAW TO
UNDERSTAND THAT MARY WOULD BE HAD AS ACCOMPLICE DO YOU THINK I WOULD
LEAVE HER ALONE TO FACE THE MUSIC WHILE I SLUNK AWAY NO SIR LET
THEM DO THEIR WORST UPON ME BUT FOR HEAVENS SAKE MR HOLMES FIND
SOME WAY OF KEEPING MY POOR MARY OUT OF THE COURTS
HOLMES FOR A SECOND TIME HELD OUT HIS HAND TO THE SAILOR
I WAS ONLY TESTING YOU AND YOU RING TRUE EVERY TIME WELL IT IS A
GREAT RESPONSIBILITY THAT I TAKE UPON MYSELF BUT I HAVE GIVEN
HOPKINS AN EXCELLENT HINT AND IF HE CANT AVAIL HIMSELF OF IT I CAN
DO NO MORE SEE HERE CAPTAIN CROKER WELL DO THIS IN DUE FORM OF
LAW YOU ARE THE PRISONER WATSON YOU ARE A BRITISH JURY AND I
NEVER MET A MAN WHO WAS MORE EMINENTLY FITTED TO REPRESENT ONE I AM
THE JUDGE NOW GENTLEMAN OF THE JURY YOU HAVE HEARD THE EVIDENCE
DO YOU FIND THE PRISONER GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY
NOT GUILTY MY LORD SAID I
VOX POPULI VOX DEI YOU ARE ACQUITTED CAPTAIN CROKER SO LONG AS
THE LAW DOES NOT FIND SOME OTHER VICTIM YOU ARE SAFE FROM ME COME
BACK TO THIS LADY IN A YEAR AND MAY HER FUTURE AND YOURS JUSTIFY US
IN THE JUDGMENT WHICH WE HAVE PRONOUNCED THIS NIGHT
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN
I HAD INTENDED THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE TO BE THE LAST OF
THOSE EXPLOITS OF MY FRIEND MR SHERLOCK HOLMES WHICH I SHOULD EVER
COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC THIS RESOLUTION OF MINE WAS NOT DUE TO ANY
LACK OF MATERIAL SINCE I HAVE NOTES OF MANY HUNDREDS OF CASES TO
WHICH I HAVE NEVER ALLUDED NOR WAS IT CAUSED BY ANY WANING INTEREST
ON THE PART OF MY READERS IN THE SINGULAR PERSONALITY AND UNIQUE
METHODS OF THIS REMARKABLE MAN THE REAL REASON LAY IN THE RELUCTANCE
WHICH MR HOLMES HAS SHOWN TO THE CONTINUED PUBLICATION OF HIS
EXPERIENCES SO LONG AS HE WAS IN ACTUAL PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE THE
RECORDS OF HIS SUCCESSES WERE OF SOME PRACTICAL VALUE TO HIM BUT
SINCE HE HAS DEFINITELY RETIRED FROM LONDON AND BETAKEN HIMSELF TO
STUDY AND BEEFARMING ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS NOTORIETY HAS BECOME
HATEFUL TO HIM AND HE HAS PEREMPTORILY REQUESTED THAT HIS WISHES IN
THIS MATTER SHOULD BE STRICTLY OBSERVED IT WAS ONLY UPON MY
REPRESENTING TO HIM THAT I HAD GIVEN A PROMISE THAT THE ADVENTURE OF
THE SECOND STAIN SHOULD BE PUBLISHED WHEN THE TIMES WERE RIPE AND
POINTING OUT TO HIM THAT IT IS ONLY APPROPRIATE THAT THIS LONG SERIES
OF EPISODES SHOULD CULMINATE IN THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL CASE
WHICH HE HAS EVER BEEN CALLED UPON TO HANDLE THAT I AT LAST
SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING HIS CONSENT THAT A CAREFULLYGUARDED ACCOUNT
OF THE INCIDENT SHOULD AT LAST BE LAID BEFORE THE PUBLIC IF IN
TELLING THE STORY I SEEM TO BE SOMEWHAT VAGUE IN CERTAIN DETAILS THE
PUBLIC WILL READILY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS AN EXCELLENT REASON FOR
MY RETICENCE
IT WAS THEN IN A YEAR AND EVEN IN A DECADE THAT SHALL BE
NAMELESS THAT UPON ONE TUESDAY MORNING IN AUTUMN WE FOUND TWO
VISITORS OF EUROPEAN FAME WITHIN THE WALLS OF OUR HUMBLE ROOM IN
BAKER STREET THE ONE AUSTERE HIGHNOSED EAGLEEYED AND DOMINANT
WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE ILLUSTRIOUS LORD BELLINGER TWICE PREMIER OF
BRITAIN THE OTHER DARK CLEARCUT AND ELEGANT HARDLY YET OF
MIDDLE AGE AND ENDOWED WITH EVERY BEAUTY OF BODY AND OF MIND WAS
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE TRELAWNEY HOPE SECRETARY FOR EUROPEAN AFFAIRS
AND THE MOST RISING STATESMAN IN THE COUNTRY THEY SAT SIDE BY SIDE
UPON OUR PAPERLITTERED SETTEE AND IT WAS EASY TO SEE FROM THEIR
WORN AND ANXIOUS FACES THAT IT WAS BUSINESS OF THE MOST PRESSING
IMPORTANCE WHICH HAD BROUGHT THEM THE PREMIERS THIN BLUEVEINED
HANDS WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY OVER THE IVORY HEAD OF HIS UMBRELLA AND
HIS GAUNT ASCETIC FACE LOOKED GLOOMILY FROM HOLMES TO ME THE
EUROPEAN SECRETARY PULLED NERVOUSLY AT HIS MOUSTACHE AND FIDGETED
WITH THE SEALS OF HIS WATCHCHAIN
WHEN I DISCOVERED MY LOSS MR HOLMES WHICH WAS AT EIGHT OCLOCK
THIS MORNING I AT ONCE INFORMED THE PRIME MINISTER IT WAS AT HIS
SUGGESTION THAT WE HAVE BOTH COME TO YOU
HAVE YOU INFORMED THE POLICE
NO SIR SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH THE QUICK DECISIVE MANNER
FOR WHICH HE WAS FAMOUS WE HAVE NOT DONE SO NOR IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT WE SHOULD DO SO TO INFORM THE POLICE MUST IN THE LONG RUN
MEAN TO INFORM THE PUBLIC THIS IS WHAT WE PARTICULARLY DESIRE TO
AVOID
AND WHY SIR
BECAUSE THE DOCUMENT IN QUESTION IS OF SUCH IMMENSE IMPORTANCE THAT
ITS PUBLICATION MIGHT VERY EASILYI MIGHT ALMOST SAY PROBABLYLEAD
TO EUROPEAN COMPLICATIONS OF THE UTMOST MOMENT IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO
SAY THAT PEACE OR WAR MAY HANG UPON THE ISSUE UNLESS ITS RECOVERY
CAN BE ATTENDED WITH THE UTMOST SECRECY THEN IT MAY AS WELL NOT BE
RECOVERED AT ALL FOR ALL THAT IS AIMED AT BY THOSE WHO HAVE TAKEN IT
IS THAT ITS CONTENTS SHOULD BE GENERALLY KNOWN
I UNDERSTAND NOW MR TRELAWNEY HOPE I SHOULD BE MUCH OBLIGED IF
YOU WOULD TELL ME EXACTLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THIS DOCUMENT
DISAPPEARED
THAT CAN BE DONE IN A VERY FEW WORDS MR HOLMES THE LETTERFOR IT
WAS A LETTER FROM A FOREIGN POTENTATEWAS RECEIVED SIX DAYS AGO IT
WAS OF SUCH IMPORTANCE THAT I HAVE NEVER LEFT IT IN MY SAFE BUT I
HAVE TAKEN IT ACROSS EACH EVENING TO MY HOUSE IN WHITEHALL TERRACE
AND KEPT IT IN MY BEDROOM IN A LOCKED DESPATCHBOX IT WAS THERE LAST
NIGHT OF THAT I AM CERTAIN I ACTUALLY OPENED THE BOX WHILE I WAS
DRESSING FOR DINNER AND SAW THE DOCUMENT INSIDE THIS MORNING IT WAS
GONE THE DESPATCHBOX HAD STOOD BESIDE THE GLASS UPON MY
DRESSINGTABLE ALL NIGHT I AM A LIGHT SLEEPER AND SO IS MY WIFE WE
ARE BOTH PREPARED TO SWEAR THAT NO ONE COULD HAVE ENTERED THE ROOM
DURING THE NIGHT AND YET I REPEAT THAT THE PAPER IS GONE
WHAT TIME DID YOU DINE
HALFPAST SEVEN
HOW LONG WAS IT BEFORE YOU WENT TO BED
MY WIFE HAD GONE TO THE THEATRE I WAITED UP FOR HER IT WAS
HALFPAST ELEVEN BEFORE WE WENT TO OUR ROOM
THEN FOR FOUR HOURS THE DESPATCHBOX HAD LAIN UNGUARDED
NO ONE IS EVER PERMITTED TO ENTER THAT ROOM SAVE THE HOUSEMAID IN
THE MORNING AND MY VALET OR MY WIFES MAID DURING THE REST OF THE
DAY THEY ARE BOTH TRUSTY SERVANTS WHO HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR SOME
TIME BESIDES NEITHER OF THEM COULD POSSIBLY HAVE KNOWN THAT THERE
WAS ANYTHING MORE VALUABLE THAN THE ORDINARY DEPARTMENTAL PAPERS IN
MY DESPATCHBOX
WHO DID KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THAT LETTER
NO ONE IN THE HOUSE
SURELY YOUR WIFE KNEW
NO SIR I HAD SAID NOTHING TO MY WIFE UNTIL I MISSED THE PAPER THIS
MORNING
THE PREMIER NODDED APPROVINGLY
I HAVE LONG KNOWN SIR HOW HIGH IS YOUR SENSE OF PUBLIC DUTY SAID
HE I AM CONVINCED THAT IN THE CASE OF A SECRET OF THIS IMPORTANCE
IT WOULD RISE SUPERIOR TO THE MOST INTIMATE DOMESTIC TIES
THE EUROPEAN SECRETARY BOWED
YOU DO ME NO MORE THAN JUSTICE SIR UNTIL THIS MORNING I HAVE NEVER
BREATHED ONE WORD TO MY WIFE UPON THIS MATTER
COULD SHE HAVE GUESSED
NO MR HOLMES SHE COULD NOT HAVE GUESSEDNOR COULD ANYONE HAVE
GUESSED
HAVE YOU LOST ANY DOCUMENTS BEFORE
NO SIR
WHO IS THERE IN ENGLAND WHO DID KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS
LETTER
EACH MEMBER OF THE CABINET WAS INFORMED OF IT YESTERDAY BUT THE
PLEDGE OF SECRECY WHICH ATTENDS EVERY CABINET MEETING WAS INCREASED
BY THE SOLEMN WARNING WHICH WAS GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER GOOD
HEAVENS TO THINK THAT WITHIN A FEW HOURS I SHOULD MYSELF HAVE LOST
IT HIS HANDSOME FACE WAS DISTORTED WITH A SPASM OF DESPAIR AND HIS
HANDS TORE AT HIS HAIR FOR A MOMENT WE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE
NATURAL MAN IMPULSIVE ARDENT KEENLY SENSITIVE THE NEXT THE
ARISTOCRATIC MASK WAS REPLACED AND THE GENTLE VOICE HAD RETURNED
BESIDES THE MEMBERS OF THE CABINET THERE ARE TWO OR POSSIBLY THREE
DEPARTMENTAL OFFICIALS WHO KNOW OF THE LETTER NO ONE ELSE IN
ENGLAND MR HOLMES I ASSURE YOU
BUT ABROAD
I BELIEVE THAT NO ONE ABROAD HAS SEEN IT SAVE THE MAN WHO WROTE IT
I AM WELL CONVINCED THAT HIS MINISTERSTHAT THE USUAL OFFICIAL
CHANNELS HAVE NOT BEEN EMPLOYED
HOLMES CONSIDERED FOR SOME LITTLE TIME
NOW SIR I MUST ASK YOU MORE PARTICULARLY WHAT THIS DOCUMENT IS
AND WHY ITS DISAPPEARANCE SHOULD HAVE SUCH MOMENTOUS CONSEQUENCES
THE TWO STATESMEN EXCHANGED A QUICK GLANCE AND THE PREMIERS SHAGGY
EYEBROWS GATHERED IN A FROWN
MR HOLMES THE ENVELOPE IS A LONG THIN ONE OF PALE BLUE COLOUR
THERE IS A SEAL OF RED WAX STAMPED WITH A CROUCHING LION IT IS
ADDRESSED IN LARGE BOLD HANDWRITING TO
I FEAR SIR SAID HOLMES THAT INTERESTING AND INDEED ESSENTIAL
AS THESE DETAILS ARE MY INQUIRIES MUST GO MORE TO THE ROOT OF
THINGS WHAT WAS THE LETTER
THAT IS A STATE SECRET OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND I FEAR THAT I
CANNOT TELL YOU NOR DO I SEE THAT IT IS NECESSARY IF BY THE AID OF
THE POWERS WHICH YOU ARE SAID TO POSSESS YOU CAN FIND SUCH AN
ENVELOPE AS I DESCRIBE WITH ITS ENCLOSURE YOU WILL HAVE DESERVED
WELL OF YOUR COUNTRY AND EARNED ANY REWARD WHICH IT LIES IN OUR
POWER TO BESTOW
SHERLOCK HOLMES ROSE WITH A SMILE
YOU ARE TWO OF THE MOST BUSY MEN IN THE COUNTRY SAID HE AND IN
MY OWN SMALL WAY I HAVE ALSO A GOOD MANY CALLS UPON ME I REGRET
EXCEEDINGLY THAT I CANNOT HELP YOU IN THIS MATTER AND ANY
CONTINUATION OF THIS INTERVIEW WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME
THE PREMIER SPRANG TO HIS FEET WITH THAT QUICK FIERCE GLEAM OF HIS
DEEPSET EYES BEFORE WHICH A CABINET HAS COWERED I AM NOT
ACCUSTOMED SIR HE BEGAN BUT MASTERED HIS ANGER AND RESUMED HIS
SEAT FOR A MINUTE OR MORE WE ALL SAT IN SILENCE THEN THE OLD
STATESMAN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
WE MUST ACCEPT YOUR TERMS MR HOLMES NO DOUBT YOU ARE RIGHT AND
IT IS UNREASONABLE FOR US TO EXPECT YOU TO ACT UNLESS WE GIVE YOU OUR
ENTIRE CONFIDENCE
I AGREE WITH YOU SIR SAID THE YOUNGER STATESMAN
THEN I WILL TELL YOU RELYING ENTIRELY UPON YOUR HONOUR AND THAT OF
YOUR COLLEAGUE DR WATSON I MAY APPEAL TO YOUR PATRIOTISM ALSO FOR
I COULD NOT IMAGINE A GREATER MISFORTUNE FOR THE COUNTRY THAN THAT
THIS AFFAIR SHOULD COME OUT
YOU MAY SAFELY TRUST US
THE LETTER THEN IS FROM A CERTAIN FOREIGN POTENTATE WHO HAS BEEN
RUFFLED BY SOME RECENT COLONIAL DEVELOPMENTS OF THIS COUNTRY IT HAS
BEEN WRITTEN HURRIEDLY AND UPON HIS OWN RESPONSIBILITY ENTIRELY
INQUIRIES HAVE SHOWN THAT HIS MINISTERS KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER
AT THE SAME TIME IT IS COUCHED IN SO UNFORTUNATE A MANNER AND
CERTAIN PHRASES IN IT ARE OF SO PROVOCATIVE A CHARACTER THAT ITS
PUBLICATION WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY LEAD TO A MOST DANGEROUS STATE OF
FEELING IN THIS COUNTRY THERE WOULD BE SUCH A FERMENT SIR THAT I
DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT WITHIN A WEEK OF THE PUBLICATION OF THAT
LETTER THIS COUNTRY WOULD BE INVOLVED IN A GREAT WAR
HOLMES WROTE A NAME UPON A SLIP OF PAPER AND HANDED IT TO THE
PREMIER
EXACTLY IT WAS HE AND IT IS THIS LETTERTHIS LETTER WHICH MAY
WELL MEAN THE EXPENDITURE OF A THOUSAND MILLIONS AND THE LIVES OF A
HUNDRED THOUSAND MENWHICH HAS BECOME LOST IN THIS UNACCOUNTABLE
FASHION
HAVE YOU INFORMED THE SENDER
YES SIR A CIPHER TELEGRAM HAS BEEN DESPATCHED
PERHAPS HE DESIRES THE PUBLICATION OF THE LETTER
NO SIR WE HAVE STRONG REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE ALREADY
UNDERSTANDS THAT HE HAS ACTED IN AN INDISCREET AND HOTHEADED MANNER
IT WOULD BE A GREATER BLOW TO HIM AND TO HIS COUNTRY THAN TO US IF
THIS LETTER WERE TO COME OUT
IF THIS IS SO WHOSE INTEREST IS IT THAT THE LETTER SHOULD COME OUT
WHY SHOULD ANYONE DESIRE TO STEAL IT OR TO PUBLISH IT
THERE MR HOLMES YOU TAKE ME INTO REGIONS OF HIGH INTERNATIONAL
POLITICS BUT IF YOU CONSIDER THE EUROPEAN SITUATION YOU WILL HAVE NO
DIFFICULTY IN PERCEIVING THE MOTIVE THE WHOLE OF EUROPE IS AN ARMED
CAMP THERE IS A DOUBLE LEAGUE WHICH MAKES A FAIR BALANCE OF MILITARY
POWER GREAT BRITAIN HOLDS THE SCALES IF BRITAIN WERE DRIVEN INTO
WAR WITH ONE CONFEDERACY IT WOULD ASSURE THE SUPREMACY OF THE OTHER
CONFEDERACY WHETHER THEY JOINED IN THE WAR OR NOT DO YOU FOLLOW
VERY CLEARLY IT IS THEN THE INTEREST OF THE ENEMIES OF THIS
POTENTATE TO SECURE AND PUBLISH THIS LETTER SO AS TO MAKE A BREACH
BETWEEN HIS COUNTRY AND OURS
YES SIR
AND TO WHOM WOULD THIS DOCUMENT BE SENT IF IT FELL INTO THE HANDS OF
AN ENEMY
TO ANY OF THE GREAT CHANCELLERIES OF EUROPE IT IS PROBABLY SPEEDING
ON ITS WAY THITHER AT THE PRESENT INSTANT AS FAST AS STEAM CAN TAKE
IT
MR TRELAWNEY HOPE DROPPED HIS HEAD ON HIS CHEST AND GROANED ALOUD
THE PREMIER PLACED HIS HAND KINDLY UPON HIS SHOULDER
IT IS YOUR MISFORTUNE MY DEAR FELLOW NO ONE CAN BLAME YOU THERE
IS NO PRECAUTION WHICH YOU HAVE NEGLECTED NOW MR HOLMES YOU ARE
IN FULL POSSESSION OF THE FACTS WHAT COURSE DO YOU RECOMMEND
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY
YOU THINK SIR THAT UNLESS THIS DOCUMENT IS RECOVERED THERE WILL BE
WAR
I THINK IT IS VERY PROBABLE
THEN SIR PREPARE FOR WAR
THAT IS A HARD SAYING MR HOLMES
CONSIDER THE FACTS SIR IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT IT WAS TAKEN AFTER
ELEVENTHIRTY AT NIGHT SINCE I UNDERSTAND THAT MR HOPE AND HIS WIFE
WERE BOTH IN THE ROOM FROM THAT HOUR UNTIL THE LOSS WAS FOUND OUT IT
WAS TAKEN THEN YESTERDAY EVENING BETWEEN SEVENTHIRTY AND
ELEVENTHIRTY PROBABLY NEAR THE EARLIER HOUR SINCE WHOEVER TOOK IT
EVIDENTLY KNEW THAT IT WAS THERE AND WOULD NATURALLY SECURE IT AS
EARLY AS POSSIBLE NOW SIR IF A DOCUMENT OF THIS IMPORTANCE WERE
TAKEN AT THAT HOUR WHERE CAN IT BE NOW NO ONE HAS ANY REASON TO
RETAIN IT IT HAS BEEN PASSED RAPIDLY ON TO THOSE WHO NEED IT WHAT
CHANCE HAVE WE NOW TO OVERTAKE OR EVEN TO TRACE IT IT IS BEYOND OUR
REACH
THE PRIME MINISTER ROSE FROM THE SETTEE
WHAT YOU SAY IS PERFECTLY LOGICAL MR HOLMES I FEEL THAT THE
MATTER IS INDEED OUT OF OUR HANDS
LET US PRESUME FOR ARGUMENTS SAKE THAT THE DOCUMENT WAS TAKEN BY
THE MAID OR BY THE VALET
THEY ARE BOTH OLD AND TRIED SERVANTS
I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT YOUR ROOM IS ON THE SECOND FLOOR THAT
THERE IS NO ENTRANCE FROM WITHOUT AND THAT FROM WITHIN NO ONE COULD
GO UP UNOBSERVED IT MUST THEN BE SOMEBODY IN THE HOUSE WHO HAS
TAKEN IT TO WHOM WOULD THE THIEF TAKE IT TO ONE OF SEVERAL
INTERNATIONAL SPIES AND SECRET AGENTS WHOSE NAMES ARE TOLERABLY
FAMILIAR TO ME THERE ARE THREE WHO MAY BE SAID TO BE THE HEADS OF
THEIR PROFESSION I WILL BEGIN MY RESEARCH BY GOING ROUND AND FINDING
IF EACH OF THEM IS AT HIS POST IF ONE IS MISSINGESPECIALLY IF HE
HAS DISAPPEARED SINCE LAST NIGHTWE WILL HAVE SOME INDICATION AS TO
WHERE THE DOCUMENT HAS GONE
WHY SHOULD HE BE MISSING ASKED THE EUROPEAN SECRETARY HE WOULD
TAKE THE LETTER TO AN EMBASSY IN LONDON AS LIKELY AS NOT
I FANCY NOT THESE AGENTS WORK INDEPENDENTLY AND THEIR RELATIONS
WITH THE EMBASSIES ARE OFTEN STRAINED
THE PRIME MINISTER NODDED HIS ACQUIESCENCE
I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT MR HOLMES HE WOULD TAKE SO VALUABLE A
PRIZE TO HEADQUARTERS WITH HIS OWN HANDS I THINK THAT YOUR COURSE
OF ACTION IS AN EXCELLENT ONE MEANWHILE HOPE WE CANNOT NEGLECT ALL
OUR OTHER DUTIES ON ACCOUNT OF THIS ONE MISFORTUNE SHOULD THERE BE
ANY FRESH DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE DAY WE SHALL COMMUNICATE WITH YOU
AND YOU WILL NO DOUBT LET US KNOW THE RESULTS OF YOUR OWN INQUIRIES
THE TWO STATESMEN BOWED AND WALKED GRAVELY FROM THE ROOM
WHEN OUR ILLUSTRIOUS VISITORS HAD DEPARTED HOLMES LIT HIS PIPE IN
SILENCE AND SAT FOR SOME TIME LOST IN THE DEEPEST THOUGHT I HAD
OPENED THE MORNING PAPER AND WAS IMMERSED IN A SENSATIONAL CRIME
WHICH HAD OCCURRED IN LONDON THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN MY FRIEND GAVE AN
EXCLAMATION SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND LAID HIS PIPE DOWN UPON THE
MANTELPIECE
YES SAID HE THERE IS NO BETTER WAY OF APPROACHING IT THE
SITUATION IS DESPERATE BUT NOT HOPELESS EVEN NOW IF WE COULD BE
SURE WHICH OF THEM HAS TAKEN IT IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT IT HAS NOT
YET PASSED OUT OF HIS HANDS AFTER ALL IT IS A QUESTION OF MONEY
WITH THESE FELLOWS AND I HAVE THE BRITISH TREASURY BEHIND ME IF
ITS ON THE MARKET ILL BUY ITIF IT MEANS ANOTHER PENNY ON THE
INCOMETAX IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT THE FELLOW MIGHT HOLD IT BACK TO
SEE WHAT BIDS COME FROM THIS SIDE BEFORE HE TRIES HIS LUCK ON THE
OTHER THERE ARE ONLY THOSE THREE CAPABLE OF PLAYING SO BOLD A GAME
THERE ARE OBERSTEIN LA ROTHIERE AND EDUARDO LUCAS I WILL SEE EACH
OF THEM
I GLANCED AT MY MORNING PAPER
IS THAT EDUARDO LUCAS OF GODOLPHIN STREET
YES
YOU WILL NOT SEE HIM
WHY NOT
HE WAS MURDERED IN HIS HOUSE LAST NIGHT
MY FRIEND HAS SO OFTEN ASTONISHED ME IN THE COURSE OF OUR ADVENTURES
THAT IT WAS WITH A SENSE OF EXULTATION THAT I REALIZED HOW COMPLETELY
I HAD ASTONISHED HIM HE STARED IN AMAZEMENT AND THEN SNATCHED THE
PAPER FROM MY HANDS THIS WAS THE PARAGRAPH WHICH I HAD BEEN ENGAGED
IN READING WHEN HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR
MURDER IN WESTMINSTER
A CRIME OF MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER WAS COMMITTED LAST NIGHT AT GODOLPHIN
STREET ONE OF THE OLDFASHIONED AND SECLUDED ROWS OF
EIGHTEENTHCENTURY HOUSES WHICH LIE BETWEEN THE RIVER AND THE ABBEY
ALMOST IN THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT TOWER OF THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT
THIS SMALL BUT SELECT MANSION HAS BEEN INHABITED FOR SOME YEARS BY
MR EDUARDO LUCAS WELL KNOWN IN SOCIETY CIRCLES BOTH ON ACCOUNT OF
HIS CHARMING PERSONALITY AND BECAUSE HE HAS THE WELLDESERVED
REPUTATION OF BEING ONE OF THE BEST AMATEUR TENORS IN THE COUNTRY
MR LUCAS IS AN UNMARRIED MAN THIRTYFOUR YEARS OF AGE AND HIS
ESTABLISHMENT CONSISTS OF MRS PRINGLE AN ELDERLY HOUSEKEEPER AND
OF MITTON HIS VALET THE FORMER RETIRES EARLY AND SLEEPS AT THE TOP
OF THE HOUSE THE VALET WAS OUT FOR THE EVENING VISITING A FRIEND AT
HAMMERSMITH FROM TEN OCLOCK ONWARDS MR LUCAS HAD THE HOUSE TO
HIMSELF WHAT OCCURRED DURING THAT TIME HAS NOT YET TRANSPIRED BUT
AT A QUARTER TO TWELVE POLICECONSTABLE BARRETT PASSING ALONG
GODOLPHIN STREET OBSERVED THAT THE DOOR OF NO WAS AJAR HE
KNOCKED BUT RECEIVED NO ANSWER PERCEIVING A LIGHT IN THE FRONT ROOM
HE ADVANCED INTO THE PASSAGE AND AGAIN KNOCKED BUT WITHOUT REPLY HE
THEN PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND ENTERED THE ROOM WAS IN A STATE OF
WILD DISORDER THE FURNITURE BEING ALL SWEPT TO ONE SIDE AND ONE
CHAIR LYING ON ITS BACK IN THE CENTRE BESIDE THIS CHAIR AND STILL
GRASPING ONE OF ITS LEGS LAY THE UNFORTUNATE TENANT OF THE HOUSE HE
HAD BEEN STABBED TO THE HEART AND MUST HAVE DIED INSTANTLY THE KNIFE
WITH WHICH THE CRIME HAD BEEN COMMITTED WAS A CURVED INDIAN DAGGER
PLUCKED DOWN FROM A TROPHY OF ORIENTAL ARMS WHICH ADORNED ONE OF THE
WALLS ROBBERY DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN THE MOTIVE OF THE CRIME
FOR THERE HAD BEEN NO ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE VALUABLE CONTENTS OF THE
ROOM MR EDUARDO LUCAS WAS SO WELL KNOWN AND POPULAR THAT HIS
VIOLENT AND MYSTERIOUS FATE WILL AROUSE PAINFUL INTEREST AND INTENSE
SYMPATHY IN A WIDESPREAD CIRCLE OF FRIENDS
WELL WATSON WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS ASKED HOLMES AFTER A LONG
PAUSE
IT IS AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE
A COINCIDENCE HERE IS ONE OF THE THREE MEN WHOM WE HAD NAMED AS
POSSIBLE ACTORS IN THIS DRAMA AND HE MEETS A VIOLENT DEATH DURING
THE VERY HOURS WHEN WE KNOW THAT THAT DRAMA WAS BEING ENACTED THE
ODDS ARE ENORMOUS AGAINST ITS BEING COINCIDENCE NO FIGURES COULD
EXPRESS THEM NO MY DEAR WATSON THE TWO EVENTS ARE CONNECTEDMUST
BE CONNECTED IT IS FOR US TO FIND THE CONNECTION
BUT NOW THE OFFICIAL POLICE MUST KNOW ALL
NOT AT ALL THEY KNOW ALL THEY SEE AT GODOLPHIN STREET THEY
KNOWAND SHALL KNOWNOTHING OF WHITEHALL TERRACE ONLY WE KNOW OF
BOTH EVENTS AND CAN TRACE THE RELATION BETWEEN THEM THERE IS ONE
OBVIOUS POINT WHICH WOULD IN ANY CASE HAVE TURNED MY SUSPICIONS
AGAINST LUCAS GODOLPHIN STREET WESTMINSTER IS ONLY A FEW MINUTES
WALK FROM WHITEHALL TERRACE THE OTHER SECRET AGENTS WHOM I HAVE
NAMED LIVE IN THE EXTREME WESTEND IT WAS EASIER THEREFORE FOR
LUCAS THAN FOR THE OTHERS TO ESTABLISH A CONNECTION OR RECEIVE A
MESSAGE FROM THE EUROPEAN SECRETARYS HOUSEHOLDA SMALL THING AND
YET WHERE EVENTS ARE COMPRESSED INTO A FEW HOURS IT MAY PROVE
ESSENTIAL HALLOA WHAT HAVE WE HERE
MRS HUDSON HAD APPEARED WITH A LADYS CARD UPON HER SALVER HOLMES
GLANCED AT IT RAISED HIS EYEBROWS AND HANDED IT OVER TO ME
ASK LADY HILDA TRELAWNEY HOPE IF SHE WILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO STEP
UP SAID HE
A MOMENT LATER OUR MODEST APARTMENT ALREADY SO DISTINGUISHED THAT
MORNING WAS FURTHER HONOURED BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE MOST LOVELY
WOMAN IN LONDON I HAD OFTEN HEARD OF THE BEAUTY OF THE YOUNGEST
DAUGHTER OF THE DUKE OF BELMINSTER BUT NO DESCRIPTION OF IT AND NO
CONTEMPLATION OF COLOURLESS PHOTOGRAPHS HAD PREPARED ME FOR THE
SUBTLE DELICATE CHARM AND THE BEAUTIFUL COLOURING OF THAT EXQUISITE
HEAD AND YET AS WE SAW IT THAT AUTUMN MORNING IT WAS NOT ITS BEAUTY
WHICH WOULD BE THE FIRST THING TO IMPRESS THE OBSERVER THE CHEEK WAS
LOVELY BUT IT WAS PALED WITH EMOTION THE EYES WERE BRIGHT BUT IT
WAS THE BRIGHTNESS OF FEVER THE SENSITIVE MOUTH WAS TIGHT AND DRAWN
IN AN EFFORT AFTER SELFCOMMAND TERRORNOT BEAUTYWAS WHAT SPRANG
FIRST TO THE EYE AS OUR FAIR VISITOR STOOD FRAMED FOR AN INSTANT IN
THE OPEN DOOR
HAS MY HUSBAND BEEN HERE MR HOLMES
YES MADAM HE HAS BEEN HERE
MR HOLMES I IMPLORE YOU NOT TO TELL HIM THAT I CAME HERE HOLMES
BOWED COLDLY AND MOTIONED THE LADY TO A CHAIR
YOUR LADYSHIP PLACES ME IN A VERY DELICATE POSITION I BEG THAT YOU
WILL SIT DOWN AND TELL ME WHAT YOU DESIRE BUT I FEAR THAT I CANNOT
MAKE ANY UNCONDITIONAL PROMISE
SHE SWEPT ACROSS THE ROOM AND SEATED HERSELF WITH HER BACK TO THE
WINDOW IT WAS A QUEENLY PRESENCETALL GRACEFUL AND INTENSELY
WOMANLY
MR HOLMES SHE SAID AND HER WHITEGLOVED HANDS CLASPED AND
UNCLASPED AS SHE SPOKEI WILL SPEAK FRANKLY TO YOU IN THE HOPE THAT
IT MAY INDUCE YOU TO SPEAK FRANKLY IN RETURN THERE IS COMPLETE
CONFIDENCE BETWEEN MY HUSBAND AND ME ON ALL MATTERS SAVE ONE THAT
ONE IS POLITICS ON THIS HIS LIPS ARE SEALED HE TELLS ME NOTHING
NOW I AM AWARE THAT THERE WAS A MOST DEPLORABLE OCCURRENCE IN OUR
HOUSE LAST NIGHT I KNOW THAT A PAPER HAS DISAPPEARED BUT BECAUSE
THE MATTER IS POLITICAL MY HUSBAND REFUSES TO TAKE ME INTO HIS
COMPLETE CONFIDENCE NOW IT IS ESSENTIALESSENTIAL I SAYTHAT I
SHOULD THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND IT YOU ARE THE ONLY OTHER PERSON SAVE
ONLY THESE POLITICIANS WHO KNOWS THE TRUE FACTS I BEG YOU THEN
MR HOLMES TO TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHAT IT WILL
LEAD TO TELL ME ALL MR HOLMES LET NO REGARD FOR YOUR CLIENTS
INTERESTS KEEP YOU SILENT FOR I ASSURE YOU THAT HIS INTERESTS IF HE
WOULD ONLY SEE IT WOULD BE BEST SERVED BY TAKING ME INTO HIS
COMPLETE CONFIDENCE WHAT WAS THIS PAPER WHICH WAS STOLEN
MADAM WHAT YOU ASK ME IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE
SHE GROANED AND SANK HER FACE IN HER HANDS
YOU MUST SEE THAT THIS IS SO MADAM IF YOUR HUSBAND THINKS FIT TO
KEEP YOU IN THE DARK OVER THIS MATTER IS IT FOR ME WHO HAS ONLY
LEARNED THE TRUE FACTS UNDER THE PLEDGE OF PROFESSIONAL SECRECY TO
TELL WHAT HE HAS WITHHELD IT IS NOT FAIR TO ASK IT IT IS HIM WHOM
YOU MUST ASK
I HAVE ASKED HIM I COME TO YOU AS A LAST RESOURCE BUT WITHOUT YOUR
TELLING ME ANYTHING DEFINITE MR HOLMES YOU MAY DO A GREAT SERVICE
IF YOU WOULD ENLIGHTEN ME ON ONE POINT
WHAT IS IT MADAM
IS MY HUSBANDS POLITICAL CAREER LIKELY TO SUFFER THROUGH THIS
INCIDENT
WELL MADAM UNLESS IT IS SET RIGHT IT MAY CERTAINLY HAVE A VERY
UNFORTUNATE EFFECT
AH SHE DREW IN HER BREATH SHARPLY AS ONE WHOSE DOUBTS ARE
RESOLVED
ONE MORE QUESTION MR HOLMES FROM AN EXPRESSION WHICH MY HUSBAND
DROPPED IN THE FIRST SHOCK OF THIS DISASTER I UNDERSTOOD THAT
TERRIBLE PUBLIC CONSEQUENCES MIGHT ARISE FROM THE LOSS OF THIS
DOCUMENT
IF HE SAID SO I CERTAINLY CANNOT DENY IT
OF WHAT NATURE ARE THEY
NAY MADAM THERE AGAIN YOU ASK ME MORE THAN I CAN POSSIBLY ANSWER
THEN I WILL TAKE UP NO MORE OF YOUR TIME I CANNOT BLAME YOU MR
HOLMES FOR HAVING REFUSED TO SPEAK MORE FREELY AND YOU ON YOUR SIDE
WILL NOT I AM SURE THINK THE WORSE OF ME BECAUSE I DESIRE EVEN
AGAINST HIS WILL TO SHARE MY HUSBANDS ANXIETIES ONCE MORE I BEG
THAT YOU WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY VISIT SHE LOOKED BACK AT US FROM
THE DOOR AND I HAD A LAST IMPRESSION OF THAT BEAUTIFUL HAUNTED FACE
THE STARTLED EYES AND THE DRAWN MOUTH THEN SHE WAS GONE
NOW WATSON THE FAIR SEX IS YOUR DEPARTMENT SAID HOLMES WITH A
SMILE WHEN THE DWINDLING FROUFROU OF SKIRTS HAD ENDED IN THE SLAM
OF THE FRONT DOOR WHAT WAS THE FAIR LADYS GAME WHAT DID SHE
REALLY WANT
SURELY HER OWN STATEMENT IS CLEAR AND HER ANXIETY VERY NATURAL
HUM THINK OF HER APPEARANCE WATSONHER MANNER HER SUPPRESSED
EXCITEMENT HER RESTLESSNESS HER TENACITY IN ASKING QUESTIONS
REMEMBER THAT SHE COMES OF A CASTE WHO DO NOT LIGHTLY SHOW EMOTION
SHE WAS CERTAINLY MUCH MOVED
REMEMBER ALSO THE CURIOUS EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH SHE ASSURED US THAT
IT WAS BEST FOR HER HUSBAND THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW ALL WHAT DID SHE
MEAN BY THAT AND YOU MUST HAVE OBSERVED WATSON HOW SHE MANOEUVRED
TO HAVE THE LIGHT AT HER BACK SHE DID NOT WISH US TO READ HER
EXPRESSION
YES SHE CHOSE THE ONE CHAIR IN THE ROOM
AND YET THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ARE SO INSCRUTABLE YOU REMEMBER THE
WOMAN AT MARGATE WHOM I SUSPECTED FOR THE SAME REASON NO POWDER ON
HER NOSETHAT PROVED TO BE THE CORRECT SOLUTION HOW CAN YOU BUILD
ON SUCH A QUICKSAND THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTION MAY MEAN VOLUMES OR
THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A
CURLINGTONGS GOOD MORNING WATSON
YOU ARE OFF
YES I WILL WILE AWAY THE MORNING AT GODOLPHIN STREET WITH OUR
FRIENDS OF THE REGULAR ESTABLISHMENT WITH EDUARDO LUCAS LIES THE
SOLUTION OF OUR PROBLEM THOUGH I MUST ADMIT THAT I HAVE NOT AN
INKLING AS TO WHAT FORM IT MAY TAKE IT IS A CAPITAL MISTAKE TO
THEORIZE IN ADVANCE OF THE FACTS DO YOU STAY ON GUARD MY GOOD
WATSON AND RECEIVE ANY FRESH VISITORS ILL JOIN YOU AT LUNCH IF I
AM ABLE
ALL THAT DAY AND THE NEXT AND THE NEXT HOLMES WAS IN A MOOD WHICH HIS
FRIENDS WOULD CALL TACITURN AND OTHERS MOROSE HE RAN OUT AND RAN
IN SMOKED INCESSANTLY PLAYED SNATCHES ON HIS VIOLIN SANK INTO
REVERIES DEVOURED SANDWICHES AT IRREGULAR HOURS AND HARDLY ANSWERED
THE CASUAL QUESTIONS WHICH I PUT TO HIM IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT
THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL WITH HIM OR HIS QUEST HE WOULD SAY
NOTHING OF THE CASE AND IT WAS FROM THE PAPERS THAT I LEARNED THE
PARTICULARS OF THE INQUEST AND THE ARREST WITH THE SUBSEQUENT
RELEASE OF JOHN MITTON THE VALET OF THE DECEASED THE CORONERS JURY
BROUGHT IN THE OBVIOUS WILFUL MURDER BUT THE PARTIES REMAINED AS
UNKNOWN AS EVER NO MOTIVE WAS SUGGESTED THE ROOM WAS FULL OF
ARTICLES OF VALUE BUT NONE HAD BEEN TAKEN THE DEAD MANS PAPERS HAD
NOT BEEN TAMPERED WITH THEY WERE CAREFULLY EXAMINED AND SHOWED THAT
HE WAS A KEEN STUDENT OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS AN INDEFATIGABLE
GOSSIP A REMARKABLE LINGUIST AND AN UNTIRING LETTERWRITER HE HAD
BEEN ON INTIMATE TERMS WITH THE LEADING POLITICIANS OF SEVERAL
COUNTRIES BUT NOTHING SENSATIONAL WAS DISCOVERED AMONG THE DOCUMENTS
WHICH FILLED HIS DRAWERS AS TO HIS RELATIONS WITH WOMEN THEY
APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN PROMISCUOUS BUT SUPERFICIAL HE HAD MANY
ACQUAINTANCES AMONG THEM BUT FEW FRIENDS AND NO ONE WHOM HE LOVED
HIS HABITS WERE REGULAR HIS CONDUCT INOFFENSIVE HIS DEATH WAS AN
ABSOLUTE MYSTERY AND LIKELY TO REMAIN SO
AS TO THE ARREST OF JOHN MITTON THE VALET IT WAS A COUNSEL OF
DESPAIR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ABSOLUTE INACTION BUT NO CASE COULD BE
SUSTAINED AGAINST HIM HE HAD VISITED FRIENDS IN HAMMERSMITH THAT
NIGHT THE ALIBI WAS COMPLETE IT IS TRUE THAT HE STARTED HOME AT AN
HOUR WHICH SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO WESTMINSTER BEFORE THE TIME
WHEN THE CRIME WAS DISCOVERED BUT HIS OWN EXPLANATION THAT HE HAD
WALKED PART OF THE WAY SEEMED PROBABLE ENOUGH IN VIEW OF THE FINENESS
OF THE NIGHT HE HAD ACTUALLY ARRIVED AT TWELVE OCLOCK AND APPEARED
TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE UNEXPECTED TRAGEDY HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN ON
GOOD TERMS WITH HIS MASTER SEVERAL OF THE DEAD MANS
POSSESSIONSNOTABLY A SMALL CASE OF RAZORSHAD BEEN FOUND IN THE
VALETS BOXES BUT HE EXPLAINED THAT THEY HAD BEEN PRESENTS FROM THE
DECEASED AND THE HOUSEKEEPER WAS ABLE TO CORROBORATE THE STORY
MITTON HAD BEEN IN LUCASS EMPLOYMENT FOR THREE YEARS IT WAS
NOTICEABLE THAT LUCAS DID NOT TAKE MITTON ON THE CONTINENT WITH HIM
SOMETIMES HE VISITED PARIS FOR THREE MONTHS ON END BUT MITTON WAS
LEFT IN CHARGE OF THE GODOLPHIN STREET HOUSE AS TO THE HOUSEKEEPER
SHE HAD HEARD NOTHING ON THE NIGHT OF THE CRIME IF HER MASTER HAD A
VISITOR HE HAD HIMSELF ADMITTED HIM
SO FOR THREE MORNINGS THE MYSTERY REMAINED SO FAR AS I COULD FOLLOW
IT IN THE PAPERS IF HOLMES KNEW MORE HE KEPT HIS OWN COUNSEL BUT
AS HE TOLD ME THAT INSPECTOR LESTRADE HAD TAKEN HIM INTO HIS
CONFIDENCE IN THE CASE I KNEW THAT HE WAS IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH EVERY
DEVELOPMENT UPON THE FOURTH DAY THERE APPEARED A LONG TELEGRAM FROM
PARIS WHICH SEEMED TO SOLVE THE WHOLE QUESTION
A DISCOVERY HAS JUST BEEN MADE BY THE PARISIAN POLICE SAID THE DAILY
TELEGRAPH WHICH RAISES THE VEIL WHICH HUNG ROUND THE TRAGIC FATE OF
MR EDUARDO LUCAS WHO MET HIS DEATH BY VIOLENCE LAST MONDAY NIGHT AT
GODOLPHIN STREET WESTMINSTER OUR READERS WILL REMEMBER THAT THE
DECEASED GENTLEMAN WAS FOUND STABBED IN HIS ROOM AND THAT SOME
SUSPICION ATTACHED TO HIS VALET BUT THAT THE CASE BROKE DOWN ON AN
ALIBI YESTERDAY A LADY WHO HAS BEEN KNOWN AS MME HENRI FOURNAYE
OCCUPYING A SMALL VILLA IN THE RUE AUSTERLITZ WAS REPORTED TO THE
AUTHORITIES BY HER SERVANTS AS BEING INSANE AN EXAMINATION SHOWED
THAT SHE HAD INDEED DEVELOPED MANIA OF A DANGEROUS AND PERMANENT
FORM ON INQUIRY THE POLICE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT MME HENRI FOURNAYE
ONLY RETURNED FROM A JOURNEY TO LONDON ON TUESDAY LAST AND THERE IS
EVIDENCE TO CONNECT HER WITH THE CRIME AT WESTMINSTER A COMPARISON
OF PHOTOGRAPHS HAS PROVED CONCLUSIVELY THAT M HENRI FOURNAYE AND
EDUARDO LUCAS WERE REALLY ONE AND THE SAME PERSON AND THAT THE
DECEASED HAD FOR SOME REASON LIVED A DOUBLE LIFE IN LONDON AND PARIS
MME FOURNAYE WHO IS OF CREOLE ORIGIN IS OF AN EXTREMELY EXCITABLE
NATURE AND HAS SUFFERED IN THE PAST FROM ATTACKS OF JEALOUSY WHICH
HAVE AMOUNTED TO FRENZY IT IS CONJECTURED THAT IT WAS IN ONE OF
THESE THAT SHE COMMITTED THE TERRIBLE CRIME WHICH HAS CAUSED SUCH A
SENSATION IN LONDON HER MOVEMENTS UPON THE MONDAY NIGHT HAVE NOT YET
BEEN TRACED BUT IT IS UNDOUBTED THAT A WOMAN ANSWERING TO HER
DESCRIPTION ATTRACTED MUCH ATTENTION AT CHARING CROSS STATION ON
TUESDAY MORNING BY THE WILDNESS OF HER APPEARANCE AND THE VIOLENCE OF
HER GESTURES IT IS PROBABLE THEREFORE THAT THE CRIME WAS EITHER
COMMITTED WHEN INSANE OR THAT ITS IMMEDIATE EFFECT WAS TO DRIVE THE
UNHAPPY WOMAN OUT OF HER MIND AT PRESENT SHE IS UNABLE TO GIVE ANY
COHERENT ACCOUNT OF THE PAST AND THE DOCTORS HOLD OUT NO HOPES OF
THE REESTABLISHMENT OF HER REASON THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT A WOMAN
WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN MME FOURNAYE WAS SEEN FOR SOME HOURS ON MONDAY
NIGHT WATCHING THE HOUSE IN GODOLPHIN STREET
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT HOLMES I HAD READ THE ACCOUNT ALOUD TO
HIM WHILE HE FINISHED HIS BREAKFAST
MY DEAR WATSON SAID HE AS HE ROSE FROM THE TABLE AND PACED UP AND
DOWN THE ROOM YOU ARE MOST LONGSUFFERING BUT IF I HAVE TOLD YOU
NOTHING IN THE LAST THREE DAYS IT IS BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING TO
TELL EVEN NOW THIS REPORT FROM PARIS DOES NOT HELP US MUCH
SURELY IT IS FINAL AS REGARDS THE MANS DEATH
THE MANS DEATH IS A MERE INCIDENTA TRIVIAL EPISODEIN COMPARISON
WITH OUR REAL TASK WHICH IS TO TRACE THIS DOCUMENT AND SAVE A
EUROPEAN CATASTROPHE ONLY ONE IMPORTANT THING HAS HAPPENED IN THE
LAST THREE DAYS AND THAT IS THAT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED I GET REPORTS
ALMOST HOURLY FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT NOWHERE IN
EUROPE IS THERE ANY SIGN OF TROUBLE NOW IF THIS LETTER WERE
LOOSENO IT CANT BE LOOSEBUT IF IT ISNT LOOSE WHERE CAN IT BE
WHO HAS IT WHY IS IT HELD BACK THATS THE QUESTION THAT BEATS IN MY
BRAIN LIKE A HAMMER WAS IT INDEED A COINCIDENCE THAT LUCAS SHOULD
MEET HIS DEATH ON THE NIGHT WHEN THE LETTER DISAPPEARED DID THE
LETTER EVER REACH HIM IF SO WHY IS IT NOT AMONG HIS PAPERS DID
THIS MAD WIFE OF HIS CARRY IT OFF WITH HER IF SO IS IT IN HER HOUSE
IN PARIS HOW COULD I SEARCH FOR IT WITHOUT THE FRENCH POLICE HAVING
THEIR SUSPICIONS AROUSED IT IS A CASE MY DEAR WATSON WHERE THE LAW
IS AS DANGEROUS TO US AS THE CRIMINALS ARE EVERY MANS HAND IS
AGAINST US AND YET THE INTERESTS AT STAKE ARE COLOSSAL SHOULD I
BRING IT TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION IT WILL CERTAINLY REPRESENT THE
CROWNING GLORY OF MY CAREER AH HERE IS MY LATEST FROM THE FRONT
HE GLANCED HURRIEDLY AT THE NOTE WHICH HAD BEEN HANDED IN HALLOA
LESTRADE SEEMS TO HAVE OBSERVED SOMETHING OF INTEREST PUT ON YOUR
HAT WATSON AND WE WILL STROLL DOWN TOGETHER TO WESTMINSTER
IT WAS MY FIRST VISIT TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIMEA HIGH DINGY
NARROWCHESTED HOUSE PRIM FORMAL AND SOLID LIKE THE CENTURY WHICH
GAVE IT BIRTH LESTRADES BULLDOG FEATURES GAZED OUT AT US FROM THE
FRONT WINDOW AND HE GREETED US WARMLY WHEN A BIG CONSTABLE HAD
OPENED THE DOOR AND LET US IN THE ROOM INTO WHICH WE WERE SHOWN WAS
THAT IN WHICH THE CRIME HAD BEEN COMMITTED BUT NO TRACE OF IT NOW
REMAINED SAVE AN UGLY IRREGULAR STAIN UPON THE CARPET THIS CARPET
WAS A SMALL SQUARE DRUGGET IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM SURROUNDED BY A
BROAD EXPANSE OF BEAUTIFUL OLDFASHIONED WOODFLOORING IN SQUARE
BLOCKS HIGHLY POLISHED OVER THE FIREPLACE WAS A MAGNIFICENT TROPHY
OF WEAPONS ONE OF WHICH HAD BEEN USED ON THAT TRAGIC NIGHT IN THE
WINDOW WAS A SUMPTUOUS WRITINGDESK AND EVERY DETAIL OF THE
APARTMENT THE PICTURES THE RUGS AND THE HANGINGS ALL POINTED TO A
TASTE WHICH WAS LUXURIOUS TO THE VERGE OF EFFEMINACY
SEEN THE PARIS NEWS ASKED LESTRADE
HOLMES NODDED
OUR FRENCH FRIENDS SEEM TO HAVE TOUCHED THE SPOT THIS TIME NO DOUBT
ITS JUST AS THEY SAY SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOORSURPRISE VISIT I
GUESS FOR HE KEPT HIS LIFE IN WATERTIGHT COMPARTMENTS HE LET HER
INCOULDNT KEEP HER IN THE STREET SHE TOLD HIM HOW SHE HAD TRACED
HIM REPROACHED HIM ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER AND THEN WITH THAT
DAGGER SO HANDY THE END SOON CAME IT WASNT ALL DONE IN AN INSTANT
THOUGH FOR THESE CHAIRS WERE ALL SWEPT OVER YONDER AND HE HAD ONE
IN HIS HAND AS IF HE HAD TRIED TO HOLD HER OFF WITH IT WEVE GOT IT
ALL CLEAR AS IF WE HAD SEEN IT
HOLMES RAISED HIS EYEBROWS
AND YET YOU HAVE SENT FOR ME
AH YES THATS ANOTHER MATTERA MERE TRIFLE BUT THE SORT OF THING
YOU TAKE AN INTEREST INQUEER YOU KNOW AND WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL
FREAKISH IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MAIN FACTCANT HAVE ON THE
FACE OF IT
WHAT IS IT THEN
WELL YOU KNOW AFTER A CRIME OF THIS SORT WE ARE VERY CAREFUL TO
KEEP THINGS IN THEIR POSITION NOTHING HAS BEEN MOVED OFFICER IN
CHARGE HERE DAY AND NIGHT THIS MORNING AS THE MAN WAS BURIED AND
THE INVESTIGATION OVERSO FAR AS THIS ROOM IS CONCERNEDWE THOUGHT
WE COULD TIDY UP A BIT THIS CARPET YOU SEE IT IS NOT FASTENED
DOWN ONLY JUST LAID THERE WE HAD OCCASION TO RAISE IT WE FOUND
YES YOU FOUND
HOLMESS FACE GREW TENSE WITH ANXIETY
WELL IM SURE YOU WOULD NEVER GUESS IN A HUNDRED YEARS WHAT WE DID
FIND YOU SEE THAT STAIN ON THE CARPET WELL A GREAT DEAL MUST HAVE
SOAKED THROUGH MUST IT NOT
UNDOUBTEDLY IT MUST
WELL YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THERE IS NO STAIN ON THE
WHITE WOODWORK TO CORRESPOND
NO STAIN BUT THERE MUST
YES SO YOU WOULD SAY BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT THERE ISNT
HE TOOK THE CORNER OF THE CARPET IN HIS HAND AND TURNING IT OVER HE
SHOWED THAT IT WAS INDEED AS HE SAID
BUT THE UNDERSIDE IS AS STAINED AS THE UPPER IT MUST HAVE LEFT A
MARK
LESTRADE CHUCKLED WITH DELIGHT AT HAVING PUZZLED THE FAMOUS EXPERT
NOW ILL SHOW YOU THE EXPLANATION THERE IS A SECOND STAIN BUT IT
DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH THE OTHER SEE FOR YOURSELF AS HE SPOKE HE
TURNED OVER ANOTHER PORTION OF THE CARPET AND THERE SURE ENOUGH
WAS A GREAT CRIMSON SPILL UPON THE SQUARE WHITE FACING OF THE
OLDFASHIONED FLOOR WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT MR HOLMES
WHY IT IS SIMPLE ENOUGH THE TWO STAINS DID CORRESPOND BUT THE
CARPET HAS BEEN TURNED ROUND AS IT WAS SQUARE AND UNFASTENED IT WAS
EASILY DONE
THE OFFICIAL POLICE DONT NEED YOU MR HOLMES TO TELL THEM THAT
THE CARPET MUST HAVE BEEN TURNED ROUND THATS CLEAR ENOUGH FOR THE
STAINS LIE ABOVE EACH OTHERIF YOU LAY IT OVER THIS WAY BUT WHAT I
WANT TO KNOW IS WHO SHIFTED THE CARPET AND WHY
I COULD SEE FROM HOLMESS RIGID FACE THAT HE WAS VIBRATING WITH
INWARD EXCITEMENT
LOOK HERE LESTRADE SAID HE HAS THAT CONSTABLE IN THE PASSAGE
BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE PLACE ALL THE TIME
YES HE HAS
WELL TAKE MY ADVICE EXAMINE HIM CAREFULLY DONT DO IT BEFORE US
WELL WAIT HERE YOU TAKE HIM INTO THE BACK ROOM YOULL BE MORE
LIKELY TO GET A CONFESSION OUT OF HIM ALONE ASK HIM HOW HE DARED TO
ADMIT PEOPLE AND LEAVE THEM ALONE IN THIS ROOM DONT ASK HIM IF HE
HAS DONE IT TAKE IT FOR GRANTED TELL HIM YOU KNOW SOMEONE HAS BEEN
HERE PRESS HIM TELL HIM THAT A FULL CONFESSION IS HIS ONLY CHANCE
OF FORGIVENESS DO EXACTLY WHAT I TELL YOU
BY GEORGE IF HE KNOWS ILL HAVE IT OUT OF HIM CRIED LESTRADE HE
DARTED INTO THE HALL AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER HIS BULLYING VOICE
SOUNDED FROM THE BACK ROOM
NOW WATSON NOW CRIED HOLMES WITH FRENZIED EAGERNESS ALL THE
DEMONIACAL FORCE OF THE MAN MASKED BEHIND THAT LISTLESS MANNER BURST
OUT IN A PAROXYSM OF ENERGY HE TORE THE DRUGGET FROM THE FLOOR AND
IN AN INSTANT WAS DOWN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES CLAWING AT EACH OF THE
SQUARES OF WOOD BENEATH IT ONE TURNED SIDEWAYS AS HE DUG HIS NAILS
INTO THE EDGE OF IT IT HINGED BACK LIKE THE LID OF A BOX A SMALL
BLACK CAVITY OPENED BENEATH IT HOLMES PLUNGED HIS EAGER HAND INTO
IT AND DREW IT OUT WITH A BITTER SNARL OF ANGER AND DISAPPOINTMENT
IT WAS EMPTY
QUICK WATSON QUICK GET IT BACK AGAIN THE WOODEN LID WAS
REPLACED AND THE DRUGGET HAD ONLY JUST BEEN DRAWN STRAIGHT WHEN
LESTRADES VOICE WAS HEARD IN THE PASSAGE HE FOUND HOLMES LEANING
LANGUIDLY AGAINST THE MANTELPIECE RESIGNED AND PATIENT ENDEAVOURING
TO CONCEAL HIS IRREPRESSIBLE YAWNS
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING MR HOLMES I CAN SEE THAT YOU ARE BORED
TO DEATH WITH THE WHOLE AFFAIR WELL HE HAS CONFESSED ALL RIGHT

INEXCUSABLE CONDUCT

I MEANT NO HARM SIR IM SURE THE YOUNG WOMAN CAME TO THE DOOR
LAST EVENINGMISTOOK THE HOUSE SHE DID AND THEN WE GOT TALKING
ITS LONESOME WHEN YOURE ON DUTY HERE ALL DAY

SHE WANTED TO SEE WHERE THE CRIME WAS DONEHAD READ ABOUT IT IN THE
PAPERS SHE SAID SHE WAS A VERY RESPECTABLE WELLSPOKEN YOUNG
WOMAN SIR AND I SAW NO HARM IN LETTING HER HAVE A PEEP WHEN SHE
SAW THAT MARK ON THE CARPET DOWN SHE DROPPED ON THE FLOOR AND LAY
AS IF SHE WERE DEAD I RAN TO THE BACK AND GOT SOME WATER BUT I
COULD NOT BRING HER TO THEN I WENT ROUND THE CORNER TO THE IVY PLANT
FOR SOME BRANDY AND BY THE TIME I HAD BROUGHT IT BACK THE YOUNG
WOMAN HAD RECOVERED AND WAS OFFASHAMED OF HERSELF I DARE SAY AND
DARED NOT FACE ME

MACPHERSON SAID LESTRADE WITH DIGNITY NO DOUBT YOU THOUGHT THAT
YOUR BREACH OF DUTY COULD NEVER BE DISCOVERED AND YET A MERE GLANCE
AT THAT DRUGGET WAS ENOUGH TO CONVINCE ME THAT SOMEONE HAD BEEN
ADMITTED TO THE ROOM ITS LUCKY FOR YOU MY MAN THAT NOTHING IS
MISSING OR YOU WOULD FIND YOURSELF IN QUEER STREET IM SORRY TO
HAVE CALLED YOU DOWN OVER SUCH A PETTY BUSINESS MR HOLMES BUT I
THOUGHT THE POINT OF THE SECOND STAIN NOT CORRESPONDING WITH THE

LOVING GIRL I MEANT NO HARM AND YET HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT
CRIMINAL HAD HE READ THAT LETTER HIS CONFIDENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR
EVER DESTROYED IT IS YEARS SINCE I WROTE IT I HAD THOUGHT THAT THE
WHOLE MATTER WAS FORGOTTEN THEN AT LAST I HEARD FROM THIS MAN
LUCAS THAT IT HAD PASSED INTO HIS HANDS AND THAT HE WOULD LAY IT
BEFORE MY HUSBAND I IMPLORED HIS MERCY HE SAID THAT HE WOULD RETURN
MY LETTER IF I WOULD BRING HIM A CERTAIN DOCUMENT WHICH HE DESCRIBED
IN MY HUSBANDS DESPATCHBOX HE HAD SOME SPY IN THE OFFICE WHO HAD
TOLD HIM OF ITS EXISTENCE HE ASSURED ME THAT NO HARM COULD COME TO
MY HUSBAND PUT YOURSELF IN MY POSITION MR HOLMES WHAT WAS I TO
DO
TAKE YOUR HUSBAND INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE
I COULD NOT MR HOLMES I COULD NOT ON THE ONE SIDE SEEMED CERTAIN
RUIN ON THE OTHER TERRIBLE AS IT SEEMED TO TAKE MY HUSBANDS PAPER
STILL IN A MATTER OF POLITICS I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE
CONSEQUENCES WHILE IN A MATTER OF LOVE AND TRUST THEY WERE ONLY TOO
CLEAR TO ME I DID IT MR HOLMES I TOOK AN IMPRESSION OF HIS KEY
THIS MAN LUCAS FURNISHED A DUPLICATE I OPENED HIS DESPATCHBOX TOOK
THE PAPER AND CONVEYED IT TO GODOLPHIN STREET
WHAT HAPPENED THERE MADAM
I TAPPED AT THE DOOR AS AGREED LUCAS OPENED IT I FOLLOWED HIM INTO
HIS ROOM LEAVING THE HALL DOOR AJAR BEHIND ME FOR I FEARED TO BE
ALONE WITH THE MAN I REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS A WOMAN OUTSIDE AS I
ENTERED OUR BUSINESS WAS SOON DONE HE HAD MY LETTER ON HIS DESK I
HANDED HIM THE DOCUMENT HE GAVE ME THE LETTER AT THIS INSTANT THERE
WAS A SOUND AT THE DOOR THERE WERE STEPS IN THE PASSAGE LUCAS
QUICKLY TURNED BACK THE DRUGGET THRUST THE DOCUMENT INTO SOME
HIDINGPLACE THERE AND COVERED IT OVER
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT IS LIKE SOME FEARFUL DREAM I HAVE A VISION
OF A DARK FRANTIC FACE OF A WOMANS VOICE WHICH SCREAMED IN
FRENCH MY WAITING IS NOT IN VAIN AT LAST AT LAST I HAVE FOUND YOU
WITH HER THERE WAS A SAVAGE STRUGGLE I SAW HIM WITH A CHAIR IN HIS
HAND A KNIFE GLEAMED IN HERS I RUSHED FROM THE HORRIBLE SCENE RAN
FROM THE HOUSE AND ONLY NEXT MORNING IN THE PAPER DID I LEARN THE
DREADFUL RESULT THAT NIGHT I WAS HAPPY FOR I HAD MY LETTER AND I
HAD NOT SEEN YET WHAT THE FUTURE WOULD BRING
IT WAS THE NEXT MORNING THAT I REALIZED THAT I HAD ONLY EXCHANGED
ONE TROUBLE FOR ANOTHER MY HUSBANDS ANGUISH AT THE LOSS OF HIS
PAPER WENT TO MY HEART I COULD HARDLY PREVENT MYSELF FROM THERE AND
THEN KNEELING DOWN AT HIS FEET AND TELLING HIM WHAT I HAD DONE BUT
THAT AGAIN WOULD MEAN A CONFESSION OF THE PAST I CAME TO YOU THAT
MORNING IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL ENORMITY OF MY OFFENCE FROM
THE INSTANT THAT I GRASPED IT MY WHOLE MIND WAS TURNED TO THE ONE
THOUGHT OF GETTING BACK MY HUSBANDS PAPER IT MUST STILL BE WHERE
LUCAS HAD PLACED IT FOR IT WAS CONCEALED BEFORE THIS DREADFUL WOMAN
ENTERED THE ROOM IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HER COMING I SHOULD NOT
HAVE KNOWN WHERE HIS HIDINGPLACE WAS HOW WAS I TO GET INTO THE
ROOM FOR TWO DAYS I WATCHED THE PLACE BUT THE DOOR WAS NEVER LEFT
OPEN LAST NIGHT I MADE A LAST ATTEMPT WHAT I DID AND HOW I
SUCCEEDED YOU HAVE ALREADY LEARNED I BROUGHT THE PAPER BACK WITH
ME AND THOUGHT OF DESTROYING IT SINCE I COULD SEE NO WAY OF
RETURNING IT WITHOUT CONFESSING MY GUILT TO MY HUSBAND HEAVENS I
HEAR HIS STEP UPON THE STAIR
THE EUROPEAN SECRETARY BURST EXCITEDLY INTO THE ROOM
ANY NEWS MR HOLMES ANY NEWS HE CRIED
I HAVE SOME HOPES
AH THANK HEAVEN HIS FACE BECAME RADIANT THE PRIME MINISTER IS
LUNCHING WITH ME MAY HE SHARE YOUR HOPES HE HAS NERVES OF STEEL
AND YET I KNOW THAT HE HAS HARDLY SLEPT SINCE THIS TERRIBLE EVENT
JACOBS WILL YOU ASK THE PRIME MINISTER TO COME UP AS TO YOU DEAR
I FEAR THAT THIS IS A MATTER OF POLITICS WE WILL JOIN YOU IN A FEW
MINUTES IN THE DININGROOM
THE PRIME MINISTERS MANNER WAS SUBDUED BUT I COULD SEE BY THE GLEAM
OF HIS EYES AND THE TWITCHINGS OF HIS BONY HANDS THAT HE SHARED THE
EXCITEMENT OF HIS YOUNG COLLEAGUE
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT MR HOLMES
PURELY NEGATIVE AS YET MY FRIEND ANSWERED I HAVE INQUIRED AT
EVERY POINT WHERE IT MIGHT BE AND I AM SURE THAT THERE IS NO DANGER
TO BE APPREHENDED
BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH MR HOLMES WE CANNOT LIVE FOR EVER ON SUCH
A VOLCANO WE MUST HAVE SOMETHING DEFINITE
I AM IN HOPES OF GETTING IT THAT IS WHY I AM HERE THE MORE I THINK
OF THE MATTER THE MORE CONVINCED I AM THAT THE LETTER HAS NEVER LEFT
THIS HOUSE
MR HOLMES
IF IT HAD IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN PUBLIC BY NOW
BUT WHY SHOULD ANYONE TAKE IT IN ORDER TO KEEP IT IN HIS HOUSE
I AM NOT CONVINCED THAT ANYONE DID TAKE IT
THEN HOW COULD IT LEAVE THE DESPATCHBOX
I AM NOT CONVINCED THAT IT EVER DID LEAVE THE DESPATCHBOX
MR HOLMES THIS JOKING IS VERY ILLTIMED YOU HAVE MY ASSURANCE
THAT IT LEFT THE BOX
HAVE YOU EXAMINED THE BOX SINCE TUESDAY MORNING
NO IT WAS NOT NECESSARY
YOU MAY CONCEIVABLY HAVE OVERLOOKED IT
IMPOSSIBLE I SAY
BUT I AM NOT CONVINCED OF IT I HAVE KNOWN SUCH THINGS TO HAPPEN I
PRESUME THERE ARE OTHER PAPERS THERE WELL IT MAY HAVE GOT MIXED
WITH THEM
IT WAS ON THE TOP
SOMEONE MAY HAVE SHAKEN THE BOX AND DISPLACED IT
NO NO I HAD EVERYTHING OUT
SURELY IT IS EASILY DECIDED HOPE SAID THE PREMIER LET US HAVE
THE DESPATCHBOX BROUGHT IN

CHAPTER I
MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
MR SHERLOCK HOLMES WHO WAS USUALLY VERY LATE IN THE MORNINGS SAVE
UPON THOSE NOT INFREQUENT OCCASIONS WHEN HE WAS UP ALL NIGHT WAS
SEATED AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE I STOOD UPON THE HEARTHRUG AND PICKED
UP THE STICK WHICH OUR VISITOR HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE
IT WAS A FINE THICK PIECE OF WOOD BULBOUSHEADED OF THE SORT WHICH
IS KNOWN AS A PENANG LAWYER JUST UNDER THE HEAD WAS A BROAD SILVER
BAND NEARLY AN INCH ACROSS TO JAMES MORTIMER MRCS FROM HIS
FRIENDS OF THE CCH WAS ENGRAVED UPON IT WITH THE DATE IT WAS JUST SUCH
A STICK AS THE OLDFASHIONED FAMILY PRACTITIONER
USED TO CARRYDIGNIFIED SOLID AND REASSURING
WELL WATSON WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
HOLMES WAS SITTING WITH HIS BACK TO ME AND I HAD GIVEN HIM NO SIGN
OF MY OCCUPATION
HOW DID YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING I BELIEVE YOU HAVE EYES IN THE
BACK OF YOUR HEAD
I HAVE AT LEAST A WELLPOLISHED SILVERPLATED COFFEEPOT IN FRONT
OF ME SAID HE BUT TELL ME WATSON WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF OUR
VISITORS STICK SINCE WE HAVE BEEN SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO MISS HIM AND
HAVE NO NOTION OF HIS ERRAND THIS ACCIDENTAL SOUVENIR BECOMES OF
IMPORTANCE LET ME HEAR YOU RECONSTRUCT THE MAN BY AN EXAMINATION OF
IT
I THINK SAID I FOLLOWING AS FAR AS I COULD THE METHODS OF MY
COMPANION THAT DR MORTIMER IS A SUCCESSFUL ELDERLY MEDICAL MAN
WELLESTEEMED SINCE THOSE WHO KNOW HIM GIVE HIM THIS MARK OF THEIR
APPRECIATION
GOOD SAID HOLMES EXCELLENT
I THINK ALSO THAT THE PROBABILITY IS IN FAVOUR OF HIS BEING A
COUNTRY PRACTITIONER WHO DOES A GREAT DEAL OF HIS VISITING ON FOOT
WHY SO
BECAUSE THIS STICK THOUGH ORIGINALLY A VERY HANDSOME ONE HAS BEEN
SO KNOCKED ABOUT THAT I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE A TOWN PRACTITIONER
CARRYING IT THE THICKIRON FERRULE IS WORN DOWN SO IT IS EVIDENT
THAT HE HAS DONE A GREAT AMOUNT OF WALKING WITH IT
PERFECTLY SOUND SAID HOLMES
AND THEN AGAIN THERE IS THE FRIENDS OF THE CCH I SHOULD GUESS
THAT TO BE THE SOMETHING HUNT THE LOCAL HUNT TO WHOSE MEMBERS HE HAS
POSSIBLY GIVEN SOME SURGICAL ASSISTANCE AND WHICH HAS MADE HIM A
SMALL PRESENTATION IN RETURN
REALLY WATSON YOU EXCEL YOURSELF SAID HOLMES PUSHING BACK HIS
CHAIR AND LIGHTING A CIGARETTE I AM BOUND TO SAY THAT IN ALL THE
ACCOUNTS WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN SO GOOD AS TO GIVE OF MY OWN SMALL
ACHIEVEMENTS YOU HAVE HABITUALLY UNDERRATED YOUR OWN ABILITIES IT
MAY BE THAT YOU ARE NOT YOURSELF LUMINOUS BUT YOU ARE A CONDUCTOR OF
LIGHT SOME PEOPLE WITHOUT POSSESSING GENIUS HAVE A REMARKABLE POWER
OF STIMULATING IT I CONFESS MY DEAR FELLOW THAT I AM VERY MUCH IN
YOUR DEBT
HE HAD NEVER SAID AS MUCH BEFORE AND I MUST ADMIT THAT HIS WORDS
GAVE ME KEEN PLEASURE FOR I HAD OFTEN BEEN PIQUED BY HIS
INDIFFERENCE TO MY ADMIRATION AND TO THE ATTEMPTS WHICH I HAD MADE TO
GIVE PUBLICITY TO HIS METHODS I WAS PROUD TOO TO THINK THAT I HAD
SO FAR MASTERED HIS SYSTEM AS TO APPLY IT IN A WAY WHICH EARNED HIS
APPROVAL HE NOW TOOK THE STICK FROM MY HANDS AND EXAMINED IT FOR A
FEW MINUTES WITH HIS NAKED EYES THEN WITH AN EXPRESSION OF INTEREST
HE LAID DOWN HIS CIGARETTE AND CARRYING THE CANE TO THE WINDOW HE
LOOKED OVER IT AGAIN WITH A CONVEX LENS
INTERESTING THOUGH ELEMENTARY SAID HE AS HE RETURNED TO HIS
FAVOURITE CORNER OF THE SETTEE THERE ARE CERTAINLY ONE OR TWO
INDICATIONS UPON THE STICK IT GIVES US THE BASIS FOR SEVERAL
DEDUCTIONS
HAS ANYTHING ESCAPED ME I ASKED WITH SOME SELFIMPORTANCE I
TRUST THAT THERE IS NOTHING OF CONSEQUENCE WHICH I HAVE OVERLOOKED
I AM AFRAID MY DEAR WATSON THAT MOST OF YOUR CONCLUSIONS WERE
ERRONEOUS WHEN I SAID THAT YOU STIMULATED ME I MEANT TO BE FRANK
THAT IN NOTING YOUR FALLACIES I WAS OCCASIONALLY GUIDED TOWARDS THE
TRUTH NOT THAT YOU ARE ENTIRELY WRONG IN THIS INSTANCE THE MAN IS
CERTAINLY A COUNTRY PRACTITIONER AND HE WALKS A GOOD DEAL
THEN I WAS RIGHT
TO THAT EXTENT
BUT THAT WAS ALL
NO NO MY DEAR WATSON NOT ALLBY NO MEANS ALL I WOULD SUGGEST
FOR EXAMPLE THAT A PRESENTATION TO A DOCTOR IS MORE LIKELY TO COME
FROM A HOSPITAL THAN FROM A HUNT AND THAT WHEN THE INITIALS CC
ARE PLACED BEFORE THAT HOSPITAL THE WORDS CHARING CROSS VERY
NATURALLY SUGGEST THEMSELVES
YOU MAY BE RIGHT
THE PROBABILITY LIES IN THAT DIRECTION AND IF WE TAKE THIS AS A
WORKING HYPOTHESIS WE HAVE A FRESH BASIS FROM WHICH TO START OUR
CONSTRUCTION OF THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR
WELL THEN SUPPOSING THAT CCH DOES STAND FOR CHARING CROSS
HOSPITAL WHAT FURTHER INFERENCES MAY WE DRAW
DO NONE SUGGEST THEMSELVES YOU KNOW MY METHODS APPLY THEM
I CAN ONLY THINK OF THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION THAT THE MAN HAS
PRACTISED IN TOWN BEFORE GOING TO THE COUNTRY
I THINK THAT WE MIGHT VENTURE A LITTLE FARTHER THAN THIS LOOK AT IT
IN THIS LIGHT ON WHAT OCCASION WOULD IT BE MOST PROBABLE THAT SUCH A
PRESENTATION WOULD BE MADE WHEN WOULD HIS FRIENDS UNITE TO GIVE HIM
A PLEDGE OF THEIR GOOD WILL OBVIOUSLY AT THE MOMENT WHEN DR
MORTIMER WITHDREW FROM THE SERVICE OF THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO START
IN PRACTICE FOR HIMSELF WE KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A PRESENTATION WE
BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE FROM A TOWN HOSPITAL TO A COUNTRY
PRACTICE IS IT THEN STRETCHING OUR INFERENCE TOO FAR TO SAY THAT
THE PRESENTATION WAS ON THE OCCASION OF THE CHANGE
IT CERTAINLY SEEMS PROBABLE
NOW YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE STAFF OF
THE HOSPITAL SINCE ONLY A MAN WELLESTABLISHED IN A LONDON PRACTICE
COULD HOLD SUCH A POSITION AND SUCH A ONE WOULD NOT DRIFT INTO THE
COUNTRY WHAT WAS HE THEN IF HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL AND YET NOT ON
THE STAFF HE COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN A HOUSESURGEON OR A
HOUSEPHYSICIANLITTLE MORE THAN A SENIOR STUDENT AND HE LEFT FIVE
YEARS AGOTHE DATE IS ON THE STICK SO YOUR GRAVE MIDDLEAGED
FAMILY PRACTITIONER VANISHES INTO THIN AIR MY DEAR WATSON AND THERE
EMERGES A YOUNG FELLOW UNDER THIRTY AMIABLE UNAMBITIOUS
ABSENTMINDED AND THE POSSESSOR OF A FAVOURITE DOG WHICH I SHOULD
DESCRIBE ROUGHLY AS BEING LARGER THAN A TERRIER AND SMALLER THAN A
MASTIFF
I LAUGHED INCREDULOUSLY AS SHERLOCK HOLMES LEANED BACK IN HIS SETTEE
AND BLEW LITTLE WAVERING RINGS OF SMOKE UP TO THE CEILING
AS TO THE LATTER PART I HAVE NO MEANS OF CHECKING YOU SAID I
BUT AT LEAST IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT A FEW PARTICULARS ABOUT
THE MANS AGE AND PROFESSIONAL CAREER FROM MY SMALL MEDICAL SHELF I
TOOK DOWN THE MEDICAL DIRECTORY AND TURNED UP THE NAME THERE WERE
SEVERAL MORTIMERS BUT ONLY ONE WHO COULD BE OUR VISITOR I READ HIS
RECORD ALOUD
MORTIMER JAMES MRCS GRIMPEN DARTMOOR DEVON
HOUSESURGEON FROM TO AT CHARING CROSS HOSPITAL WINNER
OF THE JACKSON PRIZE FOR COMPARATIVE PATHOLOGY WITH ESSAY ENTITLED
IS DISEASE A REVERSION CORRESPONDING MEMBER OF THE SWEDISH
PATHOLOGICAL SOCIETY AUTHOR OF SOME FREAKS OF ATAVISM LANCET
DO WE PROGRESS JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY MARCH MEDICAL OFFICER FOR THE
PARISHES OF GRIMPEN THORSLEY AND HIGH
BARROW
NO MENTION OF THAT LOCAL HUNT WATSON SAID HOLMES WITH A
MISCHIEVOUS SMILE BUT A COUNTRY DOCTOR AS YOU VERY ASTUTELY
OBSERVED I THINK THAT I AM FAIRLY JUSTIFIED IN MY INFERENCES AS TO
THE ADJECTIVES I SAID IF I REMEMBER RIGHT AMIABLE UNAMBITIOUS
AND ABSENTMINDED IT IS MY EXPERIENCE THAT IT IS ONLY AN AMIABLE MAN
IN THIS WORLD WHO RECEIVES TESTIMONIALS ONLY AN UNAMBITIOUS ONE WHO
ABANDONS A LONDON CAREER FOR THE COUNTRY AND ONLY AN ABSENTMINDED
ONE WHO LEAVES HIS STICK AND NOT HIS VISITINGCARD AFTER WAITING AN
HOUR IN YOUR ROOM
AND THE DOG
HAS BEEN IN THE HABIT OF CARRYING THIS STICK BEHIND HIS MASTER
BEING A HEAVY STICK THE DOG HAS HELD IT TIGHTLY BY THE MIDDLE AND
THE MARKS OF HIS TEETH ARE VERY PLAINLY VISIBLE THE DOGS JAW AS
SHOWN IN THE SPACE BETWEEN THESE MARKS IS TOO BROAD IN MY OPINION
FOR A TERRIER AND NOT BROAD ENOUGH FOR A MASTIFF IT MAY HAVE
BEENYES BY JOVE IT IS A CURLYHAIRED SPANIEL
HE HAD RISEN AND PACED THE ROOM AS HE SPOKE NOW HE HALTED IN THE
RECESS OF THE WINDOW THERE WAS SUCH A RING OF CONVICTION IN HIS
VOICE THAT I GLANCED UP IN SURPRISE
MY DEAR FELLOW HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY BE SO SURE OF THAT
FOR THE VERY SIMPLE REASON THAT I SEE THE DOG HIMSELF ON OUR VERY
DOORSTEP AND THERE IS THE RING OF ITS OWNER DONT MOVE I BEG YOU
WATSON HE IS A PROFESSIONAL BROTHER OF YOURS AND YOUR PRESENCE MAY
BE OF ASSISTANCE TO ME NOW IS THE DRAMATIC MOMENT OF FATE WATSON
WHEN YOU HEAR A STEP UPON THE STAIR WHICH IS WALKING INTO YOUR LIFE
AND YOU KNOW NOT WHETHER FOR GOOD OR ILL WHAT DOES DR JAMES
MORTIMER THE MAN OF SCIENCE ASK OF SHERLOCK HOLMES THE SPECIALIST
IN CRIME COME IN
THE APPEARANCE OF OUR VISITOR WAS A SURPRISE TO ME SINCE I HAD
EXPECTED A TYPICAL COUNTRY PRACTITIONER HE WAS A VERY TALL THIN
MAN WITH A LONG NOSE LIKE A BEAK WHICH JUTTED OUT BETWEEN TWO KEEN
GRAY EYES SET CLOSELY TOGETHER AND SPARKLING BRIGHTLY FROM BEHIND A
PAIR OF GOLDRIMMED GLASSES HE WAS CLAD IN A PROFESSIONAL BUT RATHER
SLOVENLY FASHION FOR HIS FROCKCOAT WAS DINGY AND HIS TROUSERS
FRAYED THOUGH YOUNG HIS LONG BACK WAS ALREADY BOWED AND HE WALKED
WITH A FORWARD THRUST OF HIS HEAD AND A GENERAL AIR OF PEERING
BENEVOLENCE AS HE ENTERED HIS EYES FELL UPON THE STICK IN HOLMESS
HAND AND HE RAN TOWARDS IT WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF JOY I AM SO VERY
GLAD SAID HE I WAS NOT SURE WHETHER I HAD LEFT IT HERE OR IN THE
SHIPPING OFFICE I WOULD NOT LOSE THAT STICK FOR THE WORLD
A PRESENTATION I SEE SAID HOLMES
YES SIR
FROM CHARING CROSS HOSPITAL
FROM ONE OR TWO FRIENDS THERE ON THE OCCASION OF MY MARRIAGE
DEAR DEAR THATS BAD SAID HOLMES SHAKING HIS HEAD
DR MORTIMER BLINKED THROUGH HIS GLASSES IN MILD ASTONISHMENT
WHY WAS IT BAD
ONLY THAT YOU HAVE DISARRANGED OUR LITTLE DEDUCTIONS YOUR MARRIAGE
YOU SAY
YES SIR I MARRIED AND SO LEFT THE HOSPITAL AND WITH IT ALL HOPES
OF A CONSULTING PRACTICE IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE A HOME OF MY OWN
COME COME WE ARE NOT SO FAR WRONG AFTER ALL SAID HOLMES AND
NOW DR JAMES MORTIMER
MISTER SIR MISTERA HUMBLE MRCS
AND A MAN OF PRECISE MIND EVIDENTLY
A DABBLER IN SCIENCE MR HOLMES A PICKER UP OF SHELLS ON THE
SHORES OF THE GREAT UNKNOWN OCEAN I PRESUME THAT IT IS MR SHERLOCK
HOLMES WHOM I AM ADDRESSING AND NOT
NO THIS IS MY FRIEND DR WATSON
GLAD TO MEET YOU SIR I HAVE HEARD YOUR NAME MENTIONED IN
CONNECTION WITH THAT OF YOUR FRIEND YOU INTEREST ME VERY MUCH MR
HOLMES I HAD HARDLY EXPECTED SO DOLICHOCEPHALIC A SKULL OR SUCH
WELLMARKED SUPRAORBITAL DEVELOPMENT WOULD YOU HAVE ANY OBJECTION
TO MY RUNNING MY FINGER ALONG YOUR PARIETAL FISSURE A CAST OF YOUR
SKULL SIR UNTIL THE ORIGINAL IS AVAILABLE WOULD BE AN ORNAMENT TO
ANY ANTHROPOLOGICAL MUSEUM IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO BE FULSOME BUT
I CONFESS THAT I COVET YOUR SKULL
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAVED OUR STRANGE VISITOR INTO A CHAIR YOU ARE AN
ENTHUSIAST IN YOUR LINE OF THOUGHT I PERCEIVE SIR AS I AM IN
MINE SAID HE I OBSERVE FROM YOUR FOREFINGER THAT YOU MAKE YOUR
OWN CIGARETTES HAVE NO HESITATION IN LIGHTING ONE
THE MAN DREW OUT PAPER AND TOBACCO AND TWIRLED THE ONE UP IN THE
OTHER WITH SURPRISING DEXTERITY HE HAD LONG QUIVERING FINGERS AS
AGILE AND RESTLESS AS THE ANTENNAE OF AN INSECT
HOLMES WAS SILENT BUT HIS LITTLE DARTING GLANCES SHOWED ME THE
INTEREST WHICH HE TOOK IN OUR CURIOUS COMPANION
I PRESUME SIR SAID HE AT LAST THAT IT WAS NOT MERELY FOR THE
PURPOSE OF EXAMINING MY SKULL THAT YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOUR TO
CALL HERE LAST NIGHT AND AGAIN TODAY
NO SIR NO THOUGH I AM HAPPY TO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF DOING
THAT AS WELL I CAME TO YOU MR HOLMES BECAUSE I RECOGNIZED THAT I
AM MYSELF AN UNPRACTICAL MAN AND BECAUSE I AM SUDDENLY CONFRONTED
WITH A MOST SERIOUS AND EXTRAORDINARY PROBLEM RECOGNIZING AS I DO
THAT YOU ARE THE SECOND HIGHEST EXPERT IN EUROPE
INDEED SIR MAY I INQUIRE WHO HAS THE HONOUR TO BE THE FIRST
ASKED HOLMES WITH SOME ASPERITY
TO THE MAN OF PRECISELY SCIENTIFIC MIND THE WORK OF MONSIEUR
BERTILLON MUST ALWAYS APPEAL STRONGLY
THEN HAD YOU NOT BETTER CONSULT HIM
I SAID SIR TO THE PRECISELY SCIENTIFIC MIND BUT AS A PRACTICAL
MAN OF AFFAIRS IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT YOU STAND ALONE I TRUST SIR
THAT I HAVE NOT INADVERTENTLY
JUST A LITTLE SAID HOLMES I THINK DR MORTIMER YOU WOULD DO
WISELY IF WITHOUT MORE ADO YOU WOULD KINDLY TELL ME PLAINLY WHAT THE
EXACT NATURE OF THE PROBLEM IS IN WHICH YOU DEMAND MY ASSISTANCE
CHAPTER II
THE CURSE OF THE BASKERVILLES
I HAVE IN MY POCKET A MANUSCRIPT SAID DR JAMES MORTIMER
I OBSERVED IT AS YOU ENTERED THE ROOM SAID HOLMES
IT IS AN OLD MANUSCRIPT
EARLY EIGHTEENTH CENTURY UNLESS IT IS A FORGERY
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT SIR
YOU HAVE PRESENTED AN INCH OR TWO OF IT TO MY EXAMINATION ALL THE
TIME THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING IT WOULD BE A POOR EXPERT WHO COULD
NOT GIVE THE DATE OF A DOCUMENT WITHIN A DECADE OR SO YOU MAY
POSSIBLY HAVE READ MY LITTLE MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT I PUT THAT
AT THE EXACT DATE IS DR MORTIMER DREW IT FROM HIS
BREASTPOCKET THIS FAMILY PAPER WAS COMMITTED TO MY CARE BY SIR
CHARLES BASKERVILLE WHOSE SUDDEN AND TRAGIC DEATH SOME THREE MONTHS
AGO CREATED SO MUCH EXCITEMENT IN DEVONSHIRE I MAY SAY THAT I WAS
HIS PERSONAL FRIEND AS WELL AS HIS MEDICAL ATTENDANT HE WAS A
STRONGMINDED MAN SIR SHREWD PRACTICAL AND AS UNIMAGINATIVE AS I
AM MYSELF YET HE TOOK THIS DOCUMENT VERY SERIOUSLY AND HIS MIND WAS
PREPARED FOR JUST SUCH AN END AS DID EVENTUALLY OVERTAKE HIM
HOLMES STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND FOR THE MANUSCRIPT AND FLATTENED IT
UPON HIS KNEE
YOU WILL OBSERVE WATSON THE ALTERNATIVE USE OF THE LONG S AND THE
SHORT IT IS ONE OF SEVERAL INDICATIONS WHICH ENABLED ME TO FIX THE
DATE
I LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER AT THE YELLOW PAPER AND THE FADED SCRIPT
AT THE HEAD WAS WRITTEN BASKERVILLE HALL AND BELOW IN LARGE
SCRAWLING FIGURES IT APPEARS TO BE A STATEMENT OF SOME SORT
YES IT IS A STATEMENT OF A CERTAIN LEGEND WHICH RUNS IN THE
BASKERVILLE FAMILY
BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS SOMETHING MORE MODERN AND PRACTICAL UPON
WHICH YOU WISH TO CONSULT ME
MOST MODERN A MOST PRACTICAL PRESSING MATTER WHICH MUST BE
DECIDED WITHIN TWENTYFOUR HOURS BUT THE MANUSCRIPT IS SHORT AND IS
INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE AFFAIR WITH YOUR PERMISSION I WILL
READ IT TO YOU
HOLMES LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR PLACED HIS FINGERTIPS TOGETHER AND
CLOSED HIS EYES WITH AN AIR OF RESIGNATION DR MORTIMER TURNED THE
MANUSCRIPT TO THE LIGHT AND READ IN A HIGH CRACKING VOICE THE
FOLLOWING CURIOUS OLDWORLD NARRATIVE
OF THE ORIGIN OF THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES THERE HAVE BEEN MANY
STATEMENTS YET AS I COME IN A DIRECT LINE FROM HUGO BASKERVILLE AND
AS I HAD THE STORY FROM MY FATHER WHO ALSO HAD IT FROM HIS I HAVE
SET IT DOWN WITH ALL BELIEF THAT IT OCCURRED EVEN AS IS HERE SET
FORTH AND I WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE MY SONS THAT THE SAME JUSTICE
WHICH PUNISHES SIN MAY ALSO MOST GRACIOUSLY FORGIVE IT AND THAT NO
BAN IS SO HEAVY BUT THAT BY PRAYER AND REPENTANCE IT MAY BE REMOVED
LEARN THEN FROM THIS STORY NOT TO FEAR THE FRUITS OF THE PAST BUT
RATHER TO BE CIRCUMSPECT IN THE FUTURE THAT THOSE FOUL PASSIONS
WHEREBY OUR FAMILY HAS SUFFERED SO GRIEVOUSLY MAY NOT AGAIN BE LOOSED
TO OUR UNDOING
KNOW THEN THAT IN THE TIME OF THE GREAT REBELLION THE HISTORY OF
WHICH BY THE LEARNED LORD CLARENDON I MOST EARNESTLY COMMEND TO YOUR
ATTENTION THIS MANOR OF BASKERVILLE WAS HELD BY HUGO OF THAT NAME
NOR CAN IT BE GAINSAID THAT HE WAS A MOST WILD PROFANE AND GODLESS
MAN THIS IN TRUTH HIS NEIGHBOURS MIGHT HAVE PARDONED SEEING THAT
SAINTS HAVE NEVER FLOURISHED IN THOSE PARTS BUT THERE WAS IN HIM A
CERTAIN WANTON AND CRUEL HUMOUR WHICH MADE HIS NAME A BYWORD THROUGH
THE WEST IT CHANCED THAT THIS HUGO CAME TO LOVE IF INDEED SO DARK
A PASSION MAY BE KNOWN UNDER SO BRIGHT A NAME THE DAUGHTER OF A
YEOMAN WHO HELD LANDS NEAR THE BASKERVILLE ESTATE BUT THE YOUNG
MAIDEN BEING DISCREET AND OF GOOD REPUTE WOULD EVER AVOID HIM FOR
SHE FEARED HIS EVIL NAME SO IT CAME TO PASS THAT ONE MICHAELMAS THIS
HUGO WITH FIVE OR SIX OF HIS IDLE AND WICKED COMPANIONS STOLE DOWN
UPON THE FARM AND CARRIED OFF THE MAIDEN HER FATHER AND BROTHERS
BEING FROM HOME AS HE WELL KNEW WHEN THEY HAD BROUGHT HER TO THE
HALL THE MAIDEN WAS PLACED IN AN UPPER CHAMBER WHILE HUGO AND HIS
FRIENDS SAT DOWN TO A LONG CAROUSE AS WAS THEIR NIGHTLY CUSTOM NOW
THE POOR LASS UPSTAIRS WAS LIKE TO HAVE HER WITS TURNED AT THE
SINGING AND SHOUTING AND TERRIBLE OATHS WHICH CAME UP TO HER FROM
BELOW FOR THEY SAY THAT THE WORDS USED BY HUGO BASKERVILLE WHEN HE
WAS IN WINE WERE SUCH AS MIGHT BLAST THE MAN WHO SAID THEM AT LAST
IN THE STRESS OF HER FEAR SHE DID THAT WHICH MIGHT HAVE DAUNTED THE
BRAVEST OR MOST ACTIVE MAN FOR BY THE AID OF THE GROWTH OF IVY WHICH
COVERED AND STILL COVERS THE SOUTH WALL SHE CAME DOWN FROM UNDER
THE EAVES AND SO HOMEWARD ACROSS THE MOOR THERE BEING THREE LEAGUES
BETWIXT THE HALL AND HER FATHERS FARM
IT CHANCED THAT SOME LITTLE TIME LATER HUGO LEFT HIS GUESTS TO CARRY
FOOD AND DRINKWITH OTHER WORSE THINGS PERCHANCETO HIS CAPTIVE
AND SO FOUND THE CAGE EMPTY AND THE BIRD ESCAPED THEN AS IT WOULD
SEEM HE BECAME AS ONE THAT HATH A DEVIL FOR RUSHING DOWN THE
STAIRS INTO THE DININGHALL HE SPRANG UPON THE GREAT TABLE FLAGONS
AND TRENCHERS FLYING BEFORE HIM AND HE CRIED ALOUD BEFORE ALL THE
COMPANY THAT HE WOULD THAT VERY NIGHT RENDER HIS BODY AND SOUL TO THE
POWERS OF EVIL IF HE MIGHT BUT OVERTAKE THE WENCH AND WHILE THE
REVELLERS STOOD AGHAST AT THE FURY OF THE MAN ONE MORE WICKED OR IT
MAY BE MORE DRUNKEN THAN THE REST CRIED OUT THAT THEY SHOULD PUT
THE HOUNDS UPON HER WHEREAT HUGO RAN FROM THE HOUSE CRYING TO HIS
GROOMS THAT THEY SHOULD SADDLE HIS MARE AND UNKENNEL THE PACK AND
GIVING THE HOUNDS A KERCHIEF OF THE MAIDS HE SWUNG THEM TO THE
LINE AND SO OFF FULL CRY IN THE MOONLIGHT OVER THE MOOR
NOW FOR SOME SPACE THE REVELLERS STOOD AGAPE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND
ALL THAT HAD BEEN DONE IN SUCH HASTE BUT ANON THEIR BEMUSED WITS
AWOKE TO THE NATURE OF THE DEED WHICH WAS LIKE TO BE DONE UPON THE
MOORLANDS EVERYTHING WAS NOW IN AN UPROAR SOME CALLING FOR THEIR
PISTOLS SOME FOR THEIR HORSES AND SOME FOR ANOTHER FLASK OF WINE
BUT AT LENGTH SOME SENSE CAME BACK TO THEIR CRAZED MINDS AND THE
WHOLE OF THEM THIRTEEN IN NUMBER TOOK HORSE AND STARTED IN PURSUIT
THE MOON SHONE CLEAR ABOVE THEM AND THEY RODE SWIFTLY ABREAST
TAKING THAT COURSE WHICH THE MAID MUST NEEDS HAVE TAKEN IF SHE WERE
TO REACH HER OWN HOME
THEY HAD GONE A MILE OR TWO WHEN THEY PASSED ONE OF THE NIGHT
SHEPHERDS UPON THE MOORLANDS AND THEY CRIED TO HIM TO KNOW IF HE HAD
SEEN THE HUNT AND THE MAN AS THE STORY GOES WAS SO CRAZED WITH
FEAR THAT HE COULD SCARCE SPEAK BUT AT LAST HE SAID THAT HE HAD
INDEED SEEN THE UNHAPPY MAIDEN WITH THE HOUNDS UPON HER TRACK BUT
I HAVE SEEN MORE THAN THAT SAID HE FOR HUGO BASKERVILLE PASSED ME
UPON HIS BLACK MARE AND THERE RAN MUTE BEHIND HIM SUCH A HOUND OF
HELL AS GOD FORBID SHOULD EVER BE AT MY HEELS SO THE DRUNKEN
SQUIRES CURSED THE SHEPHERD AND RODE ONWARD BUT SOON THEIR SKINS
TURNED COLD FOR THERE CAME A GALLOPING ACROSS THE MOOR AND THE
BLACK MARE DABBLED WITH WHITE FROTH WENT PAST WITH TRAILING BRIDLE
AND EMPTY SADDLE THEN THE REVELLERS RODE CLOSE TOGETHER FOR A GREAT
FEAR WAS ON THEM BUT THEY STILL FOLLOWED OVER THE MOOR THOUGH EACH
HAD HE BEEN ALONE WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT GLAD TO HAVE TURNED HIS
HORSES HEAD RIDING SLOWLY IN THIS FASHION THEY CAME AT LAST UPON
THE HOUNDS THESE THOUGH KNOWN FOR THEIR VALOUR AND THEIR BREED
WERE WHIMPERING IN A CLUSTER AT THE HEAD OF A DEEP DIP OR GOYAL AS
WE CALL IT UPON THE MOOR SOME SLINKING AWAY AND SOME WITH STARTING
HACKLES AND STARING EYES GAZING DOWN THE NARROW VALLEY BEFORE THEM
THE COMPANY HAD COME TO A HALT MORE SOBER MEN AS YOU MAY GUESS
THAN WHEN THEY STARTED THE MOST OF THEM WOULD BY NO MEANS ADVANCE
BUT THREE OF THEM THE BOLDEST OR IT MAY BE THE MOST DRUNKEN RODE
FORWARD DOWN THE GOYAL NOW IT OPENED INTO A BROAD SPACE IN WHICH
STOOD TWO OF THOSE GREAT STONES STILL TO BE SEEN THERE WHICH WERE
SET BY CERTAIN FORGOTTEN PEOPLES IN THE DAYS OF OLD THE MOON WAS
SHINING BRIGHT UPON THE CLEARING AND THERE IN THE CENTRE LAY THE
UNHAPPY MAID WHERE SHE HAD FALLEN DEAD OF FEAR AND OF FATIGUE BUT
IT WAS NOT THE SIGHT OF HER BODY NOR YET WAS IT THAT OF THE BODY OF
HUGO BASKERVILLE LYING NEAR HER WHICH RAISED THE HAIR UPON THE HEADS
OF THESE THREE DAREDEVIL ROYSTERERS BUT IT WAS THAT STANDING OVER
HUGO AND PLUCKING AT HIS THROAT THERE STOOD A FOUL THING A GREAT
BLACK BEAST SHAPED LIKE A HOUND YET LARGER THAN ANY HOUND THAT EVER
MORTAL EYE HAS RESTED UPON AND EVEN AS THEY LOOKED THE THING TORE
THE THROAT OUT OF HUGO BASKERVILLE ON WHICH AS IT TURNED ITS
BLAZING EYES AND DRIPPING JAWS UPON THEM THE THREE SHRIEKED WITH
FEAR AND RODE FOR DEAR LIFE STILL SCREAMING ACROSS THE MOOR ONE
IT IS SAID DIED THAT VERY NIGHT OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND THE OTHER
TWAIN WERE BUT BROKEN MEN FOR THE REST OF THEIR DAYS
SUCH IS THE TALE MY SONS OF THE COMING OF THE HOUND WHICH IS SAID
TO HAVE PLAGUED THE FAMILY SO SORELY EVER SINCE IF I HAVE SET IT
DOWN IT IS BECAUSE THAT WHICH IS CLEARLY KNOWN HATH LESS TERROR THAN
THAT WHICH IS BUT HINTED AT AND GUESSED NOR CAN IT BE DENIED THAT
MANY OF THE FAMILY HAVE BEEN UNHAPPY IN THEIR DEATHS WHICH HAVE BEEN
SUDDEN BLOODY AND MYSTERIOUS YET MAY WE SHELTER OURSELVES IN THE
INFINITE GOODNESS OF PROVIDENCE WHICH WOULD NOT FOREVER PUNISH THE
INNOCENT BEYOND THAT THIRD OR FOURTH GENERATION WHICH IS THREATENED
IN HOLY WRIT TO THAT PROVIDENCE MY SONS I HEREBY COMMEND YOU AND
I COUNSEL YOU BY WAY OF CAUTION TO FORBEAR FROM CROSSING THE MOOR IN
THOSE DARK HOURS WHEN THE POWERS OF EVIL ARE EXALTED
THIS FROM HUGO BASKERVILLE TO HIS SONS RODGER AND JOHN WITH
INSTRUCTIONS THAT THEY SAY NOTHING THEREOF TO THEIR SISTER
ELIZABETH
WHEN DR MORTIMER HAD FINISHED READING THIS SINGULAR NARRATIVE HE
PUSHED HIS SPECTACLES UP ON HIS FOREHEAD AND STARED ACROSS AT MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES THE LATTER YAWNED AND TOSSED THE END OF HIS
CIGARETTE INTO THE FIRE
WELL SAID HE
DO YOU NOT FIND IT INTERESTING
TO A COLLECTOR OF FAIRY TALES
DR MORTIMER DREW A FOLDED NEWSPAPER OUT OF HIS POCKET
NOW MR HOLMES WE WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE RECENT
THIS IS THE DEVON COUNTY CHRONICLE OF MAY TH OF THIS YEAR IT IS A
SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS ELICITED AT THE DEATH OF SIR CHARLES
BASKERVILLE WHICH OCCURRED A FEW DAYS BEFORE THAT DATE
MY FRIEND LEANED A LITTLE FORWARD AND HIS EXPRESSION BECAME INTENT
OUR VISITOR READJUSTED HIS GLASSES AND BEGAN
THE RECENT SUDDEN DEATH OF SIR CHARLES BASKERVILLE WHOSE NAME HAS
BEEN MENTIONED AS THE PROBABLE LIBERAL CANDIDATE FOR MIDDEVON AT THE
NEXT ELECTION HAS CAST A GLOOM OVER THE COUNTY THOUGH SIR CHARLES
HAD RESIDED AT BASKERVILLE HALL FOR A COMPARATIVELY SHORT PERIOD HIS
AMIABILITY OF CHARACTER AND EXTREME GENEROSITY HAD WON THE AFFECTION
AND RESPECT OF ALL WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH HIM IN
THESE DAYS OF NOUVEAUX RICHES IT IS REFRESHING TO FIND A CASE WHERE
THE SCION OF AN OLD COUNTY FAMILY WHICH HAS FALLEN UPON EVIL DAYS IS
ABLE TO MAKE HIS OWN FORTUNE AND TO BRING IT BACK WITH HIM TO RESTORE
THE FALLEN GRANDEUR OF HIS LINE SIR CHARLES AS IS WELL KNOWN MADE
LARGE SUMS OF MONEY IN SOUTH AFRICAN SPECULATION MORE WISE THAN
THOSE WHO GO ON UNTIL THE WHEEL TURNS AGAINST THEM HE REALIZED HIS
GAINS AND RETURNED TO ENGLAND WITH THEM IT IS ONLY TWO YEARS SINCE
HE TOOK UP HIS RESIDENCE AT BASKERVILLE HALL AND IT IS COMMON TALK
HOW LARGE WERE THOSE SCHEMES OF RECONSTRUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT WHICH
HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED BY HIS DEATH BEING HIMSELF CHILDLESS IT WAS
HIS OPENLY EXPRESSED DESIRE THAT THE WHOLE COUNTRYSIDE SHOULD
WITHIN HIS OWN LIFETIME PROFIT BY HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND MANY WILL
HAVE PERSONAL REASONS FOR BEWAILING HIS UNTIMELY END HIS GENEROUS
DONATIONS TO LOCAL AND COUNTY CHARITIES HAVE BEEN FREQUENTLY
CHRONICLED IN THESE COLUMNS
THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE DEATH OF SIR CHARLES CANNOT BE
SAID TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY CLEARED UP BY THE INQUEST BUT AT LEAST
ENOUGH HAS BEEN DONE TO DISPOSE OF THOSE RUMOURS TO WHICH LOCAL
SUPERSTITION HAS GIVEN RISE THERE IS NO REASON WHATEVER TO SUSPECT
FOUL PLAY OR TO IMAGINE THAT DEATH COULD BE FROM ANY BUT NATURAL
CAUSES SIR CHARLES WAS A WIDOWER AND A MAN WHO MAY BE SAID TO HAVE
BEEN IN SOME WAYS OF AN ECCENTRIC HABIT OF MIND IN SPITE OF HIS
CONSIDERABLE WEALTH HE WAS SIMPLE IN HIS PERSONAL TASTES AND HIS
INDOOR SERVANTS AT BASKERVILLE HALL CONSISTED OF A MARRIED COUPLE
NAMED BARRYMORE THE HUSBAND ACTING AS BUTLER AND THE WIFE AS
HOUSEKEEPER THEIR EVIDENCE CORROBORATED BY THAT OF SEVERAL FRIENDS
TENDS TO SHOW THAT SIR CHARLESS HEALTH HAS FOR SOME TIME BEEN
IMPAIRED AND POINTS ESPECIALLY TO SOME AFFECTION OF THE HEART
MANIFESTING ITSELF IN CHANGES OF COLOUR BREATHLESSNESS AND ACUTE
ATTACKS OF NERVOUS DEPRESSION DR JAMES MORTIMER THE FRIEND AND
MEDICAL ATTENDANT OF THE DECEASED HAS GIVEN EVIDENCE TO THE SAME
EFFECT
THE FACTS OF THE CASE ARE SIMPLE SIR CHARLES BASKERVILLE WAS IN THE
HABIT EVERY NIGHT BEFORE GOING TO BED OF WALKING DOWN THE FAMOUS YEW
ALLEY OF BASKERVILLE HALL THE EVIDENCE OF THE BARRYMORES SHOWS THAT
THIS HAD BEEN HIS CUSTOM ON THE TH OF MAY SIR CHARLES HAD DECLARED
HIS INTENTION OF STARTING NEXT DAY FOR LONDON AND HAD ORDERED
BARRYMORE TO PREPARE HIS LUGGAGE THAT NIGHT HE WENT OUT AS USUAL FOR
HIS NOCTURNAL WALK IN THE COURSE OF WHICH HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF
SMOKING A CIGAR HE NEVER RETURNED AT TWELVE OCLOCK BARRYMORE
FINDING THE HALL DOOR STILL OPEN BECAME ALARMED AND LIGHTING A
LANTERN WENT IN SEARCH OF HIS MASTER THE DAY HAD BEEN WET AND SIR
CHARLESS FOOTMARKS WERE EASILY TRACED DOWN THE ALLEY HALFWAY DOWN
THIS WALK THERE IS A GATE WHICH LEADS OUT ON TO THE MOOR THERE WERE
INDICATIONS THAT SIR CHARLES HAD STOOD FOR SOME LITTLE TIME HERE HE
THEN PROCEEDED DOWN THE ALLEY AND IT WAS AT THE FAR END OF IT THAT
HIS BODY WAS DISCOVERED ONE FACT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN EXPLAINED IS THE
STATEMENT OF BARRYMORE THAT HIS MASTERS FOOTPRINTS ALTERED THEIR
CHARACTER FROM THE TIME THAT HE PASSED THE MOORGATE AND THAT HE
APPEARED FROM THENCE ONWARD TO HAVE BEEN WALKING UPON HIS TOES ONE
MURPHY A GIPSY HORSEDEALER WAS ON THE MOOR AT NO GREAT DISTANCE AT
THE TIME BUT HE APPEARS BY HIS OWN CONFESSION TO HAVE BEEN THE WORSE
FOR DRINK HE DECLARES THAT HE HEARD CRIES BUT IS UNABLE TO STATE
FROM WHAT DIRECTION THEY CAME NO SIGNS OF VIOLENCE WERE TO BE
DISCOVERED UPON SIR CHARLESS PERSON AND THOUGH THE DOCTORS
EVIDENCE POINTED TO AN ALMOST INCREDIBLE FACIAL DISTORTIONSO GREAT
THAT DR MORTIMER REFUSED AT FIRST TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS INDEED HIS
FRIEND AND PATIENT WHO LAY BEFORE HIMIT WAS EXPLAINED THAT THAT IS
A SYMPTOM WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL IN CASES OF DYSPNOEA AND DEATH FROM
CARDIAC EXHAUSTION THIS EXPLANATION WAS BORNE OUT BY THE POSTMORTEM
EXAMINATION WHICH SHOWED LONGSTANDING ORGANIC DISEASE AND THE
CORONERS JURY RETURNED A VERDICT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MEDICAL
EVIDENCE IT IS WELL THAT THIS IS SO FOR IT IS OBVIOUSLY OF THE
UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT SIR CHARLESS HEIR SHOULD SETTLE AT THE HALL
AND CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK WHICH HAS BEEN SO SADLY INTERRUPTED HAD
THE PROSAIC FINDING OF THE CORONER NOT FINALLY PUT AN END TO THE
ROMANTIC STORIES WHICH HAVE BEEN WHISPERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE
AFFAIR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO FIND A TENANT FOR BASKERVILLE
HALL IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE NEXT OF KIN IS MR HENRY BASKERVILLE
IF HE BE STILL ALIVE THE SON OF SIR CHARLES BASKERVILLES YOUNGER
BROTHER THE YOUNG MAN WHEN LAST HEARD OF WAS IN AMERICA AND
INQUIRIES ARE BEING INSTITUTED WITH A VIEW TO INFORMING HIM OF HIS
GOOD FORTUNE
DR MORTIMER REFOLDED HIS PAPER AND REPLACED IT IN HIS POCKET
THOSE ARE THE PUBLIC FACTS MR HOLMES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEATH
OF SIR CHARLES BASKERVILLE
I MUST THANK YOU SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR CALLING MY ATTENTION
TO A CASE WHICH CERTAINLY PRESENTS SOME FEATURES OF INTEREST I HAD
OBSERVED SOME NEWSPAPER COMMENT AT THE TIME BUT I WAS EXCEEDINGLY
PREOCCUPIED BY THAT LITTLE AFFAIR OF THE VATICAN CAMEOS AND IN MY
ANXIETY TO OBLIGE THE POPE I LOST TOUCH WITH SEVERAL INTERESTING
ENGLISH CASES THIS ARTICLE YOU SAY CONTAINS ALL THE PUBLIC FACTS
IT DOES
THEN LET ME HAVE THE PRIVATE ONES HE LEANED BACK PUT HIS
FINGERTIPS TOGETHER AND ASSUMED HIS MOST IMPASSIVE AND JUDICIAL
EXPRESSION
IN DOING SO SAID DR MORTIMER WHO HAD BEGUN TO SHOW SIGNS OF SOME
STRONG EMOTION I AM TELLING THAT WHICH I HAVE NOT CONFIDED TO
ANYONE MY MOTIVE FOR WITHHOLDING IT FROM THE CORONERS INQUIRY IS
THAT A MAN OF SCIENCE SHRINKS FROM PLACING HIMSELF IN THE PUBLIC
POSITION OF SEEMING TO INDORSE A POPULAR SUPERSTITION I HAD THE
FURTHER MOTIVE THAT BASKERVILLE HALL AS THE PAPER SAYS WOULD
CERTAINLY REMAIN UNTENANTED IF ANYTHING WERE DONE TO INCREASE ITS
ALREADY RATHER GRIM REPUTATION FOR BOTH THESE REASONS I THOUGHT THAT
I WAS JUSTIFIED IN TELLING RATHER LESS THAN I KNEW SINCE NO
PRACTICAL GOOD COULD RESULT FROM IT BUT WITH YOU THERE IS NO REASON
WHY I SHOULD NOT BE PERFECTLY FRANK
THE MOOR IS VERY SPARSELY INHABITED AND THOSE WHO LIVE NEAR EACH
OTHER ARE THROWN VERY MUCH TOGETHER FOR THIS REASON I SAW A GOOD
DEAL OF SIR CHARLES BASKERVILLE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MR FRANKLAND
OF LAFTER HALL AND MR STAPLETON THE NATURALIST THERE ARE NO OTHER
MEN OF EDUCATION WITHIN MANY MILES SIR CHARLES WAS A RETIRING MAN
BUT THE CHANCE OF HIS ILLNESS BROUGHT US TOGETHER AND A COMMUNITY OF
INTERESTS IN SCIENCE KEPT US SO HE HAD BROUGHT BACK MUCH SCIENTIFIC
INFORMATION FROM SOUTH AFRICA AND MANY A CHARMING EVENING WE HAVE
SPENT TOGETHER DISCUSSING THE COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE BUSHMAN AND
THE HOTTENTOT
WITHIN THE LAST FEW MONTHS IT BECAME INCREASINGLY PLAIN TO ME THAT
SIR CHARLESS NERVOUS SYSTEM WAS STRAINED TO THE BREAKING POINT HE
HAD TAKEN THIS LEGEND WHICH I HAVE READ YOU EXCEEDINGLY TO HEARTSO
MUCH SO THAT ALTHOUGH HE WOULD WALK IN HIS OWN GROUNDS NOTHING
WOULD INDUCE HIM TO GO OUT UPON THE MOOR AT NIGHT INCREDIBLE AS IT
MAY APPEAR TO YOU MR HOLMES HE WAS HONESTLY CONVINCED THAT A
DREADFUL FATE OVERHUNG HIS FAMILY AND CERTAINLY THE RECORDS WHICH HE
WAS ABLE TO GIVE OF HIS ANCESTORS WERE NOT ENCOURAGING THE IDEA OF
SOME GHASTLY PRESENCE CONSTANTLY HAUNTED HIM AND ON MORE THAN ONE
OCCASION HE HAS ASKED ME WHETHER I HAD ON MY MEDICAL JOURNEYS AT
NIGHT EVER SEEN ANY STRANGE CREATURE OR HEARD THE BAYING OF A HOUND
THE LATTER QUESTION HE PUT TO ME SEVERAL TIMES AND ALWAYS WITH A
VOICE WHICH VIBRATED WITH EXCITEMENT
I CAN WELL REMEMBER DRIVING UP TO HIS HOUSE IN THE EVENING SOME
THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE FATAL EVENT HE CHANCED TO BE AT HIS HALL
DOOR I HAD DESCENDED FROM MY GIG AND WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM
WHEN I SAW HIS EYES FIX THEMSELVES OVER MY SHOULDER AND STARE PAST
ME WITH AN EXPRESSION OF THE MOST DREADFUL HORROR I WHISKED ROUND
AND HAD JUST TIME TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF SOMETHING WHICH I TOOK TO BE
A LARGE BLACK CALF PASSING AT THE HEAD OF THE DRIVE SO EXCITED AND
ALARMED WAS HE THAT I WAS COMPELLED TO GO DOWN TO THE SPOT WHERE THE
ANIMAL HAD BEEN AND LOOK AROUND FOR IT IT WAS GONE HOWEVER AND THE
INCIDENT APPEARED TO MAKE THE WORST IMPRESSION UPON HIS MIND I
STAYED WITH HIM ALL THE EVENING AND IT WAS ON THAT OCCASION TO
EXPLAIN THE EMOTION WHICH HE HAD SHOWN THAT HE CONFIDED TO MY
KEEPING THAT NARRATIVE WHICH I READ TO YOU WHEN FIRST I CAME I
MENTION THIS SMALL EPISODE BECAUSE IT ASSUMES SOME IMPORTANCE IN VIEW
OF THE TRAGEDY WHICH FOLLOWED BUT I WAS CONVINCED AT THE TIME THAT
THE MATTER WAS ENTIRELY TRIVIAL AND THAT HIS EXCITEMENT HAD NO
JUSTIFICATION
IT WAS AT MY ADVICE THAT SIR CHARLES WAS ABOUT TO GO TO LONDON HIS
HEART WAS I KNEW AFFECTED AND THE CONSTANT ANXIETY IN WHICH HE
LIVED HOWEVER CHIMERICAL THE CAUSE OF IT MIGHT BE WAS EVIDENTLY
HAVING A SERIOUS EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH I THOUGHT THAT A FEW MONTHS
AMONG THE DISTRACTIONS OF TOWN WOULD SEND HIM BACK A NEW MAN MR
STAPLETON A MUTUAL FRIEND WHO WAS MUCH CONCERNED AT HIS STATE OF
HEALTH WAS OF THE SAME OPINION AT THE LAST INSTANT CAME THIS
TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE
ON THE NIGHT OF SIR CHARLESS DEATH BARRYMORE THE BUTLER WHO MADE
THE DISCOVERY SENT PERKINS THE GROOM ON HORSEBACK TO ME AND AS I
WAS SITTING UP LATE I WAS ABLE TO REACH BASKERVILLE HALL WITHIN AN
HOUR OF THE EVENT I CHECKED AND CORROBORATED ALL THE FACTS WHICH
WERE MENTIONED AT THE INQUEST I FOLLOWED THE FOOTSTEPS DOWN THE YEW
ALLEY I SAW THE SPOT AT THE MOORGATE WHERE HE SEEMED TO HAVE
WAITED I REMARKED THE CHANGE IN THE SHAPE OF THE PRINTS AFTER THAT
POINT I NOTED THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER FOOTSTEPS SAVE THOSE OF
BARRYMORE ON THE SOFT GRAVEL AND FINALLY I CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE
BODY WHICH HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED UNTIL MY ARRIVAL SIR CHARLES LAY ON
HIS FACE HIS ARMS OUT HIS FINGERS DUG INTO THE GROUND AND HIS
FEATURES CONVULSED WITH SOME STRONG EMOTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT I
COULD HARDLY HAVE SWORN TO HIS IDENTITY THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO
PHYSICAL INJURY OF ANY KIND BUT ONE FALSE STATEMENT WAS MADE BY
BARRYMORE AT THE INQUEST HE SAID THAT THERE WERE NO TRACES UPON THE
GROUND ROUND THE BODY HE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY BUT I DIDSOME LITTLE
DISTANCE OFF BUT FRESH AND CLEAR
FOOTPRINTS
FOOTPRINTS
A MANS OR A WOMANS
DR MORTIMER LOOKED STRANGELY AT US FOR AN INSTANT AND HIS VOICE
SANK ALMOST TO A WHISPER AS HE ANSWERED
MR HOLMES THEY WERE THE FOOTPRINTS OF A GIGANTIC HOUND
CHAPTER III
THE PROBLEM
I CONFESS AT THESE WORDS A SHUDDER PASSED THROUGH ME THERE WAS A
THRILL IN THE DOCTORS VOICE WHICH SHOWED THAT HE WAS HIMSELF DEEPLY
MOVED BY THAT WHICH HE TOLD US HOLMES LEANED FORWARD IN HIS
EXCITEMENT AND HIS EYES HAD THE HARD DRY GLITTER WHICH SHOT FROM
THEM WHEN HE WAS KEENLY INTERESTED
YOU SAW THIS
AS CLEARLY AS I SEE YOU
AND YOU SAID NOTHING
WHAT WAS THE USE
HOW WAS IT THAT NO ONE ELSE SAW IT
THE MARKS WERE SOME TWENTY YARDS FROM THE BODY AND NO ONE GAVE THEM
A THOUGHT I DONT SUPPOSE I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD I NOT KNOWN THIS
LEGEND
THERE ARE MANY SHEEPDOGS ON THE MOOR
NO DOUBT BUT THIS WAS NO SHEEPDOG
YOU SAY IT WAS LARGE
ENORMOUS
BUT IT HAD NOT APPROACHED THE BODY
NO
WHAT SORT OF NIGHT WAS IT
DAMP AND RAW
BUT NOT ACTUALLY RAINING
NO
WHAT IS THE ALLEY LIKE
THERE ARE TWO LINES OF OLD YEW HEDGE TWELVE FEET HIGH AND
IMPENETRABLE THE WALK IN THE CENTRE IS ABOUT EIGHT FEET ACROSS
IS THERE ANYTHING BETWEEN THE HEDGES AND THE WALK
YES THERE IS A STRIP OF GRASS ABOUT SIX FEET BROAD ON EITHER SIDE
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE YEW HEDGE IS PENETRATED AT ONE POINT BY A
GATE
YES THE WICKETGATE WHICH LEADS ON TO THE MOOR
IS THERE ANY OTHER OPENING
NONE
SO THAT TO REACH THE YEW ALLEY ONE EITHER HAS TO COME DOWN IT FROM
THE HOUSE OR ELSE TO ENTER IT BY THE MOORGATE
THERE IS AN EXIT THROUGH A SUMMERHOUSE AT THE FAR END
HAD SIR CHARLES REACHED THIS
NO HE LAY ABOUT FIFTY YARDS FROM IT
NOW TELL ME DR MORTIMERAND THIS IS IMPORTANTTHE MARKS WHICH
YOU SAW WERE ON THE PATH AND NOT ON THE GRASS
NO MARKS COULD SHOW ON THE GRASS
WERE THEY ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE PATH AS THE MOORGATE
YES THEY WERE ON THE EDGE OF THE PATH ON THE SAME SIDE AS THE
MOORGATE
YOU INTEREST ME EXCEEDINGLY ANOTHER POINT WAS THE WICKETGATE
CLOSED
CLOSED AND PADLOCKED
HOW HIGH WAS IT
ABOUT FOUR FEET HIGH
THEN ANYONE COULD HAVE GOT OVER IT
YES
AND WHAT MARKS DID YOU SEE BY THE WICKETGATE
NONE IN PARTICULAR
GOOD HEAVEN DID NO ONE EXAMINE
YES I EXAMINED MYSELF
AND FOUND NOTHING
IT WAS ALL VERY CONFUSED SIR CHARLES HAD EVIDENTLY STOOD THERE FOR
FIVE OR TEN MINUTES
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
BECAUSE THE ASH HAD TWICE DROPPED FROM HIS CIGAR
EXCELLENT THIS IS A COLLEAGUE WATSON AFTER OUR OWN HEART BUT THE
MARKS
HE HAD LEFT HIS OWN MARKS ALL OVER THAT SMALL PATCH OF GRAVEL I
COULD DISCERN NO OTHERS
SHERLOCK HOLMES STRUCK HIS HAND AGAINST HIS KNEE WITH AN IMPATIENT
GESTURE
IF I HAD ONLY BEEN THERE HE CRIED IT IS EVIDENTLY A CASE OF
EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST AND ONE WHICH PRESENTED IMMENSE OPPORTUNITIES
TO THE SCIENTIFIC EXPERT THAT GRAVEL PAGE UPON WHICH I MIGHT HAVE
READ SO MUCH HAS BEEN LONG ERE THIS SMUDGED BY THE RAIN AND DEFACED
BY THE CLOGS OF CURIOUS PEASANTS OH DR MORTIMER DR MORTIMER TO
THINK THAT YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE CALLED ME IN YOU HAVE INDEED MUCH TO
ANSWER FOR
I COULD NOT CALL YOU IN MR HOLMES WITHOUT DISCLOSING THESE FACTS
TO THE WORLD AND I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN MY REASONS FOR NOT WISHING TO
DO SO BESIDES BESIDES
WHY DO YOU HESITATE
THERE IS A REALM IN WHICH THE MOST ACUTE AND MOST EXPERIENCED OF
DETECTIVES IS HELPLESS
YOU MEAN THAT THE THING IS SUPERNATURAL
I DID NOT POSITIVELY SAY SO
NO BUT YOU EVIDENTLY THINK IT
SINCE THE TRAGEDY MR HOLMES THERE HAVE COME TO MY EARS SEVERAL
INCIDENTS WHICH ARE HARD TO RECONCILE WITH THE SETTLED ORDER OF
NATURE
FOR EXAMPLE
I FIND THAT BEFORE THE TERRIBLE EVENT OCCURRED SEVERAL PEOPLE HAD
SEEN A CREATURE UPON THE MOOR WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH THIS BASKERVILLE
DEMON AND WHICH COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE ANY ANIMAL KNOWN TO SCIENCE
THEY ALL AGREED THAT IT WAS A HUGE CREATURE LUMINOUS GHASTLY AND
SPECTRAL I HAVE CROSSEXAMINED THESE MEN ONE OF THEM A HARDHEADED
COUNTRYMAN ONE A FARRIER AND ONE A MOORLAND FARMER WHO ALL TELL
THE SAME STORY OF THIS DREADFUL APPARITION EXACTLY CORRESPONDING TO
THE HELLHOUND OF THE LEGEND I ASSURE YOU THAT THERE IS A REIGN OF
TERROR IN THE DISTRICT AND THAT IT IS A HARDY MAN WHO WILL CROSS THE
MOOR AT NIGHT
AND YOU A TRAINED MAN OF SCIENCE BELIEVE IT TO BE SUPERNATURAL
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE
HOLMES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
I HAVE HITHERTO CONFINED MY INVESTIGATIONS TO THIS WORLD SAID HE
IN A MODEST WAY I HAVE COMBATED EVIL BUT TO TAKE ON THE FATHER OF
EVIL HIMSELF WOULD PERHAPS BE TOO AMBITIOUS A TASK YET YOU MUST
ADMIT THAT THE FOOTMARK IS MATERIAL
THE ORIGINAL HOUND WAS MATERIAL ENOUGH TO TUG A MANS THROAT OUT
AND YET HE WAS DIABOLICAL AS WELL
I SEE THAT YOU HAVE QUITE GONE OVER TO THE SUPERNATURALISTS BUT
NOW DR MORTIMER TELL ME THIS IF YOU HOLD THESE VIEWS WHY HAVE
YOU COME TO CONSULT ME AT ALL YOU TELL ME IN THE SAME BREATH THAT IT
IS USELESS TO INVESTIGATE SIR CHARLESS DEATH AND THAT YOU DESIRE ME
TO DO IT
I DID NOT SAY THAT I DESIRED YOU TO DO IT
THEN HOW CAN I ASSIST YOU
BY ADVISING ME AS TO WHAT I SHOULD DO WITH SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE
WHO ARRIVES AT WATERLOO STATIONDR MORTIMER LOOKED AT HIS
WATCHIN EXACTLY ONE HOUR AND A QUARTER
HE BEING THE HEIR
YES ON THE DEATH OF SIR CHARLES WE INQUIRED FOR THIS YOUNG
GENTLEMAN AND FOUND THAT HE HAD BEEN FARMING IN CANADA FROM THE
ACCOUNTS WHICH HAVE REACHED US HE IS AN EXCELLENT FELLOW IN EVERY
WAY I SPEAK NOT AS A MEDICAL MAN BUT AS A TRUSTEE AND EXECUTOR OF
SIR CHARLESS WILL
THERE IS NO OTHER CLAIMANT I PRESUME
NONE THE ONLY OTHER KINSMAN WHOM WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TRACE WAS
RODGER BASKERVILLE THE YOUNGEST OF THREE BROTHERS OF WHOM POOR SIR
CHARLES WAS THE ELDER THE SECOND BROTHER WHO DIED YOUNG IS THE
FATHER OF THIS LAD HENRY THE THIRD RODGER WAS THE BLACK SHEEP OF
THE FAMILY HE CAME OF THE OLD MASTERFUL BASKERVILLE STRAIN AND WAS
THE VERY IMAGE THEY TELL ME OF THE FAMILY PICTURE OF OLD HUGO HE
MADE ENGLAND TOO HOT TO HOLD HIM FLED TO CENTRAL AMERICA AND DIED
THERE IN OF YELLOW FEVER HENRY IS THE LAST OF THE BASKERVILLES
IN ONE HOUR AND FIVE MINUTES I MEET HIM AT WATERLOO STATION I HAVE
HAD A WIRE THAT HE ARRIVED AT SOUTHAMPTON THIS MORNING NOW MR
HOLMES WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE ME TO DO WITH HIM
WHY SHOULD HE NOT GO TO THE HOME OF HIS FATHERS
IT SEEMS NATURAL DOES IT NOT AND YET CONSIDER THAT EVERY
BASKERVILLE WHO GOES THERE MEETS WITH AN EVIL FATE I FEEL SURE THAT
IF SIR CHARLES COULD HAVE SPOKEN WITH ME BEFORE HIS DEATH HE WOULD
HAVE WARNED ME AGAINST BRINGING THIS THE LAST OF THE OLD RACE AND
THE HEIR TO GREAT WEALTH TO THAT DEADLY PLACE AND YET IT CANNOT BE
DENIED THAT THE PROSPERITY OF THE WHOLE POOR BLEAK COUNTRYSIDE
DEPENDS UPON HIS PRESENCE ALL THE GOOD WORK WHICH HAS BEEN DONE BY
SIR CHARLES WILL CRASH TO THE GROUND IF THERE IS NO TENANT OF THE
HALL I FEAR LEST I SHOULD BE SWAYED TOO MUCH BY MY OWN OBVIOUS
INTEREST IN THE MATTER AND THAT IS WHY I BRING THE CASE BEFORE YOU
AND ASK FOR YOUR ADVICE
HOLMES CONSIDERED FOR A LITTLE TIME
PUT INTO PLAIN WORDS THE MATTER IS THIS SAID HE IN YOUR OPINION
THERE IS A DIABOLICAL AGENCY WHICH MAKES DARTMOOR AN UNSAFE ABODE FOR
A BASKERVILLETHAT IS YOUR OPINION
AT LEAST I MIGHT GO THE LENGTH OF SAYING THAT THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE
THAT THIS MAY BE SO
EXACTLY BUT SURELY IF YOUR SUPERNATURAL THEORY BE CORRECT IT
COULD WORK THE YOUNG MAN EVIL IN LONDON AS EASILY AS IN DEVONSHIRE A
DEVIL WITH MERELY LOCAL POWERS LIKE A PARISH VESTRY WOULD BE TOO
INCONCEIVABLE A THING
YOU PUT THE MATTER MORE FLIPPANTLY MR HOLMES THAN YOU WOULD
PROBABLY DO IF YOU WERE BROUGHT INTO PERSONAL CONTACT WITH THESE
THINGS YOUR ADVICE THEN AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS THAT THE YOUNG MAN
WILL BE AS SAFE IN DEVONSHIRE AS IN LONDON HE COMES IN FIFTY
MINUTES WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND
I RECOMMEND SIR THAT YOU TAKE A CAB CALL OFF YOUR SPANIEL WHO IS
SCRATCHING AT MY FRONT DOOR AND PROCEED TO WATERLOO TO MEET SIR
HENRY BASKERVILLE
AND THEN
AND THEN YOU WILL SAY NOTHING TO HIM AT ALL UNTIL I HAVE MADE UP MY
MIND ABOUT THE MATTER
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND
TWENTYFOUR HOURS AT TEN OCLOCK TOMORROW DR MORTIMER I WILL BE
MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU IF YOU WILL CALL UPON ME HERE AND IT WILL BE OF
HELP TO ME IN MY PLANS FOR THE FUTURE IF YOU WILL BRING SIR HENRY
BASKERVILLE WITH YOU
I WILL DO SO MR HOLMES HE SCRIBBLED THE APPOINTMENT ON HIS
SHIRTCUFF AND HURRIED OFF IN HIS STRANGE PEERING ABSENTMINDED
FASHION HOLMES STOPPED HIM AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIR
ONLY ONE MORE QUESTION DR MORTIMER YOU SAY THAT BEFORE SIR
CHARLES BASKERVILLES DEATH SEVERAL PEOPLE SAW THIS APPARITION UPON
THE MOOR
THREE PEOPLE DID
DID ANY SEE IT AFTER
I HAVE NOT HEARD OF ANY
THANK YOU GOOD MORNING
HOLMES RETURNED TO HIS SEAT WITH THAT QUIET LOOK OF INWARD
SATISFACTION WHICH MEANT THAT HE HAD A CONGENIAL TASK BEFORE HIM
GOING OUT WATSON
UNLESS I CAN HELP YOU
NO MY DEAR FELLOW IT IS AT THE HOUR OF ACTION THAT I TURN TO YOU
FOR AID BUT THIS IS SPLENDID REALLY UNIQUE FROM SOME POINTS OF
VIEW WHEN YOU PASS BRADLEYS WOULD YOU ASK HIM TO SEND UP A POUND
OF THE STRONGEST SHAG TOBACCO THANK YOU IT WOULD BE AS WELL IF YOU
COULD MAKE IT CONVENIENT NOT TO RETURN BEFORE EVENING THEN I SHOULD
BE VERY GLAD TO COMPARE IMPRESSIONS AS TO THIS MOST INTERESTING
PROBLEM WHICH HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO US THIS MORNING
I KNEW THAT SECLUSION AND SOLITUDE WERE VERY NECESSARY FOR MY FRIEND
IN THOSE HOURS OF INTENSE MENTAL CONCENTRATION DURING WHICH HE
WEIGHED EVERY PARTICLE OF EVIDENCE CONSTRUCTED ALTERNATIVE THEORIES
BALANCED ONE AGAINST THE OTHER AND MADE UP HIS MIND AS TO WHICH
POINTS WERE ESSENTIAL AND WHICH IMMATERIAL I THEREFORE SPENT THE DAY
AT MY CLUB AND DID NOT RETURN TO BAKER STREET UNTIL EVENING IT WAS
NEARLY NINE OCLOCK WHEN I FOUND MYSELF IN THE SITTINGROOM ONCE
MORE
MY FIRST IMPRESSION AS I OPENED THE DOOR WAS THAT A FIRE HAD BROKEN
OUT FOR THE ROOM WAS SO FILLED WITH SMOKE THAT THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP
UPON THE TABLE WAS BLURRED BY IT AS I ENTERED HOWEVER MY FEARS
WERE SET AT REST FOR IT WAS THE ACRID FUMES OF STRONG COARSE TOBACCO
WHICH TOOK ME BY THE THROAT AND SET ME COUGHING THROUGH THE HAZE I
HAD A VAGUE VISION OF HOLMES IN HIS DRESSINGGOWN COILED UP IN AN
ARMCHAIR WITH HIS BLACK CLAY PIPE BETWEEN HIS LIPS SEVERAL ROLLS OF
PAPER LAY AROUND HIM
CAUGHT COLD WATSON SAID HE
NO ITS THIS POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE
I SUPPOSE IT IS PRETTY THICK NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT
THICK IT IS INTOLERABLE
OPEN THE WINDOW THEN YOU HAVE BEEN AT YOUR CLUB ALL DAY I
PERCEIVE
MY DEAR HOLMES
AM I RIGHT
CERTAINLY BUT HOW
HE LAUGHED AT MY BEWILDERED EXPRESSION
THERE IS A DELIGHTFUL FRESHNESS ABOUT YOU WATSON WHICH MAKES IT A
PLEASURE TO EXERCISE ANY SMALL POWERS WHICH I POSSESS AT YOUR
EXPENSE A GENTLEMAN GOES FORTH ON A SHOWERY AND MIRY DAY HE RETURNS
IMMACULATE IN THE EVENING WITH THE GLOSS STILL ON HIS HAT AND HIS
BOOTS HE HAS BEEN A FIXTURE THEREFORE ALL DAY HE IS NOT A MAN WITH
INTIMATE FRIENDS WHERE THEN COULD HE HAVE BEEN IS IT NOT
OBVIOUS
WELL IT IS RATHER OBVIOUS
THE WORLD IS FULL OF OBVIOUS THINGS WHICH NOBODY BY ANY CHANCE EVER
OBSERVES WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT I HAVE BEEN
A FIXTURE ALSO
ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE BEEN TO DEVONSHIRE
IN SPIRIT
EXACTLY MY BODY HAS REMAINED IN THIS ARMCHAIR AND HAS I REGRET TO
OBSERVE CONSUMED IN MY ABSENCE TWO LARGE POTS OF COFFEE AND AN
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF TOBACCO AFTER YOU LEFT I SENT DOWN TO
STAMFORDS FOR THE ORDNANCE MAP OF THIS PORTION OF THE MOOR AND MY
SPIRIT HAS HOVERED OVER IT ALL DAY I FLATTER MYSELF THAT I COULD
FIND MY WAY ABOUT
A LARGE SCALE MAP I PRESUME
VERY LARGE HE UNROLLED ONE SECTION AND HELD IT OVER HIS KNEE
HERE YOU HAVE THE PARTICULAR DISTRICT WHICH CONCERNS US THAT IS
BASKERVILLE HALL IN THE MIDDLE
WITH A WOOD ROUND IT
EXACTLY I FANCY THE YEW ALLEY THOUGH NOT MARKED UNDER THAT NAME
MUST STRETCH ALONG THIS LINE WITH THE MOOR AS YOU PERCEIVE UPON
THE RIGHT OF IT THIS SMALL CLUMP OF BUILDINGS HERE IS THE HAMLET OF
GRIMPEN WHERE OUR FRIEND DR MORTIMER HAS HIS HEADQUARTERS WITHIN A
RADIUS OF FIVE MILES THERE ARE AS YOU SEE ONLY A VERY FEW SCATTERED
DWELLINGS HERE IS LAFTER HALL WHICH WAS MENTIONED IN THE NARRATIVE
THERE IS A HOUSE INDICATED HERE WHICH MAY BE THE RESIDENCE OF THE
NATURALISTSTAPLETON IF I REMEMBER RIGHT WAS HIS NAME HERE ARE
TWO MOORLAND FARMHOUSES HIGH TOR AND FOULMIRE THEN FOURTEEN MILES
AWAY THE GREAT CONVICT PRISON OF PRINCETOWN BETWEEN AND AROUND THESE
SCATTERED POINTS EXTENDS THE DESOLATE LIFELESS MOOR THIS THEN IS
THE STAGE UPON WHICH TRAGEDY HAS BEEN PLAYED AND UPON WHICH WE MAY
HELP TO PLAY IT AGAIN
IT MUST BE A WILD PLACE
YES THE SETTING IS A WORTHY ONE IF THE DEVIL DID DESIRE TO HAVE A
HAND IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN
THEN YOU ARE YOURSELF INCLINING TO THE SUPERNATURAL EXPLANATION
THE DEVILS AGENTS MAY BE OF FLESH AND BLOOD MAY THEY NOT THERE
ARE TWO QUESTIONS WAITING FOR US AT THE OUTSET THE ONE IS WHETHER
ANY CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED AT ALL THE SECOND IS WHAT IS THE CRIME
AND HOW WAS IT COMMITTED OF COURSE IF DR MORTIMERS SURMISE SHOULD
BE CORRECT AND WE ARE DEALING WITH FORCES OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY LAWS
OF NATURE THERE IS AN END OF OUR INVESTIGATION BUT WE ARE BOUND TO
EXHAUST ALL OTHER HYPOTHESES BEFORE FALLING BACK UPON THIS ONE I
THINK WELL SHUT THAT WINDOW AGAIN IF YOU DONT MIND IT IS A
SINGULAR THING BUT I FIND THAT A CONCENTRATED ATMOSPHERE HELPS A
CONCENTRATION OF THOUGHT I HAVE NOT PUSHED IT TO THE LENGTH OF
GETTING INTO A BOX TO THINK BUT THAT IS THE LOGICAL OUTCOME OF MY
CONVICTIONS HAVE YOU TURNED THE CASE OVER IN YOUR MIND
YES I HAVE THOUGHT A GOOD DEAL OF IT IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
IT IS VERY BEWILDERING
IT HAS CERTAINLY A CHARACTER OF ITS OWN THERE ARE POINTS OF
DISTINCTION ABOUT IT THAT CHANGE IN THE FOOTPRINTS FOR EXAMPLE
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT
MORTIMER SAID THAT THE MAN HAD WALKED ON TIPTOE DOWN THAT PORTION OF
THE ALLEY
HE ONLY REPEATED WHAT SOME FOOL HAD SAID AT THE INQUEST WHY SHOULD
A MAN WALK ON TIPTOE DOWN THE ALLEY
WHAT THEN
HE WAS RUNNING WATSONRUNNING DESPERATELY RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE
RUNNING UNTIL HE BURST HIS HEART AND FELL DEAD UPON HIS FACE
RUNNING FROM WHAT
THERE LIES OUR PROBLEM THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THE MAN WAS
CRAZED WITH FEAR BEFORE EVER HE BEGAN TO RUN
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT
I AM PRESUMING THAT THE CAUSE OF HIS FEARS CAME TO HIM ACROSS THE
MOOR IF THAT WERE SO AND IT SEEMS MOST PROBABLE ONLY A MAN WHO HAD
LOST HIS WITS WOULD HAVE RUN FROM THE HOUSE INSTEAD OF TOWARDS IT IF
THE GIPSYS EVIDENCE MAY BE TAKEN AS TRUE HE RAN WITH CRIES FOR HELP
IN THE DIRECTION WHERE HELP WAS LEAST LIKELY TO BE THEN AGAIN WHOM
WAS HE WAITING FOR THAT NIGHT AND WHY WAS HE WAITING FOR HIM IN THE
YEW ALLEY RATHER THAN IN HIS OWN HOUSE
YOU THINK THAT HE WAS WAITING FOR SOMEONE
THE MAN WAS ELDERLY AND INFIRM WE CAN UNDERSTAND HIS TAKING AN
EVENING STROLL BUT THE GROUND WAS DAMP AND THE NIGHT INCLEMENT IS
IT NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD STAND FOR FIVE OR TEN MINUTES AS DR
MORTIMER WITH MORE PRACTICAL SENSE THAN I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM
CREDIT FOR DEDUCED FROM THE CIGAR ASH
BUT HE WENT OUT EVERY EVENING
I THINK IT UNLIKELY THAT HE WAITED AT THE MOORGATE EVERY EVENING
ON THE CONTRARY THE EVIDENCE IS THAT HE AVOIDED THE MOOR THAT NIGHT
HE WAITED THERE IT WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE HE MADE HIS DEPARTURE FOR
LONDON THE THING TAKES SHAPE WATSON IT BECOMES COHERENT MIGHT I
ASK YOU TO HAND ME MY VIOLIN AND WE WILL POSTPONE ALL FURTHER
THOUGHT UPON THIS BUSINESS UNTIL WE HAVE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF MEETING
DR MORTIMER AND SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE IN THE MORNING
CHAPTER IV
SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE
OUR BREAKFASTTABLE WAS CLEARED EARLY AND HOLMES WAITED IN HIS
DRESSINGGOWN FOR THE PROMISED INTERVIEW OUR CLIENTS WERE PUNCTUAL
TO THEIR APPOINTMENT FOR THE CLOCK HAD JUST STRUCK TEN WHEN DR
MORTIMER WAS SHOWN UP FOLLOWED BY THE YOUNG BARONET THE LATTER WAS
A SMALL ALERT DARKEYED MAN ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE VERY
STURDILY BUILT WITH THICK BLACK EYEBROWS AND A STRONG PUGNACIOUS
FACE HE WORE A RUDDYTINTED TWEED SUIT AND HAD THE WEATHERBEATEN
APPEARANCE OF ONE WHO HAS SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME IN THE OPEN AIR AND
YET THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS STEADY EYE AND THE QUIET ASSURANCE OF
HIS BEARING WHICH INDICATED THE GENTLEMAN
THIS IS SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE SAID DR MORTIMER
WHY YES SAID HE AND THE STRANGE THING IS MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
THAT IF MY FRIEND HERE HAD NOT PROPOSED COMING ROUND TO YOU THIS
MORNING I SHOULD HAVE COME ON MY OWN ACCOUNT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
THINK OUT LITTLE PUZZLES AND IVE HAD ONE THIS MORNING WHICH WANTS
MORE THINKING OUT THAN I AM ABLE TO GIVE IT
PRAY TAKE A SEAT SIR HENRY DO I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT YOU
HAVE YOURSELF HAD SOME REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE SINCE YOU ARRIVED IN
LONDON
NOTHING OF MUCH IMPORTANCE MR HOLMES ONLY A JOKE AS LIKE AS NOT
IT WAS THIS LETTER IF YOU CAN CALL IT A LETTER WHICH REACHED ME
THIS MORNING
HE LAID AN ENVELOPE UPON THE TABLE AND WE ALL BENT OVER IT IT WAS
OF COMMON QUALITY GRAYISH IN COLOUR THE ADDRESS SIR HENRY
BASKERVILLE NORTHUMBERLAND HOTEL WAS PRINTED IN ROUGH CHARACTERS
THE POSTMARK CHARING CROSS AND THE DATE OF POSTING THE PRECEDING
EVENING
WHO KNEW THAT YOU WERE GOING TO THE NORTHUMBERLAND HOTEL ASKED
HOLMES GLANCING KEENLY ACROSS AT OUR VISITOR
NO ONE COULD HAVE KNOWN WE ONLY DECIDED AFTER I MET DR MORTIMER
BUT DR MORTIMER WAS NO DOUBT ALREADY STOPPING THERE
NO I HAD BEEN STAYING WITH A FRIEND SAID THE DOCTOR THERE WAS
NO POSSIBLE INDICATION THAT WE INTENDED TO GO TO THIS HOTEL
HUM SOMEONE SEEMS TO BE VERY DEEPLY INTERESTED IN YOUR MOVEMENTS
OUT OF THE ENVELOPE HE TOOK A HALFSHEET OF FOOLSCAP PAPER FOLDED
INTO FOUR THIS HE OPENED AND SPREAD FLAT UPON THE TABLE ACROSS THE
MIDDLE OF IT A SINGLE SENTENCE HAD BEEN FORMED BY THE EXPEDIENT OF
PASTING PRINTED WORDS UPON IT IT RAN
AS YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE OR YOUR REASON KEEP AWAY FROM THE MOOR
THE WORD MOOR ONLY WAS PRINTED IN INK
NOW SAID SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE PERHAPS YOU WILL TELL ME MR
HOLMES WHAT IN THUNDER IS THE MEANING OF THAT AND WHO IT IS THAT
TAKES SO MUCH INTEREST IN MY AFFAIRS
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT DR MORTIMER YOU MUST ALLOW THAT THERE IS
NOTHING SUPERNATURAL ABOUT THIS AT ANY RATE
NO SIR BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL COME FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS CONVINCED
THAT THE BUSINESS IS SUPERNATURAL
WHAT BUSINESS ASKED SIR HENRY SHARPLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALL
YOU GENTLEMEN KNOW A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN I DO ABOUT MY OWN AFFAIRS
YOU SHALL SHARE OUR KNOWLEDGE BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS ROOM SIR HENRY
I PROMISE YOU THAT SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES WE WILL CONFINE OURSELVES
FOR THE PRESENT WITH YOUR PERMISSION TO THIS VERY INTERESTING
DOCUMENT WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER AND POSTED YESTERDAY
EVENING HAVE YOU YESTERDAYS TIMES WATSON
IT IS HERE IN THE CORNER
MIGHT I TROUBLE YOU FOR ITTHE INSIDE PAGE PLEASE WITH THE
LEADING ARTICLES HE GLANCED SWIFTLY OVER IT RUNNING HIS EYES UP
AND DOWN THE COLUMNS CAPITAL ARTICLE THIS ON FREE TRADE PERMIT ME
TO GIVE YOU AN EXTRACT FROM IT
YOU MAY BE CAJOLED INTO IMAGINING THAT YOUR OWN SPECIAL TRADE OR
YOUR OWN INDUSTRY WILL BE ENCOURAGED BY A PROTECTIVE TARIFF BUT IT
STANDS TO REASON THAT SUCH LEGISLATION MUST IN THE LONG RUN KEEP AWAY
WEALTH FROM THE COUNTRY DIMINISH THE VALUE OF OUR IMPORTS AND LOWER
THE GENERAL CONDITIONS OF LIFE IN THIS ISLAND
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT WATSON CRIED HOLMES IN HIGH GLEE
RUBBING HIS HANDS TOGETHER WITH SATISFACTION DONT YOU THINK THAT
IS AN ADMIRABLE SENTIMENT
DR MORTIMER LOOKED AT HOLMES WITH AN AIR OF PROFESSIONAL INTEREST
AND SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE TURNED A PAIR OF PUZZLED DARK EYES UPON ME
I DONT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE TARIFF AND THINGS OF THAT KIND SAID
HE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME WEVE GOT A BIT OFF THE TRAIL SO FAR AS THAT
NOTE IS CONCERNED
ON THE CONTRARY I THINK WE ARE PARTICULARLY HOT UPON THE TRAIL SIR
HENRY WATSON HERE KNOWS MORE ABOUT MY METHODS THAN YOU DO BUT I
FEAR THAT EVEN HE HAS NOT QUITE GRASPED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS
SENTENCE
NO I CONFESS THAT I SEE NO CONNECTION
AND YET MY DEAR WATSON THERE IS SO VERY CLOSE A CONNECTION THAT
THE ONE IS EXTRACTED OUT OF THE OTHER YOU YOUR YOUR LIFE
REASON VALUE KEEP AWAY FROM THE DONT YOU SEE NOW WHENCE
THESE WORDS HAVE BEEN TAKEN
BY THUNDER YOURE RIGHT WELL IF THAT ISNT SMART CRIED SIR
HENRY
IF ANY POSSIBLE DOUBT REMAINED IT IS SETTLED BY THE FACT THAT KEEP
AWAY AND FROM THE ARE CUT OUT IN ONE PIECE
WELL NOWSO IT IS
REALLY MR HOLMES THIS EXCEEDS ANYTHING WHICH I COULD HAVE
IMAGINED SAID DR MORTIMER GAZING AT MY FRIEND IN AMAZEMENT I
COULD UNDERSTAND ANYONE SAYING THAT THE WORDS WERE FROM A NEWSPAPER
BUT THAT YOU SHOULD NAME WHICH AND ADD THAT IT CAME FROM THE LEADING
ARTICLE IS REALLY ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS WHICH I HAVE
EVER KNOWN HOW DID YOU DO IT
I PRESUME DOCTOR THAT YOU COULD TELL THE SKULL OF A NEGRO FROM
THAT OF AN ESQUIMAU
MOST CERTAINLY
BUT HOW
BECAUSE THAT IS MY SPECIAL HOBBY THE DIFFERENCES ARE OBVIOUS THE
SUPRAORBITAL CREST THE FACIAL ANGLE THE MAXILLARY CURVE THE
BUT THIS IS MY SPECIAL HOBBY AND THE DIFFERENCES ARE EQUALLY
OBVIOUS THERE IS AS MUCH DIFFERENCE TO MY EYES BETWEEN THE LEADED
BOURGEOIS TYPE OF A TIMES ARTICLE AND THE SLOVENLY PRINT OF AN
EVENING HALFPENNY PAPER AS THERE COULD BE BETWEEN YOUR NEGRO AND
YOUR ESQUIMAU THE DETECTION OF TYPES IS ONE OF THE MOST ELEMENTARY
BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE TO THE SPECIAL EXPERT IN CRIME THOUGH I
CONFESS THAT ONCE WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG I CONFUSED THE LEEDS MERCURY
WITH THE WESTERN MORNING NEWS BUT A TIMES LEADER IS ENTIRELY
DISTINCTIVE AND THESE WORDS COULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM NOTHING ELSE
AS IT WAS DONE YESTERDAY THE STRONG PROBABILITY WAS THAT WE SHOULD
FIND THE WORDS IN YESTERDAYS ISSUE
SO FAR AS I CAN FOLLOW YOU THEN MR HOLMES SAID SIR HENRY
BASKERVILLE SOMEONE CUT OUT THIS MESSAGE WITH A SCISSORS
NAILSCISSORS SAID HOLMES YOU CAN SEE THAT IT WAS A VERY
SHORTBLADED SCISSORS SINCE THE CUTTER HAD TO TAKE TWO SNIPS OVER
KEEP AWAY
THAT IS SO SOMEONE THEN CUT OUT THE MESSAGE WITH A PAIR OF
SHORTBLADED SCISSORS PASTED IT WITH PASTE
GUM SAID HOLMES
WITH GUM ON TO THE PAPER BUT I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE WORD MOOR
SHOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN
BECAUSE HE COULD NOT FIND IT IN PRINT THE OTHER WORDS WERE ALL
SIMPLE AND MIGHT BE FOUND IN ANY ISSUE BUT MOOR WOULD BE LESS
COMMON
WHY OF COURSE THAT WOULD EXPLAIN IT HAVE YOU READ ANYTHING ELSE
IN THIS MESSAGE MR HOLMES
THERE ARE ONE OR TWO INDICATIONS AND YET THE UTMOST PAINS HAVE BEEN
TAKEN TO REMOVE ALL CLUES THE ADDRESS YOU OBSERVE IS PRINTED IN
ROUGH CHARACTERS BUT THE TIMES IS A PAPER WHICH IS SELDOM FOUND IN
ANY HANDS BUT THOSE OF THE HIGHLY EDUCATED WE MAY TAKE IT
THEREFORE THAT THE LETTER WAS COMPOSED BY AN EDUCATED MAN WHO WISHED
TO POSE AS AN UNEDUCATED ONE AND HIS EFFORT TO CONCEAL HIS OWN
WRITING SUGGESTS THAT THAT WRITING MIGHT BE KNOWN OR COME TO BE
KNOWN BY YOU AGAIN YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT THE WORDS ARE NOT GUMMED
ON IN AN ACCURATE LINE BUT THAT SOME ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN OTHERS
LIFE FOR EXAMPLE IS QUITE OUT OF ITS PROPER PLACE THAT MAY POINT
TO CARELESSNESS OR IT MAY POINT TO AGITATION AND HURRY UPON THE PART
OF THE CUTTER ON THE WHOLE I INCLINE TO THE LATTER VIEW SINCE THE
MATTER WAS EVIDENTLY IMPORTANT AND IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE COMPOSER
OF SUCH A LETTER WOULD BE CARELESS IF HE WERE IN A HURRY IT OPENS UP
THE INTERESTING QUESTION WHY HE SHOULD BE IN A HURRY SINCE ANY
LETTER POSTED UP TO EARLY MORNING WOULD REACH SIR HENRY BEFORE HE
WOULD LEAVE HIS HOTEL DID THE COMPOSER FEAR AN INTERRUPTIONAND
FROM WHOM
WE ARE COMING NOW RATHER INTO THE REGION OF GUESSWORK SAID DR
MORTIMER
SAY RATHER INTO THE REGION WHERE WE BALANCE PROBABILITIES AND
CHOOSE THE MOST LIKELY IT IS THE SCIENTIFIC USE OF THE IMAGINATION
BUT WE HAVE ALWAYS SOME MATERIAL BASIS ON WHICH TO START OUR
SPECULATION NOW YOU WOULD CALL IT A GUESS NO DOUBT BUT I AM
ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THIS ADDRESS HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN A HOTEL
HOW IN THE WORLD CAN YOU SAY THAT
IF YOU EXAMINE IT CAREFULLY YOU WILL SEE THAT BOTH THE PEN AND THE
INK HAVE GIVEN THE WRITER TROUBLE THE PEN HAS SPLUTTERED TWICE IN A
SINGLE WORD AND HAS RUN DRY THREE TIMES IN A SHORT ADDRESS SHOWING
THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE INK IN THE BOTTLE NOW A PRIVATE PEN OR
INKBOTTLE IS SELDOM ALLOWED TO BE IN SUCH A STATE AND THE
COMBINATION OF THE TWO MUST BE QUITE RARE BUT YOU KNOW THE HOTEL INK
AND THE HOTEL PEN WHERE IT IS RARE TO GET ANYTHING ELSE YES I HAVE
VERY LITTLE HESITATION IN SAYING THAT COULD WE EXAMINE THE
WASTEPAPER BASKETS OF THE HOTELS AROUND CHARING CROSS UNTIL WE FOUND
THE REMAINS OF THE MUTILATED TIMES LEADER WE COULD LAY OUR HANDS
STRAIGHT UPON THE PERSON WHO SENT THIS SINGULAR MESSAGE HALLOA
HALLOA WHATS THIS
HE WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINING THE FOOLSCAP UPON WHICH THE WORDS WERE
PASTED HOLDING IT ONLY AN INCH OR TWO FROM HIS EYES
WELL
NOTHING SAID HE THROWING IT DOWN IT IS A BLANK HALFSHEET OF
PAPER WITHOUT EVEN A WATERMARK UPON IT I THINK WE HAVE DRAWN AS
MUCH AS WE CAN FROM THIS CURIOUS LETTER AND NOW SIR HENRY HAS
ANYTHING ELSE OF INTEREST HAPPENED TO YOU SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN IN
LONDON
WHY NO MR HOLMES I THINK NOT
YOU HAVE NOT OBSERVED ANYONE FOLLOW OR WATCH YOU
I SEEM TO HAVE WALKED RIGHT INTO THE THICK OF A DIME NOVEL SAID
OUR VISITOR WHY IN THUNDER SHOULD ANYONE FOLLOW OR WATCH ME
WE ARE COMING TO THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO REPORT TO US BEFORE
WE GO INTO THIS MATTER
WELL IT DEPENDS UPON WHAT YOU THINK WORTH REPORTING
I THINK ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY ROUTINE OF LIFE WELL WORTH
REPORTING
SIR HENRY SMILED
I DONT KNOW MUCH OF BRITISH LIFE YET FOR I HAVE SPENT NEARLY ALL
MY TIME IN THE STATES AND IN CANADA BUT I HOPE THAT TO LOSE ONE OF
YOUR BOOTS IS NOT PART OF THE ORDINARY ROUTINE OF LIFE OVER HERE
YOU HAVE LOST ONE OF YOUR BOOTS
MY DEAR SIR CRIED DR MORTIMER IT IS ONLY MISLAID YOU WILL FIND
IT WHEN YOU RETURN TO THE HOTEL WHAT IS THE USE OF TROUBLING MR
HOLMES WITH TRIFLES OF THIS KIND
WELL HE ASKED ME FOR ANYTHING OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY ROUTINE
EXACTLY SAID HOLMES HOWEVER FOOLISH THE INCIDENT MAY SEEM YOU
HAVE LOST ONE OF YOUR BOOTS YOU SAY
WELL MISLAID IT ANYHOW I PUT THEM BOTH OUTSIDE MY DOOR LAST
NIGHT AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE IN THE MORNING I COULD GET NO SENSE
OUT OF THE CHAP WHO CLEANS THEM THE WORST OF IT IS THAT I ONLY
BOUGHT THE PAIR LAST NIGHT IN THE STRAND AND I HAVE NEVER HAD THEM
ON
IF YOU HAVE NEVER WORN THEM WHY DID YOU PUT THEM OUT TO BE
CLEANED
THEY WERE TAN BOOTS AND HAD NEVER BEEN VARNISHED THAT WAS WHY I PUT
THEM OUT
THEN I UNDERSTAND THAT ON YOUR ARRIVAL IN LONDON YESTERDAY YOU WENT
OUT AT ONCE AND BOUGHT A PAIR OF BOOTS
I DID A GOOD DEAL OF SHOPPING DR MORTIMER HERE WENT ROUND WITH ME
YOU SEE IF I AM TO BE SQUIRE DOWN THERE I MUST DRESS THE PART AND
IT MAY BE THAT I HAVE GOT A LITTLE CARELESS IN MY WAYS OUT WEST
AMONG OTHER THINGS I BOUGHT THESE BROWN BOOTSGAVE SIX DOLLARS FOR
THEMAND HAD ONE STOLEN BEFORE EVER I HAD THEM ON MY FEET
IT SEEMS A SINGULARLY USELESS THING TO STEAL SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
I CONFESS THAT I SHARE DR MORTIMERS BELIEF THAT IT WILL NOT BE
LONG BEFORE THE MISSING BOOT IS FOUND
AND NOW GENTLEMEN SAID THE BARONET WITH DECISION IT SEEMS TO
ME THAT I HAVE SPOKEN QUITE ENOUGH ABOUT THE LITTLE THAT I KNOW IT
IS TIME THAT YOU KEPT YOUR PROMISE AND GAVE ME A FULL ACCOUNT OF WHAT
WE ARE ALL DRIVING AT
YOUR REQUEST IS A VERY REASONABLE ONE HOLMES ANSWERED DR
MORTIMER I THINK YOU COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN TO TELL YOUR STORY AS
YOU TOLD IT TO US
THUS ENCOURAGED OUR SCIENTIFIC FRIEND DREW HIS PAPERS FROM HIS
POCKET AND PRESENTED THE WHOLE CASE AS HE HAD DONE UPON THE MORNING
BEFORE SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE LISTENED WITH THE DEEPEST ATTENTION
AND WITH AN OCCASIONAL EXCLAMATION OF SURPRISE
WELL I SEEM TO HAVE COME INTO AN INHERITANCE WITH A VENGEANCE
SAID HE WHEN THE LONG NARRATIVE WAS FINISHED OF COURSE IVE HEARD
OF THE HOUND EVER SINCE I WAS IN THE NURSERY ITS THE PET STORY OF
THE FAMILY THOUGH I NEVER THOUGHT OF TAKING IT SERIOUSLY BEFORE BUT
AS TO MY UNCLES DEATHWELL IT ALL SEEMS BOILING UP IN MY HEAD AND
I CANT GET IT CLEAR YET YOU DONT SEEM QUITE TO HAVE MADE UP YOUR
MIND WHETHER ITS A CASE FOR A POLICEMAN OR A CLERGYMAN
PRECISELY
AND NOW THERES THIS AFFAIR OF THE LETTER TO ME AT THE HOTEL I
SUPPOSE THAT FITS INTO ITS PLACE
IT SEEMS TO SHOW THAT SOMEONE KNOWS MORE THAN WE DO ABOUT WHAT GOES
ON UPON THE MOOR SAID DR MORTIMER
AND ALSO SAID HOLMES THAT SOMEONE IS NOT ILLDISPOSED TOWARDS
YOU SINCE THEY WARN YOU OF DANGER
OR IT MAY BE THAT THEY WISH FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES TO SCARE ME
AWAY
WELL OF COURSE THAT IS POSSIBLE ALSO I AM VERY MUCH INDEBTED TO
YOU DR MORTIMER FOR INTRODUCING ME TO A PROBLEM WHICH PRESENTS
SEVERAL INTERESTING ALTERNATIVES BUT THE PRACTICAL POINT WHICH WE
NOW HAVE TO DECIDE SIR HENRY IS WHETHER IT IS OR IS NOT ADVISABLE
FOR YOU TO GO TO BASKERVILLE HALL
WHY SHOULD I NOT GO
THERE SEEMS TO BE DANGER
DO YOU MEAN DANGER FROM THIS FAMILY FIEND OR DO YOU MEAN DANGER FROM
HUMAN BEINGS
WELL THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHICHEVER IT IS MY ANSWER IS FIXED THERE IS NO DEVIL IN HELL MR
HOLMES AND THERE IS NO MAN UPON EARTH WHO CAN PREVENT ME FROM GOING
TO THE HOME OF MY OWN PEOPLE AND YOU MAY TAKE THAT TO BE MY FINAL
ANSWER HIS DARK BROWS KNITTED AND HIS FACE FLUSHED TO A DUSKY RED
AS HE SPOKE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE FIERY TEMPER OF THE BASKERVILLES
WAS NOT EXTINCT IN THIS THEIR LAST REPRESENTATIVE MEANWHILE SAID
HE I HAVE HARDLY HAD TIME TO THINK OVER ALL THAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME
ITS A BIG THING FOR A MAN TO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND TO DECIDE AT ONE
SITTING I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A QUIET HOUR BY MYSELF TO MAKE UP MY
MIND NOW LOOK HERE MR HOLMES ITS HALFPAST ELEVEN NOW AND I AM
GOING BACK RIGHT AWAY TO MY HOTEL SUPPOSE YOU AND YOUR FRIEND DR
WATSON COME ROUND AND LUNCH WITH US AT TWO ILL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU
MORE CLEARLY THEN HOW THIS THING STRIKES ME
IS THAT CONVENIENT TO YOU WATSON
PERFECTLY
THEN YOU MAY EXPECT US SHALL I HAVE A CAB CALLED
ID PREFER TO WALK FOR THIS AFFAIR HAS FLURRIED ME RATHER
ILL JOIN YOU IN A WALK WITH PLEASURE SAID HIS COMPANION
THEN WE MEET AGAIN AT TWO OCLOCK AU REVOIR AND GOODMORNING
WE HEARD THE STEPS OF OUR VISITORS DESCEND THE STAIR AND THE BANG OF
THE FRONT DOOR IN AN INSTANT HOLMES HAD CHANGED FROM THE LANGUID
DREAMER TO THE MAN OF ACTION
YOUR HAT AND BOOTS WATSON QUICK NOT A MOMENT TO LOSE HE RUSHED
INTO HIS ROOM IN HIS DRESSINGGOWN AND WAS BACK AGAIN IN A FEW
SECONDS IN A FROCKCOAT WE HURRIED TOGETHER DOWN THE STAIRS AND INTO
THE STREET DR MORTIMER AND BASKERVILLE WERE STILL VISIBLE ABOUT TWO
HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD OF US IN THE DIRECTION OF OXFORD STREET
SHALL I RUN ON AND STOP THEM
NOT FOR THE WORLD MY DEAR WATSON I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH
YOUR COMPANY IF YOU WILL TOLERATE MINE OUR FRIENDS ARE WISE FOR IT
IS CERTAINLY A VERY FINE MORNING FOR A WALK
HE QUICKENED HIS PACE UNTIL WE HAD DECREASED THE DISTANCE WHICH
DIVIDED US BY ABOUT HALF THEN STILL KEEPING A HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND
WE FOLLOWED INTO OXFORD STREET AND SO DOWN REGENT STREET ONCE OUR
FRIENDS STOPPED AND STARED INTO A SHOP WINDOW UPON WHICH HOLMES DID
THE SAME AN INSTANT AFTERWARDS HE GAVE A LITTLE CRY OF SATISFACTION
AND FOLLOWING THE DIRECTION OF HIS EAGER EYES I SAW THAT A HANSOM
CAB WITH A MAN INSIDE WHICH HAD HALTED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
STREET WAS NOW PROCEEDING SLOWLY ONWARD AGAIN
THERES OUR MAN WATSON COME ALONG WELL HAVE A GOOD LOOK AT HIM
IF WE CAN DO NO MORE
AT THAT INSTANT I WAS AWARE OF A BUSHY BLACK BEARD AND A PAIR OF
PIERCING EYES TURNED UPON US THROUGH THE SIDE WINDOW OF THE CAB
INSTANTLY THE TRAPDOOR AT THE TOP FLEW UP SOMETHING WAS SCREAMED TO
THE DRIVER AND THE CAB FLEW MADLY OFF DOWN REGENT STREET HOLMES
LOOKED EAGERLY ROUND FOR ANOTHER BUT NO EMPTY ONE WAS IN SIGHT THEN
HE DASHED IN WILD PURSUIT AMID THE STREAM OF THE TRAFFIC BUT THE
START WAS TOO GREAT AND ALREADY THE CAB WAS OUT OF SIGHT
THERE NOW SAID HOLMES BITTERLY AS HE EMERGED PANTING AND WHITE
WITH VEXATION FROM THE TIDE OF VEHICLES WAS EVER SUCH BAD LUCK AND
SUCH BAD MANAGEMENT TOO WATSON WATSON IF YOU ARE AN HONEST MAN
YOU WILL RECORD THIS ALSO AND SET IT AGAINST MY SUCCESSES
WHO WAS THE MAN
I HAVE NOT AN IDEA
A SPY
WELL IT WAS EVIDENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE HEARD THAT BASKERVILLE HAS
BEEN VERY CLOSELY SHADOWED BY SOMEONE SINCE HE HAS BEEN IN TOWN HOW
ELSE COULD IT BE KNOWN SO QUICKLY THAT IT WAS THE NORTHUMBERLAND
HOTEL WHICH HE HAD CHOSEN IF THEY HAD FOLLOWED HIM THE FIRST DAY I
ARGUED THAT THEY WOULD FOLLOW HIM ALSO THE SECOND YOU MAY HAVE
OBSERVED THAT I TWICE STROLLED OVER TO THE WINDOW WHILE DR MORTIMER
WAS READING HIS LEGEND
YES I REMEMBER
I WAS LOOKING OUT FOR LOITERERS IN THE STREET BUT I SAW NONE WE
ARE DEALING WITH A CLEVER MAN WATSON THIS MATTER CUTS VERY DEEP
AND THOUGH I HAVE NOT FINALLY MADE UP MY MIND WHETHER IT IS A
BENEVOLENT OR A MALEVOLENT AGENCY WHICH IS IN TOUCH WITH US I AM
CONSCIOUS ALWAYS OF POWER AND DESIGN WHEN OUR FRIENDS LEFT I AT ONCE
FOLLOWED THEM IN THE HOPES OF MARKING DOWN THEIR INVISIBLE ATTENDANT
SO WILY WAS HE THAT HE HAD NOT TRUSTED HIMSELF UPON FOOT BUT HE HAD
AVAILED HIMSELF OF A CAB SO THAT HE COULD LOITER BEHIND OR DASH PAST
THEM AND SO ESCAPE THEIR NOTICE HIS METHOD HAD THE ADDITIONAL
ADVANTAGE THAT IF THEY WERE TO TAKE A CAB HE WAS ALL READY TO FOLLOW
THEM IT HAS HOWEVER ONE OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGE
IT PUTS HIM IN THE POWER OF THE CABMAN
EXACTLY
WHAT A PITY WE DID NOT GET THE NUMBER
MY DEAR WATSON CLUMSY AS I HAVE BEEN YOU SURELY DO NOT SERIOUSLY
IMAGINE THAT I NEGLECTED TO GET THE NUMBER NO IS OUR MAN BUT
THAT IS NO USE TO US FOR THE MOMENT
I FAIL TO SEE HOW YOU COULD HAVE DONE MORE
ON OBSERVING THE CAB I SHOULD HAVE INSTANTLY TURNED AND WALKED IN
THE OTHER DIRECTION I SHOULD THEN AT MY LEISURE HAVE HIRED A SECOND
CAB AND FOLLOWED THE FIRST AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE OR BETTER
STILL HAVE DRIVEN TO THE NORTHUMBERLAND HOTEL AND WAITED THERE WHEN
OUR UNKNOWN HAD FOLLOWED BASKERVILLE HOME WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY OF PLAYING HIS OWN GAME UPON HIMSELF AND SEEING WHERE HE
MADE FOR AS IT IS BY AN INDISCREET EAGERNESS WHICH WAS TAKEN
ADVANTAGE OF WITH EXTRAORDINARY QUICKNESS AND ENERGY BY OUR OPPONENT
WE HAVE BETRAYED OURSELVES AND LOST OUR MAN
WE HAD BEEN SAUNTERING SLOWLY DOWN REGENT STREET DURING THIS
CONVERSATION AND DR MORTIMER WITH HIS COMPANION HAD LONG VANISHED
IN FRONT OF US
THERE IS NO OBJECT IN OUR FOLLOWING THEM SAID HOLMES THE SHADOW
HAS DEPARTED AND WILL NOT RETURN WE MUST SEE WHAT FURTHER CARDS WE
HAVE IN OUR HANDS AND PLAY THEM WITH DECISION COULD YOU SWEAR TO
THAT MANS FACE WITHIN THE CAB
I COULD SWEAR ONLY TO THE BEARD
AND SO COULD IFROM WHICH I GATHER THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY IT WAS A
FALSE ONE A CLEVER MAN UPON SO DELICATE AN ERRAND HAS NO USE FOR A
BEARD SAVE TO CONCEAL HIS FEATURES COME IN HERE WATSON
HE TURNED INTO ONE OF THE DISTRICT MESSENGER OFFICES WHERE HE WAS
WARMLY GREETED BY THE MANAGER
AH WILSON I SEE YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE LITTLE CASE IN WHICH I
HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO HELP YOU
NO SIR INDEED I HAVE NOT YOU SAVED MY GOOD NAME AND PERHAPS MY
LIFE
MY DEAR FELLOW YOU EXAGGERATE I HAVE SOME RECOLLECTION WILSON
THAT YOU HAD AMONG YOUR BOYS A LAD NAMED CARTWRIGHT WHO SHOWED SOME
ABILITY DURING THE INVESTIGATION
YES SIR HE IS STILL WITH US
COULD YOU RING HIM UPTHANK YOU AND I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE
CHANGE OF THIS FIVEPOUND NOTE
A LAD OF FOURTEEN WITH A BRIGHT KEEN FACE HAD OBEYED THE SUMMONS
OF THE MANAGER HE STOOD NOW GAZING WITH GREAT REVERENCE AT THE
FAMOUS DETECTIVE
LET ME HAVE THE HOTEL DIRECTORY SAID HOLMES THANK YOU NOW
CARTWRIGHT THERE ARE THE NAMES OF TWENTYTHREE HOTELS HERE ALL IN
THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF CHARING CROSS DO YOU SEE
YES SIR
YOU WILL VISIT EACH OF THESE IN TURN
YES SIR
YOU WILL BEGIN IN EACH CASE BY GIVING THE OUTSIDE PORTER ONE
SHILLING HERE ARE TWENTYTHREE SHILLINGS
YES SIR
YOU WILL TELL HIM THAT YOU WANT TO SEE THE WASTEPAPER OF YESTERDAY
YOU WILL SAY THAT AN IMPORTANT TELEGRAM HAS MISCARRIED AND THAT YOU
ARE LOOKING FOR IT YOU UNDERSTAND
YES SIR
BUT WHAT YOU ARE REALLY LOOKING FOR IS THE CENTRE PAGE OF THE TIMES
WITH SOME HOLES CUT IN IT WITH SCISSORS HERE IS A COPY OF THE TIMES
IT IS THIS PAGE YOU COULD EASILY RECOGNIZE IT COULD YOU NOT
YES SIR
IN EACH CASE THE OUTSIDE PORTER WILL SEND FOR THE HALL PORTER TO
WHOM ALSO YOU WILL GIVE A SHILLING HERE ARE TWENTYTHREE SHILLINGS
YOU WILL THEN LEARN IN POSSIBLY TWENTY CASES OUT OF THE TWENTYTHREE
THAT THE WASTE OF THE DAY BEFORE HAS BEEN BURNED OR REMOVED IN THE
THREE OTHER CASES YOU WILL BE SHOWN A HEAP OF PAPER AND YOU WILL LOOK
FOR THIS PAGE OF THE TIMES AMONG IT THE ODDS ARE ENORMOUSLY AGAINST
YOUR FINDING IT THERE ARE TEN SHILLINGS OVER IN CASE OF EMERGENCIES
LET ME HAVE A REPORT BY WIRE AT BAKER STREET BEFORE EVENING AND NOW
WATSON IT ONLY REMAINS FOR US TO FIND OUT BY WIRE THE IDENTITY OF
THE CABMAN NO AND THEN WE WILL DROP INTO ONE OF THE BOND
STREET PICTURE GALLERIES AND FILL IN THE TIME UNTIL WE ARE DUE AT THE
HOTEL
CHAPTER V
THREE BROKEN THREADS
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD IN A VERY REMARKABLE DEGREE THE POWER OF
DETACHING HIS MIND AT WILL FOR TWO HOURS THE STRANGE BUSINESS IN
WHICH WE HAD BEEN INVOLVED APPEARED TO BE FORGOTTEN AND HE WAS
ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN THE PICTURES OF THE MODERN BELGIAN MASTERS HE
WOULD TALK OF NOTHING BUT ART OF WHICH HE HAD THE CRUDEST IDEAS
FROM OUR LEAVING THE GALLERY UNTIL WE FOUND OURSELVES AT THE
NORTHUMBERLAND HOTEL
SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE IS UPSTAIRS EXPECTING YOU SAID THE CLERK
HE ASKED ME TO SHOW YOU UP AT ONCE WHEN YOU CAME
HAVE YOU ANY OBJECTION TO MY LOOKING AT YOUR REGISTER SAID HOLMES
NOT IN THE LEAST
THE BOOK SHOWED THAT TWO NAMES HAD BEEN ADDED AFTER THAT OF
BASKERVILLE ONE WAS THEOPHILUS JOHNSON AND FAMILY OF NEWCASTLE THE
OTHER MRS OLDMORE AND MAID OF HIGH LODGE ALTON
SURELY THAT MUST BE THE SAME JOHNSON WHOM I USED TO KNOW SAID
HOLMES TO THE PORTER A LAWYER IS HE NOT GRAYHEADED AND WALKS
WITH A LIMP
NO SIR THIS IS MR JOHNSON THE COALOWNER A VERY ACTIVE
GENTLEMAN NOT OLDER THAN YOURSELF
SURELY YOU ARE MISTAKEN ABOUT HIS TRADE
NO SIR HE HAS USED THIS HOTEL FOR MANY YEARS AND HE IS VERY WELL
KNOWN TO US
AH THAT SETTLES IT MRS OLDMORE TOO I SEEM TO REMEMBER THE NAME
EXCUSE MY CURIOSITY BUT OFTEN IN CALLING UPON ONE FRIEND ONE FINDS
ANOTHER
SHE IS AN INVALID LADY SIR HER HUSBAND WAS ONCE MAYOR OF
GLOUCESTER SHE ALWAYS COMES TO US WHEN SHE IS IN TOWN
THANK YOU I AM AFRAID I CANNOT CLAIM HER ACQUAINTANCE WE HAVE
ESTABLISHED A MOST IMPORTANT FACT BY THESE QUESTIONS WATSON HE
CONTINUED IN A LOW VOICE AS WE WENT UPSTAIRS TOGETHER WE KNOW NOW
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO INTERESTED IN OUR FRIEND HAVE NOT SETTLED
DOWN IN HIS OWN HOTEL THAT MEANS THAT WHILE THEY ARE AS WE HAVE
SEEN VERY ANXIOUS TO WATCH HIM THEY ARE EQUALLY ANXIOUS THAT HE
SHOULD NOT SEE THEM NOW THIS IS A MOST SUGGESTIVE FACT
WHAT DOES IT SUGGEST
IT SUGGESTSHALLOA MY DEAR FELLOW WHAT ON EARTH IS THE MATTER
AS WE CAME ROUND THE TOP OF THE STAIRS WE HAD RUN UP AGAINST SIR
HENRY BASKERVILLE HIMSELF HIS FACE WAS FLUSHED WITH ANGER AND HE
HELD AN OLD AND DUSTY BOOT IN ONE OF HIS HANDS SO FURIOUS WAS HE
THAT HE WAS HARDLY ARTICULATE AND WHEN HE DID SPEAK IT WAS IN A MUCH
BROADER AND MORE WESTERN DIALECT THAN ANY WHICH WE HAD HEARD FROM HIM
IN THE MORNING
SEEMS TO ME THEY ARE PLAYING ME FOR A SUCKER IN THIS HOTEL HE
CRIED THEYLL FIND THEYVE STARTED IN TO MONKEY WITH THE WRONG MAN
UNLESS THEY ARE CAREFUL BY THUNDER IF THAT CHAP CANT FIND MY
MISSING BOOT THERE WILL BE TROUBLE I CAN TAKE A JOKE WITH THE BEST
MR HOLMES BUT THEYVE GOT A BIT OVER THE MARK THIS TIME
STILL LOOKING FOR YOUR BOOT
YES SIR AND MEAN TO FIND IT
BUT SURELY YOU SAID THAT IT WAS A NEW BROWN BOOT
SO IT WAS SIR AND NOW ITS AN OLD BLACK ONE
WHAT YOU DONT MEAN TO SAY
THATS JUST WHAT I DO MEAN TO SAY I ONLY HAD THREE PAIRS IN THE
WORLDTHE NEW BROWN THE OLD BLACK AND THE PATENT LEATHERS WHICH I
AM WEARING LAST NIGHT THEY TOOK ONE OF MY BROWN ONES AND TODAY
THEY HAVE SNEAKED ONE OF THE BLACK WELL HAVE YOU GOT IT SPEAK OUT
MAN AND DONT STAND STARING
AN AGITATED GERMAN WAITER HAD APPEARED UPON THE SCENE
NO SIR I HAVE MADE INQUIRY ALL OVER THE HOTEL BUT I CAN HEAR NO
WORD OF IT
WELL EITHER THAT BOOT COMES BACK BEFORE SUNDOWN OR ILL SEE THE
MANAGER AND TELL HIM THAT I GO RIGHT STRAIGHT OUT OF THIS HOTEL
IT SHALL BE FOUND SIRI PROMISE YOU THAT IF YOU WILL HAVE A LITTLE
PATIENCE IT WILL BE FOUND
MIND IT IS FOR ITS THE LAST THING OF MINE THAT ILL LOSE IN THIS
DEN OF THIEVES WELL WELL MR HOLMES YOULL EXCUSE MY TROUBLING
YOU ABOUT SUCH A TRIFLE
I THINK ITS WELL WORTH TROUBLING ABOUT
WHY YOU LOOK VERY SERIOUS OVER IT
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN IT
I JUST DONT ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN IT IT SEEMS THE VERY MADDEST
QUEEREST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME
THE QUEEREST PERHAPS SAID HOLMES THOUGHTFULLY
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT YOURSELF
WELL I DONT PROFESS TO UNDERSTAND IT YET THIS CASE OF YOURS IS
VERY COMPLEX SIR HENRY WHEN TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH YOUR UNCLES
DEATH I AM NOT SURE THAT OF ALL THE FIVE HUNDRED CASES OF CAPITAL
IMPORTANCE WHICH I HAVE HANDLED THERE IS ONE WHICH CUTS SO DEEP BUT
WE HOLD SEVERAL THREADS IN OUR HANDS AND THE ODDS ARE THAT ONE OR
OTHER OF THEM GUIDES US TO THE TRUTH WE MAY WASTE TIME IN FOLLOWING
THE WRONG ONE BUT SOONER OR LATER WE MUST COME UPON THE RIGHT
WE HAD A PLEASANT LUNCHEON IN WHICH LITTLE WAS SAID OF THE BUSINESS
WHICH HAD BROUGHT US TOGETHER IT WAS IN THE PRIVATE SITTINGROOM TO
WHICH WE AFTERWARDS REPAIRED THAT HOLMES ASKED BASKERVILLE WHAT WERE
HIS INTENTIONS
TO GO TO BASKERVILLE HALL
AND WHEN
AT THE END OF THE WEEK
ON THE WHOLE SAID HOLMES I THINK THAT YOUR DECISION IS A WISE
ONE I HAVE AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE BEING DOGGED IN LONDON AND
AMID THE MILLIONS OF THIS GREAT CITY IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER WHO
THESE PEOPLE ARE OR WHAT THEIR OBJECT CAN BE IF THEIR INTENTIONS ARE
EVIL THEY MIGHT DO YOU A MISCHIEF AND WE SHOULD BE POWERLESS TO
PREVENT IT YOU DID NOT KNOW DR MORTIMER THAT YOU WERE FOLLOWED
THIS MORNING FROM MY HOUSE
DR MORTIMER STARTED VIOLENTLY
FOLLOWED BY WHOM
THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS WHAT I CANNOT TELL YOU HAVE YOU AMONG YOUR
NEIGHBOURS OR ACQUAINTANCES ON DARTMOOR ANY MAN WITH A BLACK FULL
BEARD
NOOR LET ME SEEWHY YES BARRYMORE SIR CHARLESS BUTLER IS A
MAN WITH A FULL BLACK BEARD
HA WHERE IS BARRYMORE
HE IS IN CHARGE OF THE HALL
WE HAD BEST ASCERTAIN IF HE IS REALLY THERE OR IF BY ANY
POSSIBILITY HE MIGHT BE IN LONDON
HOW CAN YOU DO THAT
GIVE ME A TELEGRAPH FORM IS ALL READY FOR SIR HENRY THAT WILL
DO ADDRESS TO MR BARRYMORE BASKERVILLE HALL WHAT IS THE NEAREST
TELEGRAPHOFFICE GRIMPEN VERY GOOD WE WILL SEND A SECOND WIRE TO
THE POSTMASTER GRIMPEN TELEGRAM TO MR BARRYMORE TO BE DELIVERED
INTO HIS OWN HAND IF ABSENT PLEASE RETURN WIRE TO SIR HENRY
BASKERVILLE NORTHUMBERLAND HOTEL THAT SHOULD LET US KNOW BEFORE
EVENING WHETHER BARRYMORE IS AT HIS POST IN DEVONSHIRE OR NOT
THATS SO SAID BASKERVILLE BY THE WAY DR MORTIMER WHO IS THIS
BARRYMORE ANYHOW
HE IS THE SON OF THE OLD CARETAKER WHO IS DEAD THEY HAVE LOOKED
AFTER THE HALL FOR FOUR GENERATIONS NOW SO FAR AS I KNOW HE AND HIS
WIFE ARE AS RESPECTABLE A COUPLE AS ANY IN THE COUNTY
AT THE SAME TIME SAID BASKERVILLE ITS CLEAR ENOUGH THAT SO LONG
AS THERE ARE NONE OF THE FAMILY AT THE HALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE A
MIGHTY FINE HOME AND NOTHING TO DO
THAT IS TRUE
DID BARRYMORE PROFIT AT ALL BY SIR CHARLESS WILL ASKED HOLMES
HE AND HIS WIFE HAD FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS EACH
HA DID THEY KNOW THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE THIS
YES SIR CHARLES WAS VERY FOND OF TALKING ABOUT THE PROVISIONS OF
HIS WILL
THAT IS VERY INTERESTING
I HOPE SAID DR MORTIMER THAT YOU DO NOT LOOK WITH SUSPICIOUS
EYES UPON EVERYONE WHO RECEIVED A LEGACY FROM SIR CHARLES FOR I ALSO
HAD A THOUSAND POUNDS LEFT TO ME
INDEED AND ANYONE ELSE
THERE WERE MANY INSIGNIFICANT SUMS TO INDIVIDUALS AND A LARGE
NUMBER OF PUBLIC CHARITIES THE RESIDUE ALL WENT TO SIR HENRY
AND HOW MUCH WAS THE RESIDUE
SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS
HOLMES RAISED HIS EYEBROWS IN SURPRISE I HAD NO IDEA THAT SO
GIGANTIC A SUM WAS INVOLVED SAID HE
SIR CHARLES HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING RICH BUT WE DID NOT KNOW
HOW VERY RICH HE WAS UNTIL WE CAME TO EXAMINE HIS SECURITIES THE
TOTAL VALUE OF THE ESTATE WAS CLOSE ON TO A MILLION
DEAR ME IT IS A STAKE FOR WHICH A MAN MIGHT WELL PLAY A DESPERATE
GAME AND ONE MORE QUESTION DR MORTIMER SUPPOSING THAT ANYTHING
HAPPENED TO OUR YOUNG FRIEND HEREYOU WILL FORGIVE THE UNPLEASANT
HYPOTHESISWHO WOULD INHERIT THE ESTATE
SINCE RODGER BASKERVILLE SIR CHARLESS YOUNGER BROTHER DIED
UNMARRIED THE ESTATE WOULD DESCEND TO THE DESMONDS WHO ARE DISTANT
COUSINS JAMES DESMOND IS AN ELDERLY CLERGYMAN IN WESTMORELAND
THANK YOU THESE DETAILS ARE ALL OF GREAT INTEREST HAVE YOU MET MR
JAMES DESMOND
YES HE ONCE CAME DOWN TO VISIT SIR CHARLES HE IS A MAN OF
VENERABLE APPEARANCE AND OF SAINTLY LIFE I REMEMBER THAT HE REFUSED
TO ACCEPT ANY SETTLEMENT FROM SIR CHARLES THOUGH HE PRESSED IT UPON
HIM
AND THIS MAN OF SIMPLE TASTES WOULD BE THE HEIR TO SIR CHARLESS
THOUSANDS
HE WOULD BE THE HEIR TO THE ESTATE BECAUSE THAT IS ENTAILED HE
WOULD ALSO BE THE HEIR TO THE MONEY UNLESS IT WERE WILLED OTHERWISE
BY THE PRESENT OWNER WHO CAN OF COURSE DO WHAT HE LIKES WITH IT
AND HAVE YOU MADE YOUR WILL SIR HENRY
NO MR HOLMES I HAVE NOT IVE HAD NO TIME FOR IT WAS ONLY
YESTERDAY THAT I LEARNED HOW MATTERS STOOD BUT IN ANY CASE I FEEL
THAT THE MONEY SHOULD GO WITH THE TITLE AND ESTATE THAT WAS MY POOR
UNCLES IDEA HOW IS THE OWNER GOING TO RESTORE THE GLORIES OF THE
BASKERVILLES IF HE HAS NOT MONEY ENOUGH TO KEEP UP THE PROPERTY
HOUSE LAND AND DOLLARS MUST GO TOGETHER
QUITE SO WELL SIR HENRY I AM OF ONE MIND WITH YOU AS TO THE
ADVISABILITY OF YOUR GOING DOWN TO DEVONSHIRE WITHOUT DELAY THERE IS
ONLY ONE PROVISION WHICH I MUST MAKE YOU CERTAINLY MUST NOT GO
ALONE
DR MORTIMER RETURNS WITH ME
BUT DR MORTIMER HAS HIS PRACTICE TO ATTEND TO AND HIS HOUSE IS
MILES AWAY FROM YOURS WITH ALL THE GOOD WILL IN THE WORLD HE MAY BE
UNABLE TO HELP YOU NO SIR HENRY YOU MUST TAKE WITH YOU SOMEONE A
TRUSTY MAN WHO WILL BE ALWAYS BY YOUR SIDE
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD COME YOURSELF MR HOLMES
IF MATTERS CAME TO A CRISIS I SHOULD ENDEAVOUR TO BE PRESENT IN
PERSON BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT WITH MY EXTENSIVE CONSULTING
PRACTICE AND WITH THE CONSTANT APPEALS WHICH REACH ME FROM MANY
QUARTERS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE ABSENT FROM LONDON FOR AN
INDEFINITE TIME AT THE PRESENT INSTANT ONE OF THE MOST REVERED NAMES
IN ENGLAND IS BEING BESMIRCHED BY A BLACKMAILER AND ONLY I CAN STOP
A DISASTROUS SCANDAL YOU WILL SEE HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS FOR ME TO GO
TO DARTMOOR
WHOM WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THEN
HOLMES LAID HIS HAND UPON MY ARM
IF MY FRIEND WOULD UNDERTAKE IT THERE IS NO MAN WHO IS BETTER WORTH
HAVING AT YOUR SIDE WHEN YOU ARE IN A TIGHT PLACE NO ONE CAN SAY SO
MORE CONFIDENTLY THAN I
THE PROPOSITION TOOK ME COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE BUT BEFORE I HAD TIME
TO ANSWER BASKERVILLE SEIZED ME BY THE HAND AND WRUNG IT HEARTILY
WELL NOW THAT IS REAL KIND OF YOU DR WATSON SAID HE YOU SEE
HOW IT IS WITH ME AND YOU KNOW JUST AS MUCH ABOUT THE MATTER AS I
DO IF YOU WILL COME DOWN TO BASKERVILLE HALL AND SEE ME THROUGH ILL
NEVER FORGET IT
THE PROMISE OF ADVENTURE HAD ALWAYS A FASCINATION FOR ME AND I WAS
COMPLIMENTED BY THE WORDS OF HOLMES AND BY THE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH
THE BARONET HAILED ME AS A COMPANION
I WILL COME WITH PLEASURE SAID I I DO NOT KNOW HOW I COULD
EMPLOY MY TIME BETTER
AND YOU WILL REPORT VERY CAREFULLY TO ME SAID HOLMES WHEN A
CRISIS COMES AS IT WILL DO I WILL DIRECT HOW YOU SHALL ACT I
SUPPOSE THAT BY SATURDAY ALL MIGHT BE READY
WOULD THAT SUIT DR WATSON
PERFECTLY
THEN ON SATURDAY UNLESS YOU HEAR TO THE CONTRARY WE SHALL MEET AT
THE TRAIN FROM PADDINGTON
WE HAD RISEN TO DEPART WHEN BASKERVILLE GAVE A CRY OF TRIUMPH AND
DIVING INTO ONE OF THE CORNERS OF THE ROOM HE DREW A BROWN BOOT FROM
UNDER A CABINET
MY MISSING BOOT HE CRIED
MAY ALL OUR DIFFICULTIES VANISH AS EASILY SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
BUT IT IS A VERY SINGULAR THING DR MORTIMER REMARKED I SEARCHED
THIS ROOM CAREFULLY BEFORE LUNCH
AND SO DID I SAID BASKERVILLE EVERY INCH OF IT
THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO BOOT IN IT THEN
IN THAT CASE THE WAITER MUST HAVE PLACED IT THERE WHILE WE WERE
LUNCHING
THE GERMAN WAS SENT FOR BUT PROFESSED TO KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER
NOR COULD ANY INQUIRY CLEAR IT UP ANOTHER ITEM HAD BEEN ADDED TO
THAT CONSTANT AND APPARENTLY PURPOSELESS SERIES OF SMALL MYSTERIES
WHICH HAD SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER SO RAPIDLY SETTING ASIDE THE WHOLE
GRIM STORY OF SIR CHARLESS DEATH WE HAD A LINE OF INEXPLICABLE
INCIDENTS ALL WITHIN THE LIMITS OF TWO DAYS WHICH INCLUDED THE
RECEIPT OF THE PRINTED LETTER THE BLACKBEARDED SPY IN THE HANSOM
THE LOSS OF THE NEW BROWN BOOT THE LOSS OF THE OLD BLACK BOOT AND
NOW THE RETURN OF THE NEW BROWN BOOT HOLMES SAT IN SILENCE IN THE
CAB AS WE DROVE BACK TO BAKER STREET AND I KNEW FROM HIS DRAWN BROWS
AND KEEN FACE THAT HIS MIND LIKE MY OWN WAS BUSY IN ENDEAVOURING TO
FRAME SOME SCHEME INTO WHICH ALL THESE STRANGE AND APPARENTLY
DISCONNECTED EPISODES COULD BE FITTED ALL AFTERNOON AND LATE INTO
THE EVENING HE SAT LOST IN TOBACCO AND THOUGHT
JUST BEFORE DINNER TWO TELEGRAMS WERE HANDED IN THE FIRST RAN
HAVE JUST HEARD THAT BARRYMORE IS AT THE HALL
BASKERVILLE
THE SECOND
VISITED TWENTYTHREE HOTELS AS DIRECTED BUT SORRY TO REPORT UNABLE
TO TRACE CUT SHEET OF TIMES
CARTWRIGHT
THERE GO TWO OF MY THREADS WATSON THERE IS NOTHING MORE
STIMULATING THAN A CASE WHERE EVERYTHING GOES AGAINST YOU WE MUST
CAST ROUND FOR ANOTHER SCENT
WE HAVE STILL THE CABMAN WHO DROVE THE SPY
EXACTLY I HAVE WIRED TO GET HIS NAME AND ADDRESS FROM THE OFFICIAL
REGISTRY I SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THIS WERE AN ANSWER TO MY
QUESTION
THE RING AT THE BELL PROVED TO BE SOMETHING EVEN MORE SATISFACTORY
THAN AN ANSWER HOWEVER FOR THE DOOR OPENED AND A ROUGHLOOKING
FELLOW ENTERED WHO WAS EVIDENTLY THE MAN HIMSELF
I GOT A MESSAGE FROM THE HEAD OFFICE THAT A GENT AT THIS ADDRESS HAD
BEEN INQUIRING FOR SAID HE IVE DRIVEN MY CAB THIS SEVEN
YEARS AND NEVER A WORD OF COMPLAINT I CAME HERE STRAIGHT FROM THE
YARD TO ASK YOU TO YOUR FACE WHAT YOU HAD AGAINST ME
I HAVE NOTHING IN THE WORLD AGAINST YOU MY GOOD MAN SAID HOLMES
ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE HALF A SOVEREIGN FOR YOU IF YOU WILL GIVE ME
A CLEAR ANSWER TO MY QUESTIONS
WELL IVE HAD A GOOD DAY AND NO MISTAKE SAID THE CABMAN WITH A
GRIN WHAT WAS IT YOU WANTED TO ASK SIR

GENTLEMEN DOWN REGENT STREET

GOOD MY TELLING YOU THINGS FOR YOU SEEM TO KNOW AS MUCH AS I DO
ALREADY SAID HE THE TRUTH IS THAT THE GENTLEMAN TOLD ME THAT HE
WAS A DETECTIVE AND THAT I WAS TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT HIM TO ANYONE
MY GOOD FELLOW THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS AND YOU MAY FIND
YOURSELF IN A PRETTY BAD POSITION IF YOU TRY TO HIDE ANYTHING FROM
ME YOU SAY THAT YOUR FARE TOLD YOU THAT HE WAS A DETECTIVE

HE MENTIONED HIS NAME
HOLMES CAST A SWIFT GLANCE OF TRIUMPH AT ME OH HE MENTIONED HIS
NAME DID HE THAT WAS IMPRUDENT WHAT WAS THE NAME THAT HE
MENTIONED
HIS NAME SAID THE CABMAN WAS MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
NEVER HAVE I SEEN MY FRIEND MORE COMPLETELY TAKEN ABACK THAN BY THE
CABMANS REPLY FOR AN INSTANT HE SAT IN SILENT AMAZEMENT THEN HE
BURST INTO A HEARTY LAUGH
A TOUCH WATSONAN UNDENIABLE TOUCH SAID HE I FEEL A FOIL AS
QUICK AND SUPPLE AS MY OWN HE GOT HOME UPON ME VERY PRETTILY THAT
TIME SO HIS NAME WAS SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS IT
YES SIR THAT WAS THE GENTLEMANS NAME
EXCELLENT TELL ME WHERE YOU PICKED HIM UP AND ALL THAT OCCURRED
HE HAILED ME AT HALFPAST NINE IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE HE SAID THAT HE
WAS A DETECTIVE AND HE OFFERED ME TWO GUINEAS IF I WOULD DO EXACTLY
WHAT HE WANTED ALL DAY AND ASK NO QUESTIONS I WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO
AGREE FIRST WE DROVE DOWN TO THE NORTHUMBERLAND HOTEL AND WAITED
THERE UNTIL TWO GENTLEMEN CAME OUT AND TOOK A CAB FROM THE RANK WE
FOLLOWED THEIR CAB UNTIL IT PULLED UP SOMEWHERE NEAR HERE
THIS VERY DOOR SAID HOLMES
WELL I COULDNT BE SURE OF THAT BUT I DARE SAY MY FARE KNEW ALL
ABOUT IT WE PULLED UP HALFWAY DOWN THE STREET AND WAITED AN HOUR
AND A HALF THEN THE TWO GENTLEMEN PASSED US WALKING AND WE
FOLLOWED DOWN BAKER STREET AND ALONG
I KNOW SAID HOLMES
UNTIL WE GOT THREEQUARTERS DOWN REGENT STREET THEN MY GENTLEMAN
THREW UP THE TRAP AND HE CRIED THAT I SHOULD DRIVE RIGHT AWAY TO
WATERLOO STATION AS HARD AS I COULD GO I WHIPPED UP THE MARE AND WE
WERE THERE UNDER THE TEN MINUTES THEN HE PAID UP HIS TWO GUINEAS
LIKE A GOOD ONE AND AWAY HE WENT INTO THE STATION ONLY JUST AS HE
WAS LEAVING HE TURNED ROUND AND HE SAID IT MIGHT INTEREST YOU TO
KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DRIVING MR SHERLOCK HOLMES THATS HOW I
COME TO KNOW THE NAME
I SEE AND YOU SAW NO MORE OF HIM
NOT AFTER HE WENT INTO THE STATION
AND HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
THE CABMAN SCRATCHED HIS HEAD WELL HE WASNT ALTOGETHER SUCH AN
EASY GENTLEMAN TO DESCRIBE ID PUT HIM AT FORTY YEARS OF AGE AND HE
WAS OF A MIDDLE HEIGHT TWO OR THREE INCHES SHORTER THAN YOU SIR HE
WAS DRESSED LIKE A TOFF AND HE HAD A BLACK BEARD CUT SQUARE AT THE
END AND A PALE FACE I DONT KNOW AS I COULD SAY MORE THAN THAT
COLOUR OF HIS EYES
NO I CANT SAY THAT
NOTHING MORE THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER
NO SIR NOTHING
WELL THEN HERE IS YOUR HALFSOVEREIGN THERES ANOTHER ONE WAITING
FOR YOU IF YOU CAN BRING ANY MORE INFORMATION GOOD NIGHT
GOOD NIGHT SIR AND THANK YOU

CHAPTER VI
BASKERVILLE HALL
SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE AND DR MORTIMER WERE READY UPON THE APPOINTED
DAY AND WE STARTED AS ARRANGED FOR DEVONSHIRE MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
DROVE WITH ME TO THE STATION AND GAVE ME HIS LAST PARTING INJUNCTIONS
AND ADVICE
I WILL NOT BIAS YOUR MIND BY SUGGESTING THEORIES OR SUSPICIONS
WATSON SAID HE I WISH YOU SIMPLY TO REPORT FACTS IN THE FULLEST
POSSIBLE MANNER TO ME AND YOU CAN LEAVE ME TO DO THE THEORIZING
WHAT SORT OF FACTS I ASKED
ANYTHING WHICH MAY SEEM TO HAVE A BEARING HOWEVER INDIRECT UPON THE
CASE AND ESPECIALLY THE RELATIONS BETWEEN YOUNG BASKERVILLE AND HIS
NEIGHBOURS OR ANY FRESH PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE DEATH OF SIR
CHARLES I HAVE MADE SOME INQUIRIES MYSELF IN THE LAST FEW DAYS BUT
THE RESULTS HAVE I FEAR BEEN NEGATIVE ONE THING ONLY APPEARS TO BE
CERTAIN AND THAT IS THAT MR JAMES DESMOND WHO IS THE NEXT HEIR IS
AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN OF A VERY AMIABLE DISPOSITION SO THAT THIS
PERSECUTION DOES NOT ARISE FROM HIM I REALLY THINK THAT WE MAY
ELIMINATE HIM ENTIRELY FROM OUR CALCULATIONS THERE REMAIN THE PEOPLE
WHO WILL ACTUALLY SURROUND SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE UPON THE MOOR
WOULD IT NOT BE WELL IN THE FIRST PLACE TO GET RID OF THIS BARRYMORE
COUPLE
BY NO MEANS YOU COULD NOT MAKE A GREATER MISTAKE IF THEY ARE
INNOCENT IT WOULD BE A CRUEL INJUSTICE AND IF THEY ARE GUILTY WE
SHOULD BE GIVING UP ALL CHANCE OF BRINGING IT HOME TO THEM NO NO
WE WILL PRESERVE THEM UPON OUR LIST OF SUSPECTS THEN THERE IS A
GROOM AT THE HALL IF I REMEMBER RIGHT THERE ARE TWO MOORLAND
FARMERS THERE IS OUR FRIEND DR MORTIMER WHOM I BELIEVE TO BE
ENTIRELY HONEST AND THERE IS HIS WIFE OF WHOM WE KNOW NOTHING
THERE IS THIS NATURALIST STAPLETON AND THERE IS HIS SISTER WHO IS
SAID TO BE A YOUNG LADY OF ATTRACTIONS THERE IS MR FRANKLAND OF
LAFTER HALL WHO IS ALSO AN UNKNOWN FACTOR AND THERE ARE ONE OR TWO
OTHER NEIGHBOURS THESE ARE THE FOLK WHO MUST BE YOUR VERY SPECIAL
STUDY
I WILL DO MY BEST
YOU HAVE ARMS I SUPPOSE
YES I THOUGHT IT AS WELL TO TAKE THEM
MOST CERTAINLY KEEP YOUR REVOLVER NEAR YOU NIGHT AND DAY AND NEVER
RELAX YOUR PRECAUTIONS
OUR FRIENDS HAD ALREADY SECURED A FIRSTCLASS CARRIAGE AND WERE
WAITING FOR US UPON THE PLATFORM
NO WE HAVE NO NEWS OF ANY KIND SAID DR MORTIMER IN ANSWER TO MY
FRIENDS QUESTIONS I CAN SWEAR TO ONE THING AND THAT IS THAT WE
HAVE NOT BEEN SHADOWED DURING THE LAST TWO DAYS WE HAVE NEVER GONE
OUT WITHOUT KEEPING A SHARP WATCH AND NO ONE COULD HAVE ESCAPED OUR
NOTICE
YOU HAVE ALWAYS KEPT TOGETHER I PRESUME
EXCEPT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON I USUALLY GIVE UP ONE DAY TO PURE
AMUSEMENT WHEN I COME TO TOWN SO I SPENT IT AT THE MUSEUM OF THE
COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
AND I WENT TO LOOK AT THE FOLK IN THE PARK SAID BASKERVILLE BUT
WE HAD NO TROUBLE OF ANY KIND
IT WAS IMPRUDENT ALL THE SAME SAID HOLMES SHAKING HIS HEAD AND
LOOKING VERY GRAVE I BEG SIR HENRY THAT YOU WILL NOT GO ABOUT
ALONE SOME GREAT MISFORTUNE WILL BEFALL YOU IF YOU DO DID YOU GET
YOUR OTHER BOOT
NO SIR IT IS GONE FOREVER
INDEED THAT IS VERY INTERESTING WELL GOODBYE HE ADDED AS THE
TRAIN BEGAN TO GLIDE DOWN THE PLATFORM BEAR IN MIND SIR HENRY ONE
OF THE PHRASES IN THAT QUEER OLD LEGEND WHICH DR MORTIMER HAS READ
TO US AND AVOID THE MOOR IN THOSE HOURS OF DARKNESS WHEN THE POWERS
OF EVIL ARE EXALTED
I LOOKED BACK AT THE PLATFORM WHEN WE HAD LEFT IT FAR BEHIND AND SAW
THE TALL AUSTERE FIGURE OF HOLMES STANDING MOTIONLESS AND GAZING
AFTER US
THE JOURNEY WAS A SWIFT AND PLEASANT ONE AND I SPENT IT IN MAKING
THE MORE INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE OF MY TWO COMPANIONS AND IN PLAYING
WITH DR MORTIMERS SPANIEL IN A VERY FEW HOURS THE BROWN EARTH HAD
BECOME RUDDY THE BRICK HAD CHANGED TO GRANITE AND RED COWS GRAZED
IN WELLHEDGED FIELDS WHERE THE LUSH GRASSES AND MORE LUXURIANT
VEGETATION SPOKE OF A RICHER IF A DAMPER CLIMATE YOUNG BASKERVILLE
STARED EAGERLY OUT OF THE WINDOW AND CRIED ALOUD WITH DELIGHT AS HE
RECOGNIZED THE FAMILIAR FEATURES OF THE DEVON SCENERY
IVE BEEN OVER A GOOD PART OF THE WORLD SINCE I LEFT IT DR
WATSON SAID HE BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN A PLACE TO COMPARE WITH IT
I NEVER SAW A DEVONSHIRE MAN WHO DID NOT SWEAR BY HIS COUNTY I
REMARKED
IT DEPENDS UPON THE BREED OF MEN QUITE AS MUCH AS ON THE COUNTY
SAID DR MORTIMER A GLANCE AT OUR FRIEND HERE REVEALS THE ROUNDED
HEAD OF THE CELT WHICH CARRIES INSIDE IT THE CELTIC ENTHUSIASM AND
POWER OF ATTACHMENT POOR SIR CHARLESS HEAD WAS OF A VERY RARE TYPE
HALF GAELIC HALF IVERNIAN IN ITS CHARACTERISTICS BUT YOU WERE VERY
YOUNG WHEN YOU LAST SAW BASKERVILLE HALL WERE YOU NOT
I WAS A BOY IN MY TEENS AT THE TIME OF MY FATHERS DEATH AND HAD
NEVER SEEN THE HALL FOR HE LIVED IN A LITTLE COTTAGE ON THE SOUTH
COAST THENCE I WENT STRAIGHT TO A FRIEND IN AMERICA I TELL YOU IT
IS ALL AS NEW TO ME AS IT IS TO DR WATSON AND IM AS KEEN AS
POSSIBLE TO SEE THE MOOR
ARE YOU THEN YOUR WISH IS EASILY GRANTED FOR THERE IS YOUR FIRST
SIGHT OF THE MOOR SAID DR MORTIMER POINTING OUT OF THE CARRIAGE
WINDOW
OVER THE GREEN SQUARES OF THE FIELDS AND THE LOW CURVE OF A WOOD
THERE ROSE IN THE DISTANCE A GRAY MELANCHOLY HILL WITH A STRANGE
JAGGED SUMMIT DIM AND VAGUE IN THE DISTANCE LIKE SOME FANTASTIC
LANDSCAPE IN A DREAM BASKERVILLE SAT FOR A LONG TIME HIS EYES FIXED
UPON IT AND I READ UPON HIS EAGER FACE HOW MUCH IT MEANT TO HIM
THIS FIRST SIGHT OF THAT STRANGE SPOT WHERE THE MEN OF HIS BLOOD HAD
HELD SWAY SO LONG AND LEFT THEIR MARK SO DEEP THERE HE SAT WITH HIS
TWEED SUIT AND HIS AMERICAN ACCENT IN THE CORNER OF A PROSAIC
RAILWAYCARRIAGE AND YET AS I LOOKED AT HIS DARK AND EXPRESSIVE FACE
I FELT MORE THAN EVER HOW TRUE A DESCENDANT HE WAS OF THAT LONG LINE
OF HIGHBLOODED FIERY AND MASTERFUL MEN THERE WERE PRIDE VALOUR
AND STRENGTH IN HIS THICK BROWS HIS SENSITIVE NOSTRILS AND HIS
LARGE HAZEL EYES IF ON THAT FORBIDDING MOOR A DIFFICULT AND
DANGEROUS QUEST SHOULD LIE BEFORE US THIS WAS AT LEAST A COMRADE FOR
WHOM ONE MIGHT VENTURE TO TAKE A RISK WITH THE CERTAINTY THAT HE
WOULD BRAVELY SHARE IT
THE TRAIN PULLED UP AT A SMALL WAYSIDE STATION AND WE ALL DESCENDED
OUTSIDE BEYOND THE LOW WHITE FENCE A WAGONETTE WITH A PAIR OF COBS
WAS WAITING OUR COMING WAS EVIDENTLY A GREAT EVENT FOR
STATIONMASTER AND PORTERS CLUSTERED ROUND US TO CARRY OUT OUR
LUGGAGE IT WAS A SWEET SIMPLE COUNTRY SPOT BUT I WAS SURPRISED TO
OBSERVE THAT BY THE GATE THERE STOOD TWO SOLDIERLY MEN IN DARK
UNIFORMS WHO LEANED UPON THEIR SHORT RIFLES AND GLANCED KEENLY AT US
AS WE PASSED THE COACHMAN A HARDFACED GNARLED LITTLE FELLOW
SALUTED SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE AND IN A FEW MINUTES WE WERE FLYING
SWIFTLY DOWN THE BROAD WHITE ROAD ROLLING PASTURE LANDS CURVED
UPWARD ON EITHER SIDE OF US AND OLD GABLED HOUSES PEEPED OUT FROM
AMID THE THICK GREEN FOLIAGE BUT BEHIND THE PEACEFUL AND SUNLIT
COUNTRYSIDE THERE ROSE EVER DARK AGAINST THE EVENING SKY THE LONG
GLOOMY CURVE OF THE MOOR BROKEN BY THE JAGGED AND SINISTER HILLS
THE WAGONETTE SWUNG ROUND INTO A SIDE ROAD AND WE CURVED UPWARD
THROUGH DEEP LANES WORN BY CENTURIES OF WHEELS HIGH BANKS ON EITHER
SIDE HEAVY WITH DRIPPING MOSS AND FLESHY HARTSTONGUE FERNS
BRONZING BRACKEN AND MOTTLED BRAMBLE GLEAMED IN THE LIGHT OF THE
SINKING SUN STILL STEADILY RISING WE PASSED OVER A NARROW GRANITE
BRIDGE AND SKIRTED A NOISY STREAM WHICH GUSHED SWIFTLY DOWN FOAMING
AND ROARING AMID THE GRAY BOULDERS BOTH ROAD AND STREAM WOUND UP
THROUGH A VALLEY DENSE WITH SCRUB OAK AND FIR AT EVERY TURN
BASKERVILLE GAVE AN EXCLAMATION OF DELIGHT LOOKING EAGERLY ABOUT HIM
AND ASKING COUNTLESS QUESTIONS TO HIS EYES ALL SEEMED BEAUTIFUL BUT
TO ME A TINGE OF MELANCHOLY LAY UPON THE COUNTRYSIDE WHICH BORE SO
CLEARLY THE MARK OF THE WANING YEAR YELLOW LEAVES CARPETED THE LANES
AND FLUTTERED DOWN UPON US AS WE PASSED THE RATTLE OF OUR WHEELS
DIED AWAY AS WE DROVE THROUGH DRIFTS OF ROTTING VEGETATIONSAD
GIFTS AS IT SEEMED TO ME FOR NATURE TO THROW BEFORE THE CARRIAGE OF
THE RETURNING HEIR OF THE BASKERVILLES
HALLOA CRIED DR MORTIMER WHAT IS THIS
A STEEP CURVE OF HEATHCLAD LAND AN OUTLYING SPUR OF THE MOOR LAY
IN FRONT OF US ON THE SUMMIT HARD AND CLEAR LIKE AN EQUESTRIAN
STATUE UPON ITS PEDESTAL WAS A MOUNTED SOLDIER DARK AND STERN HIS
RIFLE POISED READY OVER HIS FOREARM HE WAS WATCHING THE ROAD ALONG
WHICH WE TRAVELLED
WHAT IS THIS PERKINS ASKED DR MORTIMER
OUR DRIVER HALF TURNED IN HIS SEAT
THERES A CONVICT ESCAPED FROM PRINCETOWN SIR HES BEEN OUT THREE
DAYS NOW AND THE WARDERS WATCH EVERY ROAD AND EVERY STATION BUT
THEYVE HAD NO SIGHT OF HIM YET THE FARMERS ABOUT HERE DONT LIKE
IT SIR AND THATS A FACT
WELL I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY GET FIVE POUNDS IF THEY CAN GIVE
INFORMATION
YES SIR BUT THE CHANCE OF FIVE POUNDS IS BUT A POOR THING COMPARED
TO THE CHANCE OF HAVING YOUR THROAT CUT YOU SEE IT ISNT LIKE ANY
ORDINARY CONVICT THIS IS A MAN THAT WOULD STICK AT NOTHING
WHO IS HE THEN
IT IS SELDEN THE NOTTING HILL MURDERER
I REMEMBERED THE CASE WELL FOR IT WAS ONE IN WHICH HOLMES HAD TAKEN
AN INTEREST ON ACCOUNT OF THE PECULIAR FEROCITY OF THE CRIME AND THE
WANTON BRUTALITY WHICH HAD MARKED ALL THE ACTIONS OF THE ASSASSIN
THE COMMUTATION OF HIS DEATH SENTENCE HAD BEEN DUE TO SOME DOUBTS AS
TO HIS COMPLETE SANITY SO ATROCIOUS WAS HIS CONDUCT OUR WAGONETTE
HAD TOPPED A RISE AND IN FRONT OF US ROSE THE HUGE EXPANSE OF THE
MOOR MOTTLED WITH GNARLED AND CRAGGY CAIRNS AND TORS A COLD WIND
SWEPT DOWN FROM IT AND SET US SHIVERING SOMEWHERE THERE ON THAT
DESOLATE PLAIN WAS LURKING THIS FIENDISH MAN HIDING IN A BURROW
LIKE A WILD BEAST HIS HEART FULL OF MALIGNANCY AGAINST THE WHOLE
RACE WHICH HAD CAST HIM OUT IT NEEDED BUT THIS TO COMPLETE THE GRIM
SUGGESTIVENESS OF THE BARREN WASTE THE CHILLING WIND AND THE
DARKLING SKY EVEN BASKERVILLE FELL SILENT AND PULLED HIS OVERCOAT
MORE CLOSELY AROUND HIM
WE HAD LEFT THE FERTILE COUNTRY BEHIND AND BENEATH US WE LOOKED BACK
ON IT NOW THE SLANTING RAYS OF A LOW SUN TURNING THE STREAMS TO
THREADS OF GOLD AND GLOWING ON THE RED EARTH NEW TURNED BY THE PLOUGH
AND THE BROAD TANGLE OF THE WOODLANDS THE ROAD IN FRONT OF US GREW
BLEAKER AND WILDER OVER HUGE RUSSET AND OLIVE SLOPES SPRINKLED WITH
GIANT BOULDERS NOW AND THEN WE PASSED A MOORLAND COTTAGE WALLED AND
ROOFED WITH STONE WITH NO CREEPER TO BREAK ITS HARSH OUTLINE
SUDDENLY WE LOOKED DOWN INTO A CUPLIKE DEPRESSION PATCHED WITH
STUNTED OAKS AND FIRS WHICH HAD BEEN TWISTED AND BENT BY THE FURY OF
YEARS OF STORM TWO HIGH NARROW TOWERS ROSE OVER THE TREES THE
DRIVER POINTED WITH HIS WHIP
BASKERVILLE HALL SAID HE
ITS MASTER HAD RISEN AND WAS STARING WITH FLUSHED CHEEKS AND SHINING
EYES A FEW MINUTES LATER WE HAD REACHED THE LODGEGATES A MAZE OF
FANTASTIC TRACERY IN WROUGHT IRON WITH WEATHERBITTEN PILLARS ON
EITHER SIDE BLOTCHED WITH LICHENS AND SURMOUNTED BY THE BOARS
HEADS OF THE BASKERVILLES THE LODGE WAS A RUIN OF BLACK GRANITE AND
BARED RIBS OF RAFTERS BUT FACING IT WAS A NEW BUILDING HALF
CONSTRUCTED THE FIRST FRUIT OF SIR CHARLESS SOUTH AFRICAN GOLD
THROUGH THE GATEWAY WE PASSED INTO THE AVENUE WHERE THE WHEELS WERE
AGAIN HUSHED AMID THE LEAVES AND THE OLD TREES SHOT THEIR BRANCHES
IN A SOMBRE TUNNEL OVER OUR HEADS BASKERVILLE SHUDDERED AS HE LOOKED
UP THE LONG DARK DRIVE TO WHERE THE HOUSE GLIMMERED LIKE A GHOST AT
THE FARTHER END
WAS IT HERE HE ASKED IN A LOW VOICE
NO NO THE YEW ALLEY IS ON THE OTHER SIDE
THE YOUNG HEIR GLANCED ROUND WITH A GLOOMY FACE
ITS NO WONDER MY UNCLE FELT AS IF TROUBLE WERE COMING ON HIM IN
SUCH A PLACE AS THIS SAID HE ITS ENOUGH TO SCARE ANY MAN ILL
HAVE A ROW OF ELECTRIC LAMPS UP HERE INSIDE OF SIX MONTHS AND YOU
WONT KNOW IT AGAIN WITH A THOUSAND CANDLEPOWER SWAN AND EDISON
RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF THE HALL DOOR
THE AVENUE OPENED INTO A BROAD EXPANSE OF TURF AND THE HOUSE LAY
BEFORE US IN THE FADING LIGHT I COULD SEE THAT THE CENTRE WAS A
HEAVY BLOCK OF BUILDING FROM WHICH A PORCH PROJECTED THE WHOLE FRONT
WAS DRAPED IN IVY WITH A PATCH CLIPPED BARE HERE AND THERE WHERE A
WINDOW OR A COATOFARMS BROKE THROUGH THE DARK VEIL FROM THIS
CENTRAL BLOCK ROSE THE TWIN TOWERS ANCIENT CRENELATED AND PIERCED
WITH MANY LOOPHOLES TO RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE TURRETS WERE MORE
MODERN WINGS OF BLACK GRANITE A DULL LIGHT SHONE THROUGH HEAVY
MULLIONED WINDOWS AND FROM THE HIGH CHIMNEYS WHICH ROSE FROM THE
STEEP HIGHANGLED ROOF THERE SPRANG A SINGLE BLACK COLUMN OF SMOKE
WELCOME SIR HENRY WELCOME TO BASKERVILLE HALL
A TALL MAN HAD STEPPED FROM THE SHADOW OF THE PORCH TO OPEN THE DOOR
OF THE WAGONETTE THE FIGURE OF A WOMAN WAS SILHOUETTED AGAINST THE
YELLOW LIGHT OF THE HALL SHE CAME OUT AND HELPED THE MAN TO HAND
DOWN OUR BAGS
YOU DONT MIND MY DRIVING STRAIGHT HOME SIR HENRY SAID DR
MORTIMER MY WIFE IS EXPECTING ME
SURELY YOU WILL STAY AND HAVE SOME DINNER
NO I MUST GO I SHALL PROBABLY FIND SOME WORK AWAITING ME I WOULD
STAY TO SHOW YOU OVER THE HOUSE BUT BARRYMORE WILL BE A BETTER GUIDE
THAN I GOODBYE AND NEVER HESITATE NIGHT OR DAY TO SEND FOR ME IF I
CAN BE OF SERVICE
THE WHEELS DIED AWAY DOWN THE DRIVE WHILE SIR HENRY AND I TURNED INTO
THE HALL AND THE DOOR CLANGED HEAVILY BEHIND US IT WAS A FINE
APARTMENT IN WHICH WE FOUND OURSELVES LARGE LOFTY AND HEAVILY
RAFTERED WITH HUGE BALKS OF AGEBLACKENED OAK IN THE GREAT
OLDFASHIONED FIREPLACE BEHIND THE HIGH IRON DOGS A LOGFIRE CRACKLED
AND SNAPPED SIR HENRY AND I HELD OUT OUR HANDS TO IT FOR WE WERE
NUMB FROM OUR LONG DRIVE THEN WE GAZED ROUND US AT THE HIGH THIN
WINDOW OF OLD STAINED GLASS THE OAK PANELLING THE STAGS HEADS THE
COATSOFARMS UPON THE WALLS ALL DIM AND SOMBRE IN THE SUBDUED LIGHT
OF THE CENTRAL LAMP
ITS JUST AS I IMAGINED IT SAID SIR HENRY IS IT NOT THE VERY
PICTURE OF AN OLD FAMILY HOME TO THINK THAT THIS SHOULD BE THE SAME
HALL IN WHICH FOR FIVE HUNDRED YEARS MY PEOPLE HAVE LIVED IT STRIKES
ME SOLEMN TO THINK OF IT
I SAW HIS DARK FACE LIT UP WITH A BOYISH ENTHUSIASM AS HE GAZED ABOUT
HIM THE LIGHT BEAT UPON HIM WHERE HE STOOD BUT LONG SHADOWS TRAILED
DOWN THE WALLS AND HUNG LIKE A BLACK CANOPY ABOVE HIM BARRYMORE HAD
RETURNED FROM TAKING OUR LUGGAGE TO OUR ROOMS HE STOOD IN FRONT OF
US NOW WITH THE SUBDUED MANNER OF A WELLTRAINED SERVANT HE WAS A
REMARKABLELOOKING MAN TALL HANDSOME WITH A SQUARE BLACK BEARD AND
PALE DISTINGUISHED FEATURES
WOULD YOU WISH DINNER TO BE SERVED AT ONCE SIR
IS IT READY
IN A VERY FEW MINUTES SIR YOU WILL FIND HOT WATER IN YOUR ROOMS
MY WIFE AND I WILL BE HAPPY SIR HENRY TO STAY WITH YOU UNTIL YOU
HAVE MADE YOUR FRESH ARRANGEMENTS BUT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT UNDER
THE NEW CONDITIONS THIS HOUSE WILL REQUIRE A CONSIDERABLE STAFF
WHAT NEW CONDITIONS
I ONLY MEANT SIR THAT SIR CHARLES LED A VERY RETIRED LIFE AND WE
WERE ABLE TO LOOK AFTER HIS WANTS YOU WOULD NATURALLY WISH TO HAVE
MORE COMPANY AND SO YOU WILL NEED CHANGES IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD
DO YOU MEAN THAT YOUR WIFE AND YOU WISH TO LEAVE
ONLY WHEN IT IS QUITE CONVENIENT TO YOU SIR
BUT YOUR FAMILY HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS HAVE THEY
NOT I SHOULD BE SORRY TO BEGIN MY LIFE HERE BY BREAKING AN OLD
FAMILY CONNECTION
I SEEMED TO DISCERN SOME SIGNS OF EMOTION UPON THE BUTLERS WHITE
FACE
I FEEL THAT ALSO SIR AND SO DOES MY WIFE BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH
SIR WE WERE BOTH VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO SIR CHARLES AND HIS DEATH
GAVE US A SHOCK AND MADE THESE SURROUNDINGS VERY PAINFUL TO US I
FEAR THAT WE SHALL NEVER AGAIN BE EASY IN OUR MINDS AT BASKERVILLE
HALL
BUT WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO
I HAVE NO DOUBT SIR THAT WE SHALL SUCCEED IN ESTABLISHING
OURSELVES IN SOME BUSINESS SIR CHARLESS GENEROSITY HAS GIVEN US THE
MEANS TO DO SO AND NOW SIR PERHAPS I HAD BEST SHOW YOU TO YOUR
ROOMS
A SQUARE BALUSTRADED GALLERY RAN ROUND THE TOP OF THE OLD HALL
APPROACHED BY A DOUBLE STAIR FROM THIS CENTRAL POINT TWO LONG
CORRIDORS EXTENDED THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE BUILDING FROM WHICH ALL
THE BEDROOMS OPENED MY OWN WAS IN THE SAME WING AS BASKERVILLES AND
ALMOST NEXT DOOR TO IT THESE ROOMS APPEARED TO BE MUCH MORE MODERN
THAN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE HOUSE AND THE BRIGHT PAPER AND NUMEROUS
CANDLES DID SOMETHING TO REMOVE THE SOMBRE IMPRESSION WHICH OUR
ARRIVAL HAD LEFT UPON MY MIND
BUT THE DININGROOM WHICH OPENED OUT OF THE HALL WAS A PLACE OF
SHADOW AND GLOOM IT WAS A LONG CHAMBER WITH A STEP SEPARATING THE
DAIS WHERE THE FAMILY SAT FROM THE LOWER PORTION RESERVED FOR THEIR
DEPENDENTS AT ONE END A MINSTRELS GALLERY OVERLOOKED IT BLACK
BEAMS SHOT ACROSS ABOVE OUR HEADS WITH A SMOKEDARKENED CEILING
BEYOND THEM WITH ROWS OF FLARING TORCHES TO LIGHT IT UP AND THE
COLOUR AND RUDE HILARITY OF AN OLDTIME BANQUET IT MIGHT HAVE
SOFTENED BUT NOW WHEN TWO BLACKCLOTHED GENTLEMEN SAT IN THE LITTLE
CIRCLE OF LIGHT THROWN BY A SHADED LAMP ONES VOICE BECAME HUSHED
AND ONES SPIRIT SUBDUED A DIM LINE OF ANCESTORS IN EVERY VARIETY
OF DRESS FROM THE ELIZABETHAN KNIGHT TO THE BUCK OF THE REGENCY
STARED DOWN UPON US AND DAUNTED US BY THEIR SILENT COMPANY WE TALKED
LITTLE AND I FOR ONE WAS GLAD WHEN THE MEAL WAS OVER AND WE WERE
ABLE TO RETIRE INTO THE MODERN BILLIARDROOM AND SMOKE A CIGARETTE
MY WORD IT ISNT A VERY CHEERFUL PLACE SAID SIR HENRY I SUPPOSE
ONE CAN TONE DOWN TO IT BUT I FEEL A BIT OUT OF THE PICTURE AT
PRESENT I DONT WONDER THAT MY UNCLE GOT A LITTLE JUMPY IF HE LIVED
ALL ALONE IN SUCH A HOUSE AS THIS HOWEVER IF IT SUITS YOU WE WILL
RETIRE EARLY TONIGHT AND PERHAPS THINGS MAY SEEM MORE CHEERFUL IN
THE MORNING
I DREW ASIDE MY CURTAINS BEFORE I WENT TO BED AND LOOKED OUT FROM MY
WINDOW IT OPENED UPON THE GRASSY SPACE WHICH LAY IN FRONT OF THE
HALL DOOR BEYOND TWO COPSES OF TREES MOANED AND SWUNG IN A RISING
WIND A HALF MOON BROKE THROUGH THE RIFTS OF RACING CLOUDS IN ITS
COLD LIGHT I SAW BEYOND THE TREES A BROKEN FRINGE OF ROCKS AND THE
LONG LOW CURVE OF THE MELANCHOLY MOOR I CLOSED THE CURTAIN FEELING
THAT MY LAST IMPRESSION WAS IN KEEPING WITH THE REST
AND YET IT WAS NOT QUITE THE LAST I FOUND MYSELF WEARY AND YET
WAKEFUL TOSSING RESTLESSLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE SEEKING FOR THE SLEEP
WHICH WOULD NOT COME FAR AWAY A CHIMING CLOCK STRUCK OUT THE
QUARTERS OF THE HOURS BUT OTHERWISE A DEATHLY SILENCE LAY UPON THE
OLD HOUSE AND THEN SUDDENLY IN THE VERY DEAD OF THE NIGHT THERE
CAME A SOUND TO MY EARS CLEAR RESONANT AND UNMISTAKABLE IT WAS
THE SOB OF A WOMAN THE MUFFLED STRANGLING GASP OF ONE WHO IS TORN
BY AN UNCONTROLLABLE SORROW I SAT UP IN BED AND LISTENED INTENTLY
THE NOISE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FAR AWAY AND WAS CERTAINLY IN THE
HOUSE FOR HALF AN HOUR I WAITED WITH EVERY NERVE ON THE ALERT BUT
THERE CAME NO OTHER SOUND SAVE THE CHIMING CLOCK AND THE RUSTLE OF
THE IVY ON THE WALL
CHAPTER VII
THE STAPLETONS OF MERRIPIT HOUSE
THE FRESH BEAUTY OF THE FOLLOWING MORNING DID SOMETHING TO EFFACE
FROM OUR MINDS THE GRIM AND GRAY IMPRESSION WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT UPON
BOTH OF US BY OUR FIRST EXPERIENCE OF BASKERVILLE HALL AS SIR HENRY
AND I SAT AT BREAKFAST THE SUNLIGHT FLOODED IN THROUGH THE HIGH
MULLIONED WINDOWS THROWING WATERY PATCHES OF COLOUR FROM THE COATS
OF ARMS WHICH COVERED THEM THE DARK PANELLING GLOWED LIKE BRONZE IN
THE GOLDEN RAYS AND IT WAS HARD TO REALIZE THAT THIS WAS INDEED THE
CHAMBER WHICH HAD STRUCK SUCH A GLOOM INTO OUR SOULS UPON THE EVENING
BEFORE
I GUESS IT IS OURSELVES AND NOT THE HOUSE THAT WE HAVE TO BLAME
SAID THE BARONET WE WERE TIRED WITH OUR JOURNEY AND CHILLED BY OUR
DRIVE SO WE TOOK A GRAY VIEW OF THE PLACE NOW WE ARE FRESH AND
WELL SO IT IS ALL CHEERFUL ONCE MORE
AND YET IT WAS NOT ENTIRELY A QUESTION OF IMAGINATION I ANSWERED
DID YOU FOR EXAMPLE HAPPEN TO HEAR SOMEONE A WOMAN I THINK
SOBBING IN THE NIGHT
THAT IS CURIOUS FOR I DID WHEN I WAS HALF ASLEEP FANCY THAT I HEARD
SOMETHING OF THE SORT I WAITED QUITE A TIME BUT THERE WAS NO MORE
OF IT SO I CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS ALL A DREAM
I HEARD IT DISTINCTLY AND I AM SURE THAT IT WAS REALLY THE SOB OF A
WOMAN
WE MUST ASK ABOUT THIS RIGHT AWAY HE RANG THE BELL AND ASKED
BARRYMORE WHETHER HE COULD ACCOUNT FOR OUR EXPERIENCE IT SEEMED TO
ME THAT THE PALLID FEATURES OF THE BUTLER TURNED A SHADE PALER STILL
AS HE LISTENED TO HIS MASTERS QUESTION
THERE ARE ONLY TWO WOMEN IN THE HOUSE SIR HENRY HE ANSWERED ONE
IS THE SCULLERYMAID WHO SLEEPS IN THE OTHER WING THE OTHER IS MY
WIFE AND I CAN ANSWER FOR IT THAT THE SOUND COULD NOT HAVE COME FROM
HER
AND YET HE LIED AS HE SAID IT FOR IT CHANCED THAT AFTER BREAKFAST I
MET MRS BARRYMORE IN THE LONG CORRIDOR WITH THE SUN FULL UPON HER
FACE SHE WAS A LARGE IMPASSIVE HEAVYFEATURED WOMAN WITH A STERN
SET EXPRESSION OF MOUTH BUT HER TELLTALE EYES WERE RED AND GLANCED
AT ME FROM BETWEEN SWOLLEN LIDS IT WAS SHE THEN WHO WEPT IN THE
NIGHT AND IF SHE DID SO HER HUSBAND MUST KNOW IT YET HE HAD TAKEN
THE OBVIOUS RISK OF DISCOVERY IN DECLARING THAT IT WAS NOT SO WHY
HAD HE DONE THIS AND WHY DID SHE WEEP SO BITTERLY ALREADY ROUND
THIS PALEFACED HANDSOME BLACKBEARDED MAN THERE WAS GATHERING AN
ATMOSPHERE OF MYSTERY AND OF GLOOM IT WAS HE WHO HAD BEEN THE FIRST
TO DISCOVER THE BODY OF SIR CHARLES AND WE HAD ONLY HIS WORD FOR ALL
THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED UP TO THE OLD MANS DEATH WAS IT
POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS BARRYMORE AFTER ALL WHOM WE HAD SEEN IN THE CAB
IN REGENT STREET THE BEARD MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN THE SAME THE CABMAN
HAD DESCRIBED A SOMEWHAT SHORTER MAN BUT SUCH AN IMPRESSION MIGHT
EASILY HAVE BEEN ERRONEOUS HOW COULD I SETTLE THE POINT FOREVER
OBVIOUSLY THE FIRST THING TO DO WAS TO SEE THE GRIMPEN POSTMASTER
AND FIND WHETHER THE TEST TELEGRAM HAD REALLY BEEN PLACED IN
BARRYMORES OWN HANDS BE THE ANSWER WHAT IT MIGHT I SHOULD AT LEAST
HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT TO SHERLOCK HOLMES
SIR HENRY HAD NUMEROUS PAPERS TO EXAMINE AFTER BREAKFAST SO THAT THE
TIME WAS PROPITIOUS FOR MY EXCURSION IT WAS A PLEASANT WALK OF FOUR
MILES ALONG THE EDGE OF THE MOOR LEADING ME AT LAST TO A SMALL GRAY
HAMLET IN WHICH TWO LARGER BUILDINGS WHICH PROVED TO BE THE INN AND
THE HOUSE OF DR MORTIMER STOOD HIGH ABOVE THE REST THE POSTMASTER
WHO WAS ALSO THE VILLAGE GROCER HAD A CLEAR RECOLLECTION OF THE
TELEGRAM
CERTAINLY SIR SAID HE I HAD THE TELEGRAM DELIVERED TO MR
BARRYMORE EXACTLY AS DIRECTED
WHO DELIVERED IT
MY BOY HERE JAMES YOU DELIVERED THAT TELEGRAM TO MR BARRYMORE AT
THE HALL LAST WEEK DID YOU NOT
YES FATHER I DELIVERED IT
INTO HIS OWN HANDS I ASKED
WELL HE WAS UP IN THE LOFT AT THE TIME SO THAT I COULD NOT PUT IT
INTO HIS OWN HANDS BUT I GAVE IT INTO MRS BARRYMORES HANDS AND
SHE PROMISED TO DELIVER IT AT ONCE
DID YOU SEE MR BARRYMORE
NO SIR I TELL YOU HE WAS IN THE LOFT
IF YOU DIDNT SEE HIM HOW DO YOU KNOW HE WAS IN THE LOFT
WELL SURELY HIS OWN WIFE OUGHT TO KNOW WHERE HE IS SAID THE
POSTMASTER TESTILY DIDNT HE GET THE TELEGRAM IF THERE IS ANY
MISTAKE IT IS FOR MR BARRYMORE HIMSELF TO COMPLAIN
IT SEEMED HOPELESS TO PURSUE THE INQUIRY ANY FARTHER BUT IT WAS
CLEAR THAT IN SPITE OF HOLMESS RUSE WE HAD NO PROOF THAT BARRYMORE
HAD NOT BEEN IN LONDON ALL THE TIME SUPPOSE THAT IT WERE SOSUPPOSE
THAT THE SAME MAN HAD BEEN THE LAST WHO HAD SEEN SIR CHARLES ALIVE
AND THE FIRST TO DOG THE NEW HEIR WHEN HE RETURNED TO ENGLAND WHAT
THEN WAS HE THE AGENT OF OTHERS OR HAD HE SOME SINISTER DESIGN OF
HIS OWN WHAT INTEREST COULD HE HAVE IN PERSECUTING THE BASKERVILLE
FAMILY I THOUGHT OF THE STRANGE WARNING CLIPPED OUT OF THE LEADING
ARTICLE OF THE TIMES WAS THAT HIS WORK OR WAS IT POSSIBLY THE DOING
OF SOMEONE WHO WAS BENT UPON COUNTERACTING HIS SCHEMES THE ONLY
CONCEIVABLE MOTIVE WAS THAT WHICH HAD BEEN SUGGESTED BY SIR HENRY
THAT IF THE FAMILY COULD BE SCARED AWAY A COMFORTABLE AND PERMANENT
HOME WOULD BE SECURED FOR THE BARRYMORES BUT SURELY SUCH AN
EXPLANATION AS THAT WOULD BE QUITE INADEQUATE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DEEP
AND SUBTLE SCHEMING WHICH SEEMED TO BE WEAVING AN INVISIBLE NET ROUND
THE YOUNG BARONET HOLMES HIMSELF HAD SAID THAT NO MORE COMPLEX CASE
HAD COME TO HIM IN ALL THE LONG SERIES OF HIS SENSATIONAL
INVESTIGATIONS I PRAYED AS I WALKED BACK ALONG THE GRAY LONELY
ROAD THAT MY FRIEND MIGHT SOON BE FREED FROM HIS PREOCCUPATIONS AND
ABLE TO COME DOWN TO TAKE THIS HEAVY BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM MY
SHOULDERS
SUDDENLY MY THOUGHTS WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE SOUND OF RUNNING FEET
BEHIND ME AND BY A VOICE WHICH CALLED ME BY NAME I TURNED EXPECTING
TO SEE DR MORTIMER BUT TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS A STRANGER WHO WAS
PURSUING ME HE WAS A SMALL SLIM CLEANSHAVEN PRIMFACED MAN
FLAXENHAIRED AND LEANJAWED BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY YEARS OF AGE
DRESSED IN A GRAY SUIT AND WEARING A STRAW HAT A TIN BOX FOR
BOTANICAL SPECIMENS HUNG OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HE CARRIED A GREEN
BUTTERFLYNET IN ONE OF HIS HANDS
YOU WILL I AM SURE EXCUSE MY PRESUMPTION DR WATSON SAID HE AS
HE CAME PANTING UP TO WHERE I STOOD HERE ON THE MOOR WE ARE HOMELY
FOLK AND DO NOT WAIT FOR FORMAL INTRODUCTIONS YOU MAY POSSIBLY HAVE
HEARD MY NAME FROM OUR MUTUAL FRIEND MORTIMER I AM STAPLETON OF
MERRIPIT HOUSE
YOUR NET AND BOX WOULD HAVE TOLD ME AS MUCH SAID I FOR I KNEW
THAT MR STAPLETON WAS A NATURALIST BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW ME
I HAVE BEEN CALLING ON MORTIMER AND HE POINTED YOU OUT TO ME FROM
THE WINDOW OF HIS SURGERY AS YOU PASSED AS OUR ROAD LAY THE SAME WAY
I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD OVERTAKE YOU AND INTRODUCE MYSELF I TRUST
THAT SIR HENRY IS NONE THE WORSE FOR HIS JOURNEY
HE IS VERY WELL THANK YOU
WE WERE ALL RATHER AFRAID THAT AFTER THE SAD DEATH OF SIR CHARLES
THE NEW BARONET MIGHT REFUSE TO LIVE HERE IT IS ASKING MUCH OF A
WEALTHY MAN TO COME DOWN AND BURY HIMSELF IN A PLACE OF THIS KIND
BUT I NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT IT MEANS A VERY GREAT DEAL TO THE
COUNTRYSIDE SIR HENRY HAS I SUPPOSE NO SUPERSTITIOUS FEARS IN THE
MATTER
I DO NOT THINK THAT IT IS LIKELY
OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE LEGEND OF THE FIEND DOG WHICH HAUNTS THE
FAMILY
I HAVE HEARD IT
IT IS EXTRAORDINARY HOW CREDULOUS THE PEASANTS ARE ABOUT HERE ANY
NUMBER OF THEM ARE READY TO SWEAR THAT THEY HAVE SEEN SUCH A CREATURE
UPON THE MOOR HE SPOKE WITH A SMILE BUT I SEEMED TO READ IN HIS
EYES THAT HE TOOK THE MATTER MORE SERIOUSLY THE STORY TOOK A GREAT
HOLD UPON THE IMAGINATION OF SIR CHARLES AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT
LED TO HIS TRAGIC END
BUT HOW
HIS NERVES WERE SO WORKED UP THAT THE APPEARANCE OF ANY DOG MIGHT
HAVE HAD A FATAL EFFECT UPON HIS DISEASED HEART I FANCY THAT HE
REALLY DID SEE SOMETHING OF THE KIND UPON THAT LAST NIGHT IN THE YEW
ALLEY I FEARED THAT SOME DISASTER MIGHT OCCUR FOR I WAS VERY FOND
OF THE OLD MAN AND I KNEW THAT HIS HEART WAS WEAK
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT
MY FRIEND MORTIMER TOLD ME
YOU THINK THEN THAT SOME DOG PURSUED SIR CHARLES AND THAT HE DIED
OF FRIGHT IN CONSEQUENCE
HAVE YOU ANY BETTER EXPLANATION
I HAVE NOT COME TO ANY CONCLUSION
HAS MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
THE WORDS TOOK AWAY MY BREATH FOR AN INSTANT BUT A GLANCE AT THE
PLACID FACE AND STEADFAST EYES OF MY COMPANION SHOWED THAT NO
SURPRISE WAS INTENDED
IT IS USELESS FOR US TO PRETEND THAT WE DO NOT KNOW YOU DR
WATSON SAID HE THE RECORDS OF YOUR DETECTIVE HAVE REACHED US
HERE AND YOU COULD NOT CELEBRATE HIM WITHOUT BEING KNOWN YOURSELF
WHEN MORTIMER TOLD ME YOUR NAME HE COULD NOT DENY YOUR IDENTITY IF
YOU ARE HERE THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT MR SHERLOCK HOLMES IS INTERESTING
HIMSELF IN THE MATTER AND I AM NATURALLY CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT VIEW
HE MAY TAKE
I AM AFRAID THAT I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION
MAY I ASK IF HE IS GOING TO HONOUR US WITH A VISIT HIMSELF
HE CANNOT LEAVE TOWN AT PRESENT HE HAS OTHER CASES WHICH ENGAGE HIS
ATTENTION
WHAT A PITY HE MIGHT THROW SOME LIGHT ON THAT WHICH IS SO DARK TO
US BUT AS TO YOUR OWN RESEARCHES IF THERE IS ANY POSSIBLE WAY IN
WHICH I CAN BE OF SERVICE TO YOU I TRUST THAT YOU WILL COMMAND ME IF
I HAD ANY INDICATION OF THE NATURE OF YOUR SUSPICIONS OR HOW YOU
PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE CASE I MIGHT PERHAPS EVEN NOW GIVE YOU
SOME AID OR ADVICE
I ASSURE YOU THAT I AM SIMPLY HERE UPON A VISIT TO MY FRIEND SIR
HENRY AND THAT I NEED NO HELP OF ANY KIND
EXCELLENT SAID STAPLETON YOU ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT TO BE WARY AND
DISCREET I AM JUSTLY REPROVED FOR WHAT I FEEL WAS AN UNJUSTIFIABLE
INTRUSION AND I PROMISE YOU THAT I WILL NOT MENTION THE MATTER
AGAIN
WE HAD COME TO A POINT WHERE A NARROW GRASSY PATH STRUCK OFF FROM THE
ROAD AND WOUND AWAY ACROSS THE MOOR A STEEP BOULDERSPRINKLED HILL
LAY UPON THE RIGHT WHICH HAD IN BYGONE DAYS BEEN CUT INTO A GRANITE
QUARRY THE FACE WHICH WAS TURNED TOWARDS US FORMED A DARK CLIFF
WITH FERNS AND BRAMBLES GROWING IN ITS NICHES FROM OVER A DISTANT
RISE THERE FLOATED A GRAY PLUME OF SMOKE
A MODERATE WALK ALONG THIS MOORPATH BRINGS US TO MERRIPIT HOUSE
SAID HE PERHAPS YOU WILL SPARE AN HOUR THAT I MAY HAVE THE PLEASURE
OF INTRODUCING YOU TO MY SISTER
MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT I SHOULD BE BY SIR HENRYS SIDE BUT THEN I
REMEMBERED THE PILE OF PAPERS AND BILLS WITH WHICH HIS STUDY TABLE
WAS LITTERED IT WAS CERTAIN THAT I COULD NOT HELP WITH THOSE AND
HOLMES HAD EXPRESSLY SAID THAT I SHOULD STUDY THE NEIGHBOURS UPON THE
MOOR I ACCEPTED STAPLETONS INVITATION AND WE TURNED TOGETHER DOWN
THE PATH
IT IS A WONDERFUL PLACE THE MOOR SAID HE LOOKING ROUND OVER THE
UNDULATING DOWNS LONG GREEN ROLLERS WITH CRESTS OF JAGGED GRANITE
FOAMING UP INTO FANTASTIC SURGES YOU NEVER TIRE OF THE MOOR YOU
CANNOT THINK THE WONDERFUL SECRETS WHICH IT CONTAINS IT IS SO VAST
AND SO BARREN AND SO MYSTERIOUS
YOU KNOW IT WELL THEN
I HAVE ONLY BEEN HERE TWO YEARS THE RESIDENTS WOULD CALL ME A
NEWCOMER WE CAME SHORTLY AFTER SIR CHARLES SETTLED BUT MY TASTES
LED ME TO EXPLORE EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY ROUND AND I SHOULD THINK
THAT THERE ARE FEW MEN WHO KNOW IT BETTER THAN I DO
IS IT HARD TO KNOW
VERY HARD YOU SEE FOR EXAMPLE THIS GREAT PLAIN TO THE NORTH HERE
WITH THE QUEER HILLS BREAKING OUT OF IT DO YOU OBSERVE ANYTHING
REMARKABLE ABOUT THAT
IT WOULD BE A RARE PLACE FOR A GALLOP
YOU WOULD NATURALLY THINK SO AND THE THOUGHT HAS COST SEVERAL THEIR
LIVES BEFORE NOW YOU NOTICE THOSE BRIGHT GREEN SPOTS SCATTERED
THICKLY OVER IT
YES THEY SEEM MORE FERTILE THAN THE REST
STAPLETON LAUGHED
THAT IS THE GREAT GRIMPEN MIRE SAID HE A FALSE STEP YONDER MEANS
DEATH TO MAN OR BEAST ONLY YESTERDAY I SAW ONE OF THE MOOR PONIES
WANDER INTO IT HE NEVER CAME OUT I SAW HIS HEAD FOR QUITE A LONG
TIME CRANING OUT OF THE BOGHOLE BUT IT SUCKED HIM DOWN AT LAST
EVEN IN DRY SEASONS IT IS A DANGER TO CROSS IT BUT AFTER THESE
AUTUMN RAINS IT IS AN AWFUL PLACE AND YET I CAN FIND MY WAY TO THE
VERY HEART OF IT AND RETURN ALIVE BY GEORGE THERE IS ANOTHER OF
THOSE MISERABLE PONIES
SOMETHING BROWN WAS ROLLING AND TOSSING AMONG THE GREEN SEDGES THEN
A LONG AGONIZED WRITHING NECK SHOT UPWARD AND A DREADFUL CRY ECHOED
OVER THE MOOR IT TURNED ME COLD WITH HORROR BUT MY COMPANIONS
NERVES SEEMED TO BE STRONGER THAN MINE
ITS GONE SAID HE THE MIRE HAS HIM TWO IN TWO DAYS AND MANY
MORE PERHAPS FOR THEY GET IN THE WAY OF GOING THERE IN THE DRY
WEATHER AND NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE UNTIL THE MIRE HAS THEM IN ITS
CLUTCHES ITS A BAD PLACE THE GREAT GRIMPEN MIRE
AND YOU SAY YOU CAN PENETRATE IT
YES THERE ARE ONE OR TWO PATHS WHICH A VERY ACTIVE MAN CAN TAKE I
HAVE FOUND THEM OUT
BUT WHY SHOULD YOU WISH TO GO INTO SO HORRIBLE A PLACE
WELL YOU SEE THE HILLS BEYOND THEY ARE REALLY ISLANDS CUT OFF ON
ALL SIDES BY THE IMPASSABLE MIRE WHICH HAS CRAWLED ROUND THEM IN THE
COURSE OF YEARS THAT IS WHERE THE RARE PLANTS AND THE BUTTERFLIES
ARE IF YOU HAVE THE WIT TO REACH THEM
I SHALL TRY MY LUCK SOME DAY
HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A SURPRISED FACE
FOR GODS SAKE PUT SUCH AN IDEA OUT OF YOUR MIND SAID HE YOUR
BLOOD WOULD BE UPON MY HEAD I ASSURE YOU THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE THE
LEAST CHANCE OF YOUR COMING BACK ALIVE IT IS ONLY BY REMEMBERING
CERTAIN COMPLEX LANDMARKS THAT I AM ABLE TO DO IT
HALLOA I CRIED WHAT IS THAT
A LONG LOW MOAN INDESCRIBABLY SAD SWEPT OVER THE MOOR IT FILLED
THE WHOLE AIR AND YET IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHENCE IT CAME FROM
A DULL MURMUR IT SWELLED INTO A DEEP ROAR AND THEN SANK BACK INTO A
MELANCHOLY THROBBING MURMUR ONCE AGAIN STAPLETON LOOKED AT ME WITH
A CURIOUS EXPRESSION IN HIS FACE
QUEER PLACE THE MOOR SAID HE
BUT WHAT IS IT
THE PEASANTS SAY IT IS THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES CALLING FOR ITS
PREY IVE HEARD IT ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE BUT NEVER QUITE SO LOUD
I LOOKED ROUND WITH A CHILL OF FEAR IN MY HEART AT THE HUGE
SWELLING PLAIN MOTTLED WITH THE GREEN PATCHES OF RUSHES NOTHING
STIRRED OVER THE VAST EXPANSE SAVE A PAIR OF RAVENS WHICH CROAKED
LOUDLY FROM A TOR BEHIND US
YOU ARE AN EDUCATED MAN YOU DONT BELIEVE SUCH NONSENSE AS THAT
SAID I WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE CAUSE OF SO STRANGE A SOUND
BOGS MAKE QUEER NOISES SOMETIMES ITS THE MUD SETTLING OR THE
WATER RISING OR SOMETHING
NO NO THAT WAS A LIVING VOICE
WELL PERHAPS IT WAS DID YOU EVER HEAR A BITTERN BOOMING
NO I NEVER DID
ITS A VERY RARE BIRDPRACTICALLY EXTINCTIN ENGLAND NOW BUT ALL
THINGS ARE POSSIBLE UPON THE MOOR YES I SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO
LEARN THAT WHAT WE HAVE HEARD IS THE CRY OF THE LAST OF THE
BITTERNS
ITS THE WEIRDEST STRANGEST THING THAT EVER I HEARD IN MY LIFE
YES ITS RATHER AN UNCANNY PLACE ALTOGETHER LOOK AT THE HILLSIDE
YONDER WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THOSE
THE WHOLE STEEP SLOPE WAS COVERED WITH GRAY CIRCULAR RINGS OF STONE
A SCORE OF THEM AT LEAST
WHAT ARE THEY SHEEPPENS
NO THEY ARE THE HOMES OF OUR WORTHY ANCESTORS PREHISTORIC MAN
LIVED THICKLY ON THE MOOR AND AS NO ONE IN PARTICULAR HAS LIVED
THERE SINCE WE FIND ALL HIS LITTLE ARRANGEMENTS EXACTLY AS HE LEFT
THEM THESE ARE HIS WIGWAMS WITH THE ROOFS OFF YOU CAN EVEN SEE HIS
HEARTH AND HIS COUCH IF YOU HAVE THE CURIOSITY TO GO INSIDE
BUT IT IS QUITE A TOWN WHEN WAS IT INHABITED
NEOLITHIC MANNO DATE
WHAT DID HE DO
HE GRAZED HIS CATTLE ON THESE SLOPES AND HE LEARNED TO DIG FOR TIN
WHEN THE BRONZE SWORD BEGAN TO SUPERSEDE THE STONE AXE LOOK AT THE
GREAT TRENCH IN THE OPPOSITE HILL THAT IS HIS MARK YES YOU WILL
FIND SOME VERY SINGULAR POINTS ABOUT THE MOOR DR WATSON OH EXCUSE
ME AN INSTANT IT IS SURELY CYCLOPIDES
A SMALL FLY OR MOTH HAD FLUTTERED ACROSS OUR PATH AND IN AN INSTANT
STAPLETON WAS RUSHING WITH EXTRAORDINARY ENERGY AND SPEED IN PURSUIT
OF IT TO MY DISMAY THE CREATURE FLEW STRAIGHT FOR THE GREAT MIRE
AND MY ACQUAINTANCE NEVER PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT BOUNDING FROM TUFT
TO TUFT BEHIND IT HIS GREEN NET WAVING IN THE AIR HIS GRAY CLOTHES
AND JERKY ZIGZAG IRREGULAR PROGRESS MADE HIM NOT UNLIKE SOME HUGE
MOTH HIMSELF I WAS STANDING WATCHING HIS PURSUIT WITH A MIXTURE OF
ADMIRATION FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY ACTIVITY AND FEAR LEST HE SHOULD
LOSE HIS FOOTING IN THE TREACHEROUS MIRE WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF
STEPS AND TURNING ROUND FOUND A WOMAN NEAR ME UPON THE PATH SHE HAD
COME FROM THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE PLUME OF SMOKE INDICATED THE
POSITION OF MERRIPIT HOUSE BUT THE DIP OF THE MOOR HAD HID HER UNTIL
SHE WAS QUITE CLOSE
I COULD NOT DOUBT THAT THIS WAS THE MISS STAPLETON OF WHOM I HAD BEEN
TOLD SINCE LADIES OF ANY SORT MUST BE FEW UPON THE MOOR AND I
REMEMBERED THAT I HAD HEARD SOMEONE DESCRIBE HER AS BEING A BEAUTY
THE WOMAN WHO APPROACHED ME WAS CERTAINLY THAT AND OF A MOST
UNCOMMON TYPE THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A GREATER CONTRAST BETWEEN
BROTHER AND SISTER FOR STAPLETON WAS NEUTRAL TINTED WITH LIGHT HAIR
AND GRAY EYES WHILE SHE WAS DARKER THAN ANY BRUNETTE WHOM I HAVE
SEEN IN ENGLANDSLIM ELEGANT AND TALL SHE HAD A PROUD FINELY CUT
FACE SO REGULAR THAT IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED IMPASSIVE WERE IT NOT FOR
THE SENSITIVE MOUTH AND THE BEAUTIFUL DARK EAGER EYES WITH HER
PERFECT FIGURE AND ELEGANT DRESS SHE WAS INDEED A STRANGE
APPARITION UPON A LONELY MOORLAND PATH HER EYES WERE ON HER BROTHER
AS I TURNED AND THEN SHE QUICKENED HER PACE TOWARDS ME I HAD RAISED
MY HAT AND WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME EXPLANATORY REMARK WHEN HER OWN
WORDS TURNED ALL MY THOUGHTS INTO A NEW CHANNEL
GO BACK SHE SAID GO STRAIGHT BACK TO LONDON INSTANTLY
I COULD ONLY STARE AT HER IN STUPID SURPRISE HER EYES BLAZED AT ME
AND SHE TAPPED THE GROUND IMPATIENTLY WITH HER FOOT
WHY SHOULD I GO BACK I ASKED
I CANNOT EXPLAIN SHE SPOKE IN A LOW EAGER VOICE WITH A CURIOUS
LISP IN HER UTTERANCE BUT FOR GODS SAKE DO WHAT I ASK YOU GO BACK
AND NEVER SET FOOT UPON THE MOOR AGAIN
BUT I HAVE ONLY JUST COME
MAN MAN SHE CRIED CAN YOU NOT TELL WHEN A WARNING IS FOR YOUR
OWN GOOD GO BACK TO LONDON START TONIGHT GET AWAY FROM THIS PLACE
AT ALL COSTS HUSH MY BROTHER IS COMING NOT A WORD OF WHAT I HAVE
SAID WOULD YOU MIND GETTING THAT ORCHID FOR ME AMONG THE MARESTAILS
YONDER WE ARE VERY RICH IN ORCHIDS ON THE MOOR THOUGH OF COURSE
YOU ARE RATHER LATE TO SEE THE BEAUTIES OF THE PLACE
STAPLETON HAD ABANDONED THE CHASE AND CAME BACK TO US BREATHING HARD
AND FLUSHED WITH HIS EXERTIONS
HALLOA BERYL SAID HE AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE TONE OF HIS
GREETING WAS NOT ALTOGETHER A CORDIAL ONE
WELL JACK YOU ARE VERY HOT
YES I WAS CHASING A CYCLOPIDES HE IS VERY RARE AND SELDOM FOUND IN
THE LATE AUTUMN WHAT A PITY THAT I SHOULD HAVE MISSED HIM HE SPOKE
UNCONCERNEDLY BUT HIS SMALL LIGHT EYES GLANCED INCESSANTLY FROM THE
GIRL TO ME
YOU HAVE INTRODUCED YOURSELVES I CAN SEE
YES I WAS TELLING SIR HENRY THAT IT WAS RATHER LATE FOR HIM TO SEE
THE TRUE BEAUTIES OF THE MOOR
WHY WHO DO YOU THINK THIS IS
I IMAGINE THAT IT MUST BE SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE
NO NO SAID I ONLY A HUMBLE COMMONER BUT HIS FRIEND MY NAME IS
DR WATSON
A FLUSH OF VEXATION PASSED OVER HER EXPRESSIVE FACE WE HAVE BEEN
TALKING AT CROSS PURPOSES SAID SHE
WHY YOU HAD NOT VERY MUCH TIME FOR TALK HER BROTHER REMARKED WITH
THE SAME QUESTIONING EYES
I TALKED AS IF DR WATSON WERE A RESIDENT INSTEAD OF BEING MERELY A
VISITOR SAID SHE IT CANNOT MUCH MATTER TO HIM WHETHER IT IS EARLY
OR LATE FOR THE ORCHIDS BUT YOU WILL COME ON WILL YOU NOT AND SEE
MERRIPIT HOUSE
A SHORT WALK BROUGHT US TO IT A BLEAK MOORLAND HOUSE ONCE THE FARM
OF SOME GRAZIER IN THE OLD PROSPEROUS DAYS BUT NOW PUT INTO REPAIR
AND TURNED INTO A MODERN DWELLING AN ORCHARD SURROUNDED IT BUT THE
TREES AS IS USUAL UPON THE MOOR WERE STUNTED AND NIPPED AND THE
EFFECT OF THE WHOLE PLACE WAS MEAN AND MELANCHOLY WE WERE ADMITTED
BY A STRANGE WIZENED RUSTYCOATED OLD MANSERVANT WHO SEEMED IN
KEEPING WITH THE HOUSE INSIDE HOWEVER THERE WERE LARGE ROOMS
FURNISHED WITH AN ELEGANCE IN WHICH I SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE THE TASTE
OF THE LADY AS I LOOKED FROM THEIR WINDOWS AT THE INTERMINABLE
GRANITEFLECKED MOOR ROLLING UNBROKEN TO THE FARTHEST HORIZON I COULD
NOT BUT MARVEL AT WHAT COULD HAVE BROUGHT THIS HIGHLY EDUCATED MAN
AND THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN TO LIVE IN SUCH A PLACE
QUEER SPOT TO CHOOSE IS IT NOT SAID HE AS IF IN ANSWER TO MY
THOUGHT AND YET WE MANAGE TO MAKE OURSELVES FAIRLY HAPPY DO WE
NOT BERYL
QUITE HAPPY SAID SHE BUT THERE WAS NO RING OF CONVICTION IN HER
WORDS
I HAD A SCHOOL SAID STAPLETON IT WAS IN THE NORTH COUNTRY THE
WORK TO A MAN OF MY TEMPERAMENT WAS MECHANICAL AND UNINTERESTING BUT
THE PRIVILEGE OF LIVING WITH YOUTH OF HELPING TO MOULD THOSE YOUNG
MINDS AND OF IMPRESSING THEM WITH ONES OWN CHARACTER AND IDEALS
WAS VERY DEAR TO ME HOWEVER THE FATES WERE AGAINST US A SERIOUS
EPIDEMIC BROKE OUT IN THE SCHOOL AND THREE OF THE BOYS DIED IT NEVER
RECOVERED FROM THE BLOW AND MUCH OF MY CAPITAL WAS IRRETRIEVABLY
SWALLOWED UP AND YET IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE LOSS OF THE CHARMING
COMPANIONSHIP OF THE BOYS I COULD REJOICE OVER MY OWN MISFORTUNE
FOR WITH MY STRONG TASTES FOR BOTANY AND ZOOLOGY I FIND AN
UNLIMITED FIELD OF WORK HERE AND MY SISTER IS AS DEVOTED TO NATURE
AS I AM ALL THIS DR WATSON HAS BEEN BROUGHT UPON YOUR HEAD BY
YOUR EXPRESSION AS YOU SURVEYED THE MOOR OUT OF OUR WINDOW
IT CERTAINLY DID CROSS MY MIND THAT IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE DULLLESS
FOR YOU PERHAPS THAN FOR YOUR SISTER
NO NO I AM NEVER DULL SAID SHE QUICKLY
WE HAVE BOOKS WE HAVE OUR STUDIES AND WE HAVE INTERESTING
NEIGHBOURS DR MORTIMER IS A MOST LEARNED MAN IN HIS OWN LINE POOR
SIR CHARLES WAS ALSO AN ADMIRABLE COMPANION WE KNEW HIM WELL AND
MISS HIM MORE THAN I CAN TELL DO YOU THINK THAT I SHOULD INTRUDE IF
I WERE TO CALL THIS AFTERNOON AND MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF SIR
HENRY
I AM SURE THAT HE WOULD BE DELIGHTED
THEN PERHAPS YOU WOULD MENTION THAT I PROPOSE TO DO SO WE MAY IN
OUR HUMBLE WAY DO SOMETHING TO MAKE THINGS MORE EASY FOR HIM UNTIL HE
BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO HIS NEW SURROUNDINGS WILL YOU COME UPSTAIRS
DR WATSON AND INSPECT MY COLLECTION OF LEPIDOPTERA I THINK IT IS
THE MOST COMPLETE ONE IN THE SOUTHWEST OF ENGLAND BY THE TIME THAT
YOU HAVE LOOKED THROUGH THEM LUNCH WILL BE ALMOST READY
BUT I WAS EAGER TO GET BACK TO MY CHARGE THE MELANCHOLY OF THE MOOR
THE DEATH OF THE UNFORTUNATE PONY THE WEIRD SOUND WHICH HAD BEEN
ASSOCIATED WITH THE GRIM LEGEND OF THE BASKERVILLES ALL THESE THINGS
TINGED MY THOUGHTS WITH SADNESS THEN ON THE TOP OF THESE MORE OR
LESS VAGUE IMPRESSIONS THERE HAD COME THE DEFINITE AND DISTINCT
WARNING OF MISS STAPLETON DELIVERED WITH SUCH INTENSE EARNESTNESS
THAT I COULD NOT DOUBT THAT SOME GRAVE AND DEEP REASON LAY BEHIND IT
I RESISTED ALL PRESSURE TO STAY FOR LUNCH AND I SET OFF AT ONCE UPON
MY RETURN JOURNEY TAKING THE GRASSGROWN PATH BY WHICH WE HAD COME
IT SEEMS HOWEVER THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME SHORT CUT FOR THOSE
WHO KNEW IT FOR BEFORE I HAD REACHED THE ROAD I WAS ASTOUNDED TO SEE
MISS STAPLETON SITTING UPON A ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE TRACK HER FACE
WAS BEAUTIFULLY FLUSHED WITH HER EXERTIONS AND SHE HELD HER HAND TO
HER SIDE
I HAVE RUN ALL THE WAY IN ORDER TO CUT YOU OFF DR WATSON SAID
SHE I HAD NOT EVEN TIME TO PUT ON MY HAT I MUST NOT STOP OR MY
BROTHER MAY MISS ME I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU HOW SORRY I AM ABOUT THE
STUPID MISTAKE I MADE IN THINKING THAT YOU WERE SIR HENRY PLEASE
FORGET THE WORDS I SAID WHICH HAVE NO APPLICATION WHATEVER TO YOU
BUT I CANT FORGET THEM MISS STAPLETON SAID I I AM SIR HENRYS
FRIEND AND HIS WELFARE IS A VERY CLOSE CONCERN OF MINE TELL ME WHY
IT WAS THAT YOU WERE SO EAGER THAT SIR HENRY SHOULD RETURN TO
LONDON
A WOMANS WHIM DR WATSON WHEN YOU KNOW ME BETTER YOU WILL
UNDERSTAND THAT I CANNOT ALWAYS GIVE REASONS FOR WHAT I SAY OR DO
NO NO I REMEMBER THE THRILL IN YOUR VOICE I REMEMBER THE LOOK IN
YOUR EYES PLEASE PLEASE BE FRANK WITH ME MISS STAPLETON FOR EVER
SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE I HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF SHADOWS ALL ROUND ME
LIFE HAS BECOME LIKE THAT GREAT GRIMPEN MIRE WITH LITTLE GREEN
PATCHES EVERYWHERE INTO WHICH ONE MAY SINK AND WITH NO GUIDE TO POINT
THE TRACK TELL ME THEN WHAT IT WAS THAT YOU MEANT AND I WILL
PROMISE TO CONVEY YOUR WARNING TO SIR HENRY
AN EXPRESSION OF IRRESOLUTION PASSED FOR AN INSTANT OVER HER FACE
BUT HER EYES HAD HARDENED AGAIN WHEN SHE ANSWERED ME
YOU MAKE TOO MUCH OF IT DR WATSON SAID SHE MY BROTHER AND I
WERE VERY MUCH SHOCKED BY THE DEATH OF SIR CHARLES WE KNEW HIM VERY
INTIMATELY FOR HIS FAVOURITE WALK WAS OVER THE MOOR TO OUR HOUSE HE
WAS DEEPLY IMPRESSED WITH THE CURSE WHICH HUNG OVER THE FAMILY AND
WHEN THIS TRAGEDY CAME I NATURALLY FELT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME
GROUNDS FOR THE FEARS WHICH HE HAD EXPRESSED I WAS DISTRESSED
THEREFORE WHEN ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CAME DOWN TO LIVE HERE
AND I FELT THAT HE SHOULD BE WARNED OF THE DANGER WHICH HE WILL RUN
THAT WAS ALL WHICH I INTENDED TO CONVEY
BUT WHAT IS THE DANGER
YOU KNOW THE STORY OF THE HOUND
I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH NONSENSE
BUT I DO IF YOU HAVE ANY INFLUENCE WITH SIR HENRY TAKE HIM AWAY
FROM A PLACE WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN FATAL TO HIS FAMILY THE WORLD IS
WIDE WHY SHOULD HE WISH TO LIVE AT THE PLACE OF DANGER
BECAUSE IT IS THE PLACE OF DANGER THAT IS SIR HENRYS NATURE I
FEAR THAT UNLESS YOU CAN GIVE ME SOME MORE DEFINITE INFORMATION THAN
THIS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HIM TO MOVE
I CANNOT SAY ANYTHING DEFINITE FOR I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING
DEFINITE
I WOULD ASK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION MISS STAPLETON IF YOU MEANT NO
MORE THAN THIS WHEN YOU FIRST SPOKE TO ME WHY SHOULD YOU NOT WISH
YOUR BROTHER TO OVERHEAR WHAT YOU SAID THERE IS NOTHING TO WHICH HE
OR ANYONE ELSE COULD OBJECT
MY BROTHER IS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE THE HALL INHABITED FOR HE THINKS
IT IS FOR THE GOOD OF THE POOR FOLK UPON THE MOOR HE WOULD BE VERY
ANGRY IF HE KNEW THAT I HAVE SAID ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT INDUCE SIR
HENRY TO GO AWAY BUT I HAVE DONE MY DUTY NOW AND I WILL SAY NO MORE
I MUST GET BACK OR HE WILL MISS ME AND SUSPECT THAT I HAVE SEEN YOU
GOODBYE SHE TURNED AND HAD DISAPPEARED IN A FEW MINUTES AMONG THE
SCATTERED BOULDERS WHILE I WITH MY SOUL FULL OF VAGUE FEARS
PURSUED MY WAY TO BASKERVILLE HALL
CHAPTER VIII
FIRST REPORT OF DR WATSON
FROM THIS POINT ONWARD I WILL FOLLOW THE COURSE OF EVENTS BY
TRANSCRIBING MY OWN LETTERS TO MR SHERLOCK HOLMES WHICH LIE BEFORE
ME ON THE TABLE ONE PAGE IS MISSING BUT OTHERWISE THEY ARE EXACTLY
AS WRITTEN AND SHOW MY FEELINGS AND SUSPICIONS OF THE MOMENT MORE
ACCURATELY THAN MY MEMORY CLEAR AS IT IS UPON THESE TRAGIC EVENTS
CAN POSSIBLY DO
BASKERVILLE HALL OCTOBER TH
MY DEAR HOLMES
MY PREVIOUS LETTERS AND TELEGRAMS HAVE KEPT YOU PRETTY WELL UP TO
DATE AS TO ALL THAT HAS OCCURRED IN THIS MOST GODFORSAKEN CORNER OF
THE WORLD THE LONGER ONE STAYS HERE THE MORE DOES THE SPIRIT OF THE
MOOR SINK INTO ONES SOUL ITS VASTNESS AND ALSO ITS GRIM CHARM
WHEN YOU ARE ONCE OUT UPON ITS BOSOM YOU HAVE LEFT ALL TRACES OF
MODERN ENGLAND BEHIND YOU BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU ARE CONSCIOUS
EVERYWHERE OF THE HOMES AND THE WORK OF THE PREHISTORIC PEOPLE ON
ALL SIDES OF YOU AS YOU WALK ARE THE HOUSES OF THESE FORGOTTEN FOLK
WITH THEIR GRAVES AND THE HUGE MONOLITHS WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
MARKED THEIR TEMPLES AS YOU LOOK AT THEIR GRAY STONE HUTS AGAINST
THE SCARRED HILLSIDES YOU LEAVE YOUR OWN AGE BEHIND YOU AND IF YOU
WERE TO SEE A SKINCLAD HAIRY MAN CRAWL OUT FROM THE LOW DOOR
FITTING A FLINTTIPPED ARROW ON TO THE STRING OF HIS BOW YOU WOULD
FEEL THAT HIS PRESENCE THERE WAS MORE NATURAL THAN YOUR OWN THE
STRANGE THING IS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE LIVED SO THICKLY ON WHAT MUST
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN MOST UNFRUITFUL SOIL I AM NO ANTIQUARIAN BUT I
COULD IMAGINE THAT THEY WERE SOME UNWARLIKE AND HARRIED RACE WHO WERE
FORCED TO ACCEPT THAT WHICH NONE OTHER WOULD OCCUPY
ALL THIS HOWEVER IS FOREIGN TO THE MISSION ON WHICH YOU SENT ME AND
WILL PROBABLY BE VERY UNINTERESTING TO YOUR SEVERELY PRACTICAL MIND
I CAN STILL REMEMBER YOUR COMPLETE INDIFFERENCE AS TO WHETHER THE SUN
MOVED ROUND THE EARTH OR THE EARTH ROUND THE SUN LET ME THEREFORE
RETURN TO THE FACTS CONCERNING SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE
IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY REPORT WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS IT IS BECAUSE
UP TO TODAY THERE WAS NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE TO RELATE THEN A VERY
SURPRISING CIRCUMSTANCE OCCURRED WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU IN DUE
COURSE BUT FIRST OF ALL I MUST KEEP YOU IN TOUCH WITH SOME OF THE
OTHER FACTORS IN THE SITUATION
ONE OF THESE CONCERNING WHICH I HAVE SAID LITTLE IS THE ESCAPED
CONVICT UPON THE MOOR THERE IS STRONG REASON NOW TO BELIEVE THAT HE
HAS GOT RIGHT AWAY WHICH IS A CONSIDERABLE RELIEF TO THE LONELY
HOUSEHOLDERS OF THIS DISTRICT A FORTNIGHT HAS PASSED SINCE HIS
FLIGHT DURING WHICH HE HAS NOT BEEN SEEN AND NOTHING HAS BEEN HEARD
OF HIM IT IS SURELY INCONCEIVABLE THAT HE COULD HAVE HELD OUT UPON
THE MOOR DURING ALL THAT TIME OF COURSE SO FAR AS HIS CONCEALMENT
GOES THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY AT ALL ANY ONE OF THESE STONE HUTS WOULD
GIVE HIM A HIDINGPLACE BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO EAT UNLESS HE WERE
TO CATCH AND SLAUGHTER ONE OF THE MOOR SHEEP WE THINK THEREFORE
THAT HE HAS GONE AND THE OUTLYING FARMERS SLEEP THE BETTER IN
CONSEQUENCE
WE ARE FOUR ABLEBODIED MEN IN THIS HOUSEHOLD SO THAT WE COULD TAKE
GOOD CARE OF OURSELVES BUT I CONFESS THAT I HAVE HAD UNEASY MOMENTS
WHEN I HAVE THOUGHT OF THE STAPLETONS THEY LIVE MILES FROM ANY HELP
THERE ARE ONE MAID AN OLD MANSERVANT THE SISTER AND THE BROTHER
THE LATTER NOT A VERY STRONG MAN THEY WOULD BE HELPLESS IN THE HANDS
OF A DESPERATE FELLOW LIKE THIS NOTTING HILL CRIMINAL IF HE COULD
ONCE EFFECT AN ENTRANCE BOTH SIR HENRY AND I WERE CONCERNED AT THEIR
SITUATION AND IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT PERKINS THE GROOM SHOULD GO OVER
TO SLEEP THERE BUT STAPLETON WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT
THE FACT IS THAT OUR FRIEND THE BARONET BEGINS TO DISPLAY A
CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN OUR FAIR NEIGHBOUR IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED
AT FOR TIME HANGS HEAVILY IN THIS LONELY SPOT TO AN ACTIVE MAN LIKE
HIM AND SHE IS A VERY FASCINATING AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN THERE IS
SOMETHING TROPICAL AND EXOTIC ABOUT HER WHICH FORMS A SINGULAR
CONTRAST TO HER COOL AND UNEMOTIONAL BROTHER YET HE ALSO GIVES THE
IDEA OF HIDDEN FIRES HE HAS CERTAINLY A VERY MARKED INFLUENCE OVER
HER FOR I HAVE SEEN HER CONTINUALLY GLANCE AT HIM AS SHE TALKED AS
IF SEEKING APPROBATION FOR WHAT SHE SAID I TRUST THAT HE IS KIND TO
HER THERE IS A DRY GLITTER IN HIS EYES AND A FIRM SET OF HIS THIN
LIPS WHICH GOES WITH A POSITIVE AND POSSIBLY A HARSH NATURE YOU
WOULD FIND HIM AN INTERESTING STUDY
HE CAME OVER TO CALL UPON BASKERVILLE ON THAT FIRST DAY AND THE VERY
NEXT MORNING HE TOOK US BOTH TO SHOW US THE SPOT WHERE THE LEGEND OF
THE WICKED HUGO IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE HAD ITS ORIGIN IT WAS AN
EXCURSION OF SOME MILES ACROSS THE MOOR TO A PLACE WHICH IS SO DISMAL
THAT IT MIGHT HAVE SUGGESTED THE STORY WE FOUND A SHORT VALLEY
BETWEEN RUGGED TORS WHICH LED TO AN OPEN GRASSY SPACE FLECKED OVER
WITH THE WHITE COTTON GRASS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ROSE TWO GREAT
STONES WORN AND SHARPENED AT THE UPPER END UNTIL THEY LOOKED LIKE
THE HUGE CORRODING FANGS OF SOME MONSTROUS BEAST IN EVERY WAY IT
CORRESPONDED WITH THE SCENE OF THE OLD TRAGEDY SIR HENRY WAS MUCH
INTERESTED AND ASKED STAPLETON MORE THAN ONCE WHETHER HE DID REALLY
BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF THE INTERFERENCE OF THE SUPERNATURAL IN
THE AFFAIRS OF MEN HE SPOKE LIGHTLY BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS
VERY MUCH IN EARNEST STAPLETON WAS GUARDED IN HIS REPLIES BUT IT
WAS EASY TO SEE THAT HE SAID LESS THAN HE MIGHT AND THAT HE WOULD
NOT EXPRESS HIS WHOLE OPINION OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR THE FEELINGS
OF THE BARONET HE TOLD US OF SIMILAR CASES WHERE FAMILIES HAD
SUFFERED FROM SOME EVIL INFLUENCE AND HE LEFT US WITH THE IMPRESSION
THAT HE SHARED THE POPULAR VIEW UPON THE MATTER
ON OUR WAY BACK WE STAYED FOR LUNCH AT MERRIPIT HOUSE AND IT WAS
THERE THAT SIR HENRY MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MISS STAPLETON FROM
THE FIRST MOMENT THAT HE SAW HER HE APPEARED TO BE STRONGLY ATTRACTED
BY HER AND I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF THE FEELING WAS NOT MUTUAL HE
REFERRED TO HER AGAIN AND AGAIN ON OUR WALK HOME AND SINCE THEN
HARDLY A DAY HAS PASSED THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN SOMETHING OF THE
BROTHER AND SISTER THEY DINE HERE TONIGHT AND THERE IS SOME TALK
OF OUR GOING TO THEM NEXT WEEK ONE WOULD IMAGINE THAT SUCH A MATCH
WOULD BE VERY WELCOME TO STAPLETON AND YET I HAVE MORE THAN ONCE
CAUGHT A LOOK OF THE STRONGEST DISAPPROBATION IN HIS FACE WHEN SIR
HENRY HAS BEEN PAYING SOME ATTENTION TO HIS SISTER HE IS MUCH
ATTACHED TO HER NO DOUBT AND WOULD LEAD A LONELY LIFE WITHOUT HER
BUT IT WOULD SEEM THE HEIGHT OF SELFISHNESS IF HE WERE TO STAND IN
THE WAY OF HER MAKING SO BRILLIANT A MARRIAGE YET I AM CERTAIN THAT
HE DOES NOT WISH THEIR INTIMACY TO RIPEN INTO LOVE AND I HAVE
SEVERAL TIMES OBSERVED THAT HE HAS TAKEN PAINS TO PREVENT THEM FROM
BEING TTE TTE BY THE WAY YOUR INSTRUCTIONS TO ME NEVER TO ALLOW
SIR HENRY TO GO OUT ALONE WILL BECOME VERY MUCH MORE ONEROUS IF A
LOVE AFFAIR WERE TO BE ADDED TO OUR OTHER DIFFICULTIES MY POPULARITY
WOULD SOON SUFFER IF I WERE TO CARRY OUT YOUR ORDERS TO THE LETTER
THE OTHER DAYTHURSDAY TO BE MORE EXACTDR MORTIMER LUNCHED WITH
US HE HAS BEEN EXCAVATING A BARROW AT LONG DOWN AND HAS GOT A
PREHISTORIC SKULL WHICH FILLS HIM WITH GREAT JOY NEVER WAS THERE
SUCH A SINGLEMINDED ENTHUSIAST AS HE THE STAPLETONS CAME IN
AFTERWARDS AND THE GOOD DOCTOR TOOK US ALL TO THE YEW ALLEY AT SIR
HENRYS REQUEST TO SHOW US EXACTLY HOW EVERYTHING OCCURRED UPON THAT
FATAL NIGHT IT IS A LONG DISMAL WALK THE YEW ALLEY BETWEEN TWO
HIGH WALLS OF CLIPPED HEDGE WITH A NARROW BAND OF GRASS UPON EITHER
SIDE AT THE FAR END IS AN OLD TUMBLEDOWN SUMMERHOUSE HALFWAY
DOWN IS THE MOORGATE WHERE THE OLD GENTLEMAN LEFT HIS CIGARASH IT
IS A WHITE WOODEN GATE WITH A LATCH BEYOND IT LIES THE WIDE MOOR I
REMEMBERED YOUR THEORY OF THE AFFAIR AND TRIED TO PICTURE ALL THAT
HAD OCCURRED AS THE OLD MAN STOOD THERE HE SAW SOMETHING COMING
ACROSS THE MOOR SOMETHING WHICH TERRIFIED HIM SO THAT HE LOST HIS
WITS AND RAN AND RAN UNTIL HE DIED OF SHEER HORROR AND EXHAUSTION
THERE WAS THE LONG GLOOMY TUNNEL DOWN WHICH HE FLED AND FROM WHAT
A SHEEPDOG OF THE MOOR OR A SPECTRAL HOUND BLACK SILENT AND
MONSTROUS WAS THERE A HUMAN AGENCY IN THE MATTER DID THE PALE
WATCHFUL BARRYMORE KNOW MORE THAN HE CARED TO SAY IT WAS ALL DIM AND
VAGUE BUT ALWAYS THERE IS THE DARK SHADOW OF CRIME BEHIND IT
ONE OTHER NEIGHBOUR I HAVE MET SINCE I WROTE LAST THIS IS MR
FRANKLAND OF LAFTER HALL WHO LIVES SOME FOUR MILES TO THE SOUTH OF
US HE IS AN ELDERLY MAN REDFACED WHITEHAIRED AND CHOLERIC HIS
PASSION IS FOR THE BRITISH LAW AND HE HAS SPENT A LARGE FORTUNE IN
LITIGATION HE FIGHTS FOR THE MERE PLEASURE OF FIGHTING AND IS
EQUALLY READY TO TAKE UP EITHER SIDE OF A QUESTION SO THAT IT IS NO
WONDER THAT HE HAS FOUND IT A COSTLY AMUSEMENT SOMETIMES HE WILL
SHUT UP A RIGHT OF WAY AND DEFY THE PARISH TO MAKE HIM OPEN IT AT
OTHERS HE WILL WITH HIS OWN HANDS TEAR DOWN SOME OTHER MANS GATE AND
DECLARE THAT A PATH HAS EXISTED THERE FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL DEFYING
THE OWNER TO PROSECUTE HIM FOR TRESPASS HE IS LEARNED IN OLD
MANORIAL AND COMMUNAL RIGHTS AND HE APPLIES HIS KNOWLEDGE SOMETIMES
IN FAVOUR OF THE VILLAGERS OF FERNWORTHY AND SOMETIMES AGAINST THEM
SO THAT HE IS PERIODICALLY EITHER CARRIED IN TRIUMPH DOWN THE VILLAGE
STREET OR ELSE BURNED IN EFFIGY ACCORDING TO HIS LATEST EXPLOIT HE
IS SAID TO HAVE ABOUT SEVEN LAWSUITS UPON HIS HANDS AT PRESENT WHICH
WILL PROBABLY SWALLOW UP THE REMAINDER OF HIS FORTUNE AND SO DRAW HIS
STING AND LEAVE HIM HARMLESS FOR THE FUTURE APART FROM THE LAW HE
SEEMS A KINDLY GOODNATURED PERSON AND I ONLY MENTION HIM BECAUSE
YOU WERE PARTICULAR THAT I SHOULD SEND SOME DESCRIPTION OF THE PEOPLE
WHO SURROUND US HE IS CURIOUSLY EMPLOYED AT PRESENT FOR BEING AN
AMATEUR ASTRONOMER HE HAS AN EXCELLENT TELESCOPE WITH WHICH HE LIES
UPON THE ROOF OF HIS OWN HOUSE AND SWEEPS THE MOOR ALL DAY IN THE
HOPE OF CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF THE ESCAPED CONVICT IF HE WOULD
CONFINE HIS ENERGIES TO THIS ALL WOULD BE WELL BUT THERE ARE RUMOURS
THAT HE INTENDS TO PROSECUTE DR MORTIMER FOR OPENING A GRAVE WITHOUT
THE CONSENT OF THE NEXTOFKIN BECAUSE HE DUG UP THE NEOLITHIC SKULL
IN THE BARROW ON LONG DOWN HE HELPS TO KEEP OUR LIVES FROM BEING
MONOTONOUS AND GIVES A LITTLE COMIC RELIEF WHERE IT IS BADLY NEEDED
AND NOW HAVING BROUGHT YOU UP TO DATE IN THE ESCAPED CONVICT THE
STAPLETONS DR MORTIMER AND FRANKLAND OF LAFTER HALL LET ME END
ON THAT WHICH IS MOST IMPORTANT AND TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THE
BARRYMORES AND ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE SURPRISING DEVELOPMENT OF LAST
NIGHT
FIRST OF ALL ABOUT THE TEST TELEGRAM WHICH YOU SENT FROM LONDON IN
ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT BARRYMORE WAS REALLY HERE I HAVE ALREADY
EXPLAINED THAT THE TESTIMONY OF THE POSTMASTER SHOWS THAT THE TEST
WAS WORTHLESS AND THAT WE HAVE NO PROOF ONE WAY OR THE OTHER I TOLD
SIR HENRY HOW THE MATTER STOOD AND HE AT ONCE IN HIS DOWNRIGHT
FASHION HAD BARRYMORE UP AND ASKED HIM WHETHER HE HAD RECEIVED THE
TELEGRAM HIMSELF BARRYMORE SAID THAT HE HAD
DID THE BOY DELIVER IT INTO YOUR OWN HANDS ASKED SIR HENRY
BARRYMORE LOOKED SURPRISED AND CONSIDERED FOR A LITTLE TIME
NO SAID HE I WAS IN THE BOXROOM AT THE TIME AND MY WIFE
BROUGHT IT UP TO ME
DID YOU ANSWER IT YOURSELF
NO I TOLD MY WIFE WHAT TO ANSWER AND SHE WENT DOWN TO WRITE IT
IN THE EVENING HE RECURRED TO THE SUBJECT OF HIS OWN ACCORD
I COULD NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND THE OBJECT OF YOUR QUESTIONS THIS
MORNING SIR HENRY SAID HE I TRUST THAT THEY DO NOT MEAN THAT I
HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO FORFEIT YOUR CONFIDENCE
SIR HENRY HAD TO ASSURE HIM THAT IT WAS NOT SO AND PACIFY HIM BY
GIVING HIM A CONSIDERABLE PART OF HIS OLD WARDROBE THE LONDON OUTFIT
HAVING NOW ALL ARRIVED
MRS BARRYMORE IS OF INTEREST TO ME SHE IS A HEAVY SOLID PERSON
VERY LIMITED INTENSELY RESPECTABLE AND INCLINED TO BE PURITANICAL
YOU COULD HARDLY CONCEIVE A LESS EMOTIONAL SUBJECT YET I HAVE TOLD
YOU HOW ON THE FIRST NIGHT HERE I HEARD HER SOBBING BITTERLY AND
SINCE THEN I HAVE MORE THAN ONCE OBSERVED TRACES OF TEARS UPON HER
FACE SOME DEEP SORROW GNAWS EVER AT HER HEART SOMETIMES I WONDER IF
SHE HAS A GUILTY MEMORY WHICH HAUNTS HER AND SOMETIMES I SUSPECT
BARRYMORE OF BEING A DOMESTIC TYRANT I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THERE
WAS SOMETHING SINGULAR AND QUESTIONABLE IN THIS MANS CHARACTER BUT
THE ADVENTURE OF LAST NIGHT BRINGS ALL MY SUSPICIONS TO A HEAD
AND YET IT MAY SEEM A SMALL MATTER IN ITSELF YOU ARE AWARE THAT I AM
NOT A VERY SOUND SLEEPER AND SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON GUARD IN THIS
HOUSE MY SLUMBERS HAVE BEEN LIGHTER THAN EVER LAST NIGHT ABOUT TWO
IN THE MORNING I WAS AROUSED BY A STEALTHY STEP PASSING MY ROOM I
ROSE OPENED MY DOOR AND PEEPED OUT A LONG BLACK SHADOW WAS
TRAILING DOWN THE CORRIDOR IT WAS THROWN BY A MAN WHO WALKED SOFTLY
DOWN THE PASSAGE WITH A CANDLE HELD IN HIS HAND HE WAS IN SHIRT AND
TROUSERS WITH NO COVERING TO HIS FEET I COULD MERELY SEE THE
OUTLINE BUT HIS HEIGHT TOLD ME THAT IT WAS BARRYMORE HE WALKED VERY
SLOWLY AND CIRCUMSPECTLY AND THERE WAS SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY
GUILTY AND FURTIVE IN HIS WHOLE APPEARANCE
I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THE CORRIDOR IS BROKEN BY THE BALCONY WHICH RUNS
ROUND THE HALL BUT THAT IT IS RESUMED UPON THE FARTHER SIDE I
WAITED UNTIL HE HAD PASSED OUT OF SIGHT AND THEN I FOLLOWED HIM WHEN
I CAME ROUND THE BALCONY HE HAD REACHED THE END OF THE FARTHER
CORRIDOR AND I COULD SEE FROM THE GLIMMER OF LIGHT THROUGH AN OPEN
DOOR THAT HE HAD ENTERED ONE OF THE ROOMS NOW ALL THESE ROOMS ARE
UNFURNISHED AND UNOCCUPIED SO THAT HIS EXPEDITION BECAME MORE
MYSTERIOUS THAN EVER THE LIGHT SHONE STEADILY AS IF HE WERE STANDING
MOTIONLESS I CREPT DOWN THE PASSAGE AS NOISELESSLY AS I COULD AND
PEEPED ROUND THE CORNER OF THE DOOR
BARRYMORE WAS CROUCHING AT THE WINDOW WITH THE CANDLE HELD AGAINST
THE GLASS HIS PROFILE WAS HALF TURNED TOWARDS ME AND HIS FACE
SEEMED TO BE RIGID WITH EXPECTATION AS HE STARED OUT INTO THE
BLACKNESS OF THE MOOR FOR SOME MINUTES HE STOOD WATCHING INTENTLY
THEN HE GAVE A DEEP GROAN AND WITH AN IMPATIENT GESTURE HE PUT OUT
THE LIGHT INSTANTLY I MADE MY WAY BACK TO MY ROOM AND VERY SHORTLY
CAME THE STEALTHY STEPS PASSING ONCE MORE UPON THEIR RETURN JOURNEY
LONG AFTERWARDS WHEN I HAD FALLEN INTO A LIGHT SLEEP I HEARD A KEY
TURN SOMEWHERE IN A LOCK BUT I COULD NOT TELL WHENCE THE SOUND CAME
WHAT IT ALL MEANS I CANNOT GUESS BUT THERE IS SOME SECRET BUSINESS
GOING ON IN THIS HOUSE OF GLOOM WHICH SOONER OR LATER WE SHALL GET TO
THE BOTTOM OF I DO NOT TROUBLE YOU WITH MY THEORIES FOR YOU ASKED
ME TO FURNISH YOU ONLY WITH FACTS I HAVE HAD A LONG TALK WITH SIR
HENRY THIS MORNING AND WE HAVE MADE A PLAN OF CAMPAIGN FOUNDED UPON
MY OBSERVATIONS OF LAST NIGHT I WILL NOT SPEAK ABOUT IT JUST NOW
BUT IT SHOULD MAKE MY NEXT REPORT INTERESTING READING
CHAPTER IX
SECOND REPORT OF DR WATSON
THE LIGHT UPON THE MOOR
BASKERVILLE HALL OCT TH
MY DEAR HOLMES
IF I WAS COMPELLED TO LEAVE YOU WITHOUT MUCH NEWS DURING THE EARLY
DAYS OF MY MISSION YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I AM MAKING UP FOR LOST
TIME AND THAT EVENTS ARE NOW CROWDING THICK AND FAST UPON US IN MY
LAST REPORT I ENDED UPON MY TOP NOTE WITH BARRYMORE AT THE WINDOW
AND NOW I HAVE QUITE A BUDGET ALREADY WHICH WILL UNLESS I AM MUCH
MISTAKEN CONSIDERABLY SURPRISE YOU THINGS HAVE TAKEN A TURN WHICH I
COULD NOT HAVE ANTICIPATED IN SOME WAYS THEY HAVE WITHIN THE LAST
FORTYEIGHT HOURS BECOME MUCH CLEARER AND IN SOME WAYS THEY HAVE
BECOME MORE COMPLICATED BUT I WILL TELL YOU ALL AND YOU SHALL JUDGE
FOR YOURSELF
BEFORE BREAKFAST ON THE MORNING FOLLOWING MY ADVENTURE I WENT DOWN
THE CORRIDOR AND EXAMINED THE ROOM IN WHICH BARRYMORE HAD BEEN ON THE
NIGHT BEFORE THE WESTERN WINDOW THROUGH WHICH HE HAD STARED SO
INTENTLY HAS I NOTICED ONE PECULIARITY ABOVE ALL OTHER WINDOWS IN
THE HOUSEIT COMMANDS THE NEAREST OUTLOOK ON THE MOOR THERE IS AN
OPENING BETWEEN TWO TREES WHICH ENABLES ONE FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW
TO LOOK RIGHT DOWN UPON IT WHILE FROM ALL THE OTHER WINDOWS IT IS
ONLY A DISTANT GLIMPSE WHICH CAN BE OBTAINED IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE
THAT BARRYMORE SINCE ONLY THIS WINDOW WOULD SERVE THE PURPOSE MUST
HAVE BEEN LOOKING OUT FOR SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY UPON THE MOOR THE
NIGHT WAS VERY DARK SO THAT I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE HOW HE COULD HAVE
HOPED TO SEE ANYONE IT HAD STRUCK ME THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT SOME
LOVE INTRIGUE WAS ON FOOT THAT WOULD HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR HIS STEALTHY
MOVEMENTS AND ALSO FOR THE UNEASINESS OF HIS WIFE THE MAN IS A
STRIKINGLOOKING FELLOW VERY WELL EQUIPPED TO STEAL THE HEART OF A
COUNTRY GIRL SO THAT THIS THEORY SEEMED TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SUPPORT
IT THAT OPENING OF THE DOOR WHICH I HAD HEARD AFTER I HAD RETURNED
TO MY ROOM MIGHT MEAN THAT HE HAD GONE OUT TO KEEP SOME CLANDESTINE
APPOINTMENT SO I REASONED WITH MYSELF IN THE MORNING AND I TELL YOU
THE DIRECTION OF MY SUSPICIONS HOWEVER MUCH THE RESULT MAY HAVE
SHOWN THAT THEY WERE UNFOUNDED
BUT WHATEVER THE TRUE EXPLANATION OF BARRYMORES MOVEMENTS MIGHT BE
I FELT THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KEEPING THEM TO MYSELF UNTIL I
COULD EXPLAIN THEM WAS MORE THAN I COULD BEAR I HAD AN INTERVIEW
WITH THE BARONET IN HIS STUDY AFTER BREAKFAST AND I TOLD HIM ALL
THAT I HAD SEEN HE WAS LESS SURPRISED THAN I HAD EXPECTED
I KNEW THAT BARRYMORE WALKED ABOUT NIGHTS AND I HAD A MIND TO SPEAK
TO HIM ABOUT IT SAID HE TWO OR THREE TIMES I HAVE HEARD HIS STEPS
IN THE PASSAGE COMING AND GOING JUST ABOUT THE HOUR YOU NAME
PERHAPS THEN HE PAYS A VISIT EVERY NIGHT TO THAT PARTICULAR WINDOW
I SUGGESTED
PERHAPS HE DOES IF SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHADOW HIM AND SEE
WHAT IT IS THAT HE IS AFTER I WONDER WHAT YOUR FRIEND HOLMES WOULD
DO IF HE WERE HERE
I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU NOW SUGGEST SAID I
HE WOULD FOLLOW BARRYMORE AND SEE WHAT HE DID
THEN WE SHALL DO IT TOGETHER
BUT SURELY HE WOULD HEAR US
THE MAN IS RATHER DEAF AND IN ANY CASE WE MUST TAKE OUR CHANCE OF
THAT WELL SIT UP IN MY ROOM TONIGHT AND WAIT UNTIL HE PASSES SIR
HENRY RUBBED HIS HANDS WITH PLEASURE AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE
HAILED THE ADVENTURE AS A RELIEF TO HIS SOMEWHAT QUIET LIFE UPON THE
MOOR
THE BARONET HAS BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE ARCHITECT WHO PREPARED
THE PLANS FOR SIR CHARLES AND WITH A CONTRACTOR FROM LONDON SO THAT
WE MAY EXPECT GREAT CHANGES TO BEGIN HERE SOON THERE HAVE BEEN
DECORATORS AND FURNISHERS UP FROM PLYMOUTH AND IT IS EVIDENT THAT
OUR FRIEND HAS LARGE IDEAS AND MEANS TO SPARE NO PAINS OR EXPENSE TO
RESTORE THE GRANDEUR OF HIS FAMILY WHEN THE HOUSE IS RENOVATED AND
REFURNISHED ALL THAT HE WILL NEED WILL BE A WIFE TO MAKE IT
COMPLETE BETWEEN OURSELVES THERE ARE PRETTY CLEAR SIGNS THAT THIS
WILL NOT BE WANTING IF THE LADY IS WILLING FOR I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A
MAN MORE INFATUATED WITH A WOMAN THAN HE IS WITH OUR BEAUTIFUL
NEIGHBOUR MISS STAPLETON AND YET THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE DOES NOT
RUN QUITE AS SMOOTHLY AS ONE WOULD UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXPECT
TODAY FOR EXAMPLE ITS SURFACE WAS BROKEN BY A VERY UNEXPECTED
RIPPLE WHICH HAS CAUSED OUR FRIEND CONSIDERABLE PERPLEXITY AND
ANNOYANCE
AFTER THE CONVERSATION WHICH I HAVE QUOTED ABOUT BARRYMORE SIR HENRY
PUT ON HIS HAT AND PREPARED TO GO OUT AS A MATTER OF COURSE I DID
THE SAME
WHAT ARE YOU COMING WATSON HE ASKED LOOKING AT ME IN A CURIOUS
WAY
THAT DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU ARE GOING ON THE MOOR SAID I
YES I AM
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT MY INSTRUCTIONS ARE I AM SORRY TO INTRUDE BUT
YOU HEARD HOW EARNESTLY HOLMES INSISTED THAT I SHOULD NOT LEAVE YOU
AND ESPECIALLY THAT YOU SHOULD NOT GO ALONE UPON THE MOOR
SIR HENRY PUT HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER WITH A PLEASANT SMILE
MY DEAR FELLOW SAID HE HOLMES WITH ALL HIS WISDOM DID NOT
FORESEE SOME THINGS WHICH HAVE HAPPENED SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON THE
MOOR YOU UNDERSTAND ME I AM SURE THAT YOU ARE THE LAST MAN IN THE
WORLD WHO WOULD WISH TO BE A SPOILSPORT I MUST GO OUT ALONE
IT PUT ME IN A MOST AWKWARD POSITION I WAS AT A LOSS WHAT TO SAY OR
WHAT TO DO AND BEFORE I HAD MADE UP MY MIND HE PICKED UP HIS CANE
AND WAS GONE
BUT WHEN I CAME TO THINK THE MATTER OVER MY CONSCIENCE REPROACHED ME
BITTERLY FOR HAVING ON ANY PRETEXT ALLOWED HIM TO GO OUT OF MY SIGHT
I IMAGINED WHAT MY FEELINGS WOULD BE IF I HAD TO RETURN TO YOU AND TO
CONFESS THAT SOME MISFORTUNE HAD OCCURRED THROUGH MY DISREGARD FOR
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS I ASSURE YOU MY CHEEKS FLUSHED AT THE VERY
THOUGHT IT MIGHT NOT EVEN NOW BE TOO LATE TO OVERTAKE HIM SO I SET
OFF AT ONCE IN THE DIRECTION OF MERRIPIT HOUSE
I HURRIED ALONG THE ROAD AT THE TOP OF MY SPEED WITHOUT SEEING
ANYTHING OF SIR HENRY UNTIL I CAME TO THE POINT WHERE THE MOOR PATH
BRANCHES OFF THERE FEARING THAT PERHAPS I HAD COME IN THE WRONG
DIRECTION AFTER ALL I MOUNTED A HILL FROM WHICH I COULD COMMAND A
VIEWTHE SAME HILL WHICH IS CUT INTO THE DARK QUARRY THENCE I SAW
HIM AT ONCE HE WAS ON THE MOOR PATH ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE OFF
AND A LADY WAS BY HIS SIDE WHO COULD ONLY BE MISS STAPLETON IT WAS
CLEAR THAT THERE WAS ALREADY AN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEM AND THAT
THEY HAD MET BY APPOINTMENT THEY WERE WALKING SLOWLY ALONG IN DEEP
CONVERSATION AND I SAW HER MAKING QUICK LITTLE MOVEMENTS OF HER
HANDS AS IF SHE WERE VERY EARNEST IN WHAT SHE WAS SAYING WHILE HE
LISTENED INTENTLY AND ONCE OR TWICE SHOOK HIS HEAD IN STRONG
DISSENT I STOOD AMONG THE ROCKS WATCHING THEM VERY MUCH PUZZLED AS
TO WHAT I SHOULD DO NEXT TO FOLLOW THEM AND BREAK INTO THEIR
INTIMATE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE AN OUTRAGE AND YET MY CLEAR DUTY
WAS NEVER FOR AN INSTANT TO LET HIM OUT OF MY SIGHT TO ACT THE SPY
UPON A FRIEND WAS A HATEFUL TASK STILL I COULD SEE NO BETTER COURSE
THAN TO OBSERVE HIM FROM THE HILL AND TO CLEAR MY CONSCIENCE BY
CONFESSING TO HIM AFTERWARDS WHAT I HAD DONE IT IS TRUE THAT IF ANY
SUDDEN DANGER HAD THREATENED HIM I WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO BE OF USE AND
YET I AM SURE THAT YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT THE POSITION WAS VERY
DIFFICULT AND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE WHICH I COULD DO
OUR FRIEND SIR HENRY AND THE LADY HAD HALTED ON THE PATH AND WERE
STANDING DEEPLY ABSORBED IN THEIR CONVERSATION WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY
AWARE THAT I WAS NOT THE ONLY WITNESS OF THEIR INTERVIEW A WISP OF
GREEN FLOATING IN THE AIR CAUGHT MY EYE AND ANOTHER GLANCE SHOWED ME
THAT IT WAS CARRIED ON A STICK BY A MAN WHO WAS MOVING AMONG THE
BROKEN GROUND IT WAS STAPLETON WITH HIS BUTTERFLYNET HE WAS VERY
MUCH CLOSER TO THE PAIR THAN I WAS AND HE APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN
THEIR DIRECTION AT THIS INSTANT SIR HENRY SUDDENLY DREW MISS
STAPLETON TO HIS SIDE HIS ARM WAS ROUND HER BUT IT SEEMED TO ME
THAT SHE WAS STRAINING AWAY FROM HIM WITH HER FACE AVERTED HE
STOOPED HIS HEAD TO HERS AND SHE RAISED ONE HAND AS IF IN PROTEST
NEXT MOMENT I SAW THEM SPRING APART AND TURN HURRIEDLY ROUND
STAPLETON WAS THE CAUSE OF THE INTERRUPTION HE WAS RUNNING WILDLY
TOWARDS THEM HIS ABSURD NET DANGLING BEHIND HIM HE GESTICULATED AND
ALMOST DANCED WITH EXCITEMENT IN FRONT OF THE LOVERS WHAT THE SCENE
MEANT I COULD NOT IMAGINE BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT STAPLETON WAS
ABUSING SIR HENRY WHO OFFERED EXPLANATIONS WHICH BECAME MORE ANGRY
AS THE OTHER REFUSED TO ACCEPT THEM THE LADY STOOD BY IN HAUGHTY
SILENCE FINALLY STAPLETON TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND BECKONED IN A
PEREMPTORY WAY TO HIS SISTER WHO AFTER AN IRRESOLUTE GLANCE AT SIR
HENRY WALKED OFF BY THE SIDE OF HER BROTHER THE NATURALISTS ANGRY
GESTURES SHOWED THAT THE LADY WAS INCLUDED IN HIS DISPLEASURE THE
BARONET STOOD FOR A MINUTE LOOKING AFTER THEM AND THEN HE WALKED
SLOWLY BACK THE WAY THAT HE HAD COME HIS HEAD HANGING THE VERY
PICTURE OF DEJECTION
WHAT ALL THIS MEANT I COULD NOT IMAGINE BUT I WAS DEEPLY ASHAMED TO
HAVE WITNESSED SO INTIMATE A SCENE WITHOUT MY FRIENDS KNOWLEDGE I
RAN DOWN THE HILL THEREFORE AND MET THE BARONET AT THE BOTTOM HIS
FACE WAS FLUSHED WITH ANGER AND HIS BROWS WERE WRINKLED LIKE ONE WHO
IS AT HIS WITS ENDS WHAT TO DO
HALLOA WATSON WHERE HAVE YOU DROPPED FROM SAID HE YOU DONT
MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU CAME AFTER ME IN SPITE OF ALL
I EXPLAINED EVERYTHING TO HIM HOW I HAD FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO
REMAIN BEHIND HOW I HAD FOLLOWED HIM AND HOW I HAD WITNESSED ALL
THAT HAD OCCURRED FOR AN INSTANT HIS EYES BLAZED AT ME BUT MY
FRANKNESS DISARMED HIS ANGER AND HE BROKE AT LAST INTO A RATHER
RUEFUL LAUGH
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE MIDDLE OF THAT PRAIRIE A FAIRLY SAFE
PLACE FOR A MAN TO BE PRIVATE SAID HE BUT BY THUNDER THE WHOLE
COUNTRYSIDE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN OUT TO SEE ME DO MY WOOINGAND A
MIGHTY POOR WOOING AT THAT WHERE HAD YOU ENGAGED A SEAT
I WAS ON THAT HILL
QUITE IN THE BACK ROW EH BUT HER BROTHER WAS WELL UP TO THE FRONT
DID YOU SEE HIM COME OUT ON US
YES I DID
DID HE EVER STRIKE YOU AS BEING CRAZYTHIS BROTHER OF HERS
I CANT SAY THAT HE EVER DID
I DARE SAY NOT I ALWAYS THOUGHT HIM SANE ENOUGH UNTIL TODAY BUT
YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM ME THAT EITHER HE OR I OUGHT TO BE IN A
STRAITJACKET WHATS THE MATTER WITH ME ANYHOW YOUVE LIVED NEAR
ME FOR SOME WEEKS WATSON TELL ME STRAIGHT NOW IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT WOULD PREVENT ME FROM MAKING A GOOD HUSBAND TO A WOMAN THAT I
LOVED
I SHOULD SAY NOT
HE CANT OBJECT TO MY WORLDLY POSITION SO IT MUST BE MYSELF THAT HE
HAS THIS DOWN ON WHAT HAS HE AGAINST ME I NEVER HURT MAN OR WOMAN
IN MY LIFE THAT I KNOW OF AND YET HE WOULD NOT SO MUCH AS LET ME
TOUCH THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS
DID HE SAY SO
THAT AND A DEAL MORE I TELL YOU WATSON IVE ONLY KNOWN HER THESE
FEW WEEKS BUT FROM THE FIRST I JUST FELT THAT SHE WAS MADE FOR ME
AND SHE TOOSHE WAS HAPPY WHEN SHE WAS WITH ME AND THAT ILL
SWEAR THERES A LIGHT IN A WOMANS EYES THAT SPEAKS LOUDER THAN
WORDS BUT HE HAS NEVER LET US GET TOGETHER AND IT WAS ONLY TODAY
FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT I SAW A CHANCE OF HAVING A FEW WORDS WITH HER
ALONE SHE WAS GLAD TO MEET ME BUT WHEN SHE DID IT WAS NOT LOVE THAT
SHE WOULD TALK ABOUT AND SHE WOULDNT HAVE LET ME TALK ABOUT IT
EITHER IF SHE COULD HAVE STOPPED IT SHE KEPT COMING BACK TO IT THAT
THIS WAS A PLACE OF DANGER AND THAT SHE WOULD NEVER BE HAPPY UNTIL I
HAD LEFT IT I TOLD HER THAT SINCE I HAD SEEN HER I WAS IN NO HURRY
TO LEAVE IT AND THAT IF SHE REALLY WANTED ME TO GO THE ONLY WAY TO
WORK IT WAS FOR HER TO ARRANGE TO GO WITH ME WITH THAT I OFFERED IN
AS MANY WORDS TO MARRY HER BUT BEFORE SHE COULD ANSWER DOWN CAME
THIS BROTHER OF HERS RUNNING AT US WITH A FACE ON HIM LIKE A MADMAN
HE WAS JUST WHITE WITH RAGE AND THOSE LIGHT EYES OF HIS WERE BLAZING
WITH FURY WHAT WAS I DOING WITH THE LADY HOW DARED I OFFER HER
ATTENTIONS WHICH WERE DISTASTEFUL TO HER DID I THINK THAT BECAUSE I
WAS A BARONET I COULD DO WHAT I LIKED IF HE HAD NOT BEEN HER BROTHER
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER HOW TO ANSWER HIM AS IT WAS I TOLD HIM
THAT MY FEELINGS TOWARDS HIS SISTER WERE SUCH AS I WAS NOT ASHAMED
OF AND THAT I HOPED THAT SHE MIGHT HONOUR ME BY BECOMING MY WIFE
THAT SEEMED TO MAKE THE MATTER NO BETTER SO THEN I LOST MY TEMPER
TOO AND I ANSWERED HIM RATHER MORE HOTLY THAN I SHOULD PERHAPS
CONSIDERING THAT SHE WAS STANDING BY SO IT ENDED BY HIS GOING OFF
WITH HER AS YOU SAW AND HERE AM I AS BADLY PUZZLED A MAN AS ANY IN
THIS COUNTY JUST TELL ME WHAT IT ALL MEANS WATSON AND ILL OWE YOU
MORE THAN EVER I CAN HOPE TO PAY
I TRIED ONE OR TWO EXPLANATIONS BUT INDEED I WAS COMPLETELY
PUZZLED MYSELF OUR FRIENDS TITLE HIS FORTUNE HIS AGE HIS
CHARACTER AND HIS APPEARANCE ARE ALL IN HIS FAVOUR AND I KNOW
NOTHING AGAINST HIM UNLESS IT BE THIS DARK FATE WHICH RUNS IN HIS
FAMILY THAT HIS ADVANCES SHOULD BE REJECTED SO BRUSQUELY WITHOUT ANY
REFERENCE TO THE LADYS OWN WISHES AND THAT THE LADY SHOULD ACCEPT
THE SITUATION WITHOUT PROTEST IS VERY AMAZING HOWEVER OUR
CONJECTURES WERE SET AT REST BY A VISIT FROM STAPLETON HIMSELF THAT
VERY AFTERNOON HE HAD COME TO OFFER APOLOGIES FOR HIS RUDENESS OF
THE MORNING AND AFTER A LONG PRIVATE INTERVIEW WITH SIR HENRY IN HIS
STUDY THE UPSHOT OF THEIR CONVERSATION WAS THAT THE BREACH IS QUITE
HEALED AND THAT WE ARE TO DINE AT MERRIPIT HOUSE NEXT FRIDAY AS A
SIGN OF IT
I DONT SAY NOW THAT HE ISNT A CRAZY MAN SAID SIR HENRY I CANT
FORGET THE LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN HE RAN AT ME THIS MORNING BUT I
MUST ALLOW THAT NO MAN COULD MAKE A MORE HANDSOME APOLOGY THAN HE HAS
DONE
DID HE GIVE ANY EXPLANATION OF HIS CONDUCT
HIS SISTER IS EVERYTHING IN HIS LIFE HE SAYS THAT IS NATURAL
ENOUGH AND I AM GLAD THAT HE SHOULD UNDERSTAND HER VALUE THEY HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN TOGETHER AND ACCORDING TO HIS ACCOUNT HE HAS BEEN A VERY
LONELY MAN WITH ONLY HER AS A COMPANION SO THAT THE THOUGHT OF
LOSING HER WAS REALLY TERRIBLE TO HIM HE HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD HE
SAID THAT I WAS BECOMING ATTACHED TO HER BUT WHEN HE SAW WITH HIS
OWN EYES THAT IT WAS REALLY SO AND THAT SHE MIGHT BE TAKEN AWAY FROM
HIM IT GAVE HIM SUCH A SHOCK THAT FOR A TIME HE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT HE SAID OR DID HE WAS VERY SORRY FOR ALL THAT HAD PASSED
AND HE RECOGNIZED HOW FOOLISH AND HOW SELFISH IT WAS THAT HE SHOULD
IMAGINE THAT HE COULD HOLD A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN LIKE HIS SISTER TO
HIMSELF FOR HER WHOLE LIFE IF SHE HAD TO LEAVE HIM HE HAD RATHER IT
WAS TO A NEIGHBOUR LIKE MYSELF THAN TO ANYONE ELSE BUT IN ANY CASE
IT WAS A BLOW TO HIM AND IT WOULD TAKE HIM SOME TIME BEFORE HE COULD
PREPARE HIMSELF TO MEET IT HE WOULD WITHDRAW ALL OPPOSITION UPON HIS
PART IF I WOULD PROMISE FOR THREE MONTHS TO LET THE MATTER REST AND
TO BE CONTENT WITH CULTIVATING THE LADYS FRIENDSHIP DURING THAT TIME
WITHOUT CLAIMING HER LOVE THIS I PROMISED AND SO THE MATTER RESTS
SO THERE IS ONE OF OUR SMALL MYSTERIES CLEARED UP IT IS SOMETHING TO
HAVE TOUCHED BOTTOM ANYWHERE IN THIS BOG IN WHICH WE ARE FLOUNDERING
WE KNOW NOW WHY STAPLETON LOOKED WITH DISFAVOUR UPON HIS SISTERS
SUITOREVEN WHEN THAT SUITOR WAS SO ELIGIBLE A ONE AS SIR HENRY AND
NOW I PASS ON TO ANOTHER THREAD WHICH I HAVE EXTRICATED OUT OF THE
TANGLED SKEIN THE MYSTERY OF THE SOBS IN THE NIGHT OF THE
TEARSTAINED FACE OF MRS BARRYMORE OF THE SECRET JOURNEY OF THE
BUTLER TO THE WESTERN LATTICE WINDOW CONGRATULATE ME MY DEAR
HOLMES AND TELL ME THAT I HAVE NOT DISAPPOINTED YOU AS AN
AGENTTHAT YOU DO NOT REGRET THE CONFIDENCE WHICH YOU SHOWED IN ME
WHEN YOU SENT ME DOWN ALL THESE THINGS HAVE BY ONE NIGHTS WORK BEEN
THOROUGHLY CLEARED
I HAVE SAID BY ONE NIGHTS WORK BUT IN TRUTH IT WAS BY TWO
NIGHTS WORK FOR ON THE FIRST WE DREW ENTIRELY BLANK I SAT UP WITH
SIR HENRY IN HIS ROOMS UNTIL NEARLY THREE OCLOCK IN THE MORNING BUT
NO SOUND OF ANY SORT DID WE HEAR EXCEPT THE CHIMING CLOCK UPON THE
STAIRS IT WAS A MOST MELANCHOLY VIGIL AND ENDED BY EACH OF US
FALLING ASLEEP IN OUR CHAIRS FORTUNATELY WE WERE NOT DISCOURAGED
AND WE DETERMINED TO TRY AGAIN THE NEXT NIGHT WE LOWERED THE LAMP
AND SAT SMOKING CIGARETTES WITHOUT MAKING THE LEAST SOUND IT WAS
INCREDIBLE HOW SLOWLY THE HOURS CRAWLED BY AND YET WE WERE HELPED
THROUGH IT BY THE SAME SORT OF PATIENT INTEREST WHICH THE HUNTER MUST
FEEL AS HE WATCHES THE TRAP INTO WHICH HE HOPES THE GAME MAY WANDER
ONE STRUCK AND TWO AND WE HAD ALMOST FOR THE SECOND TIME GIVEN IT
UP IN DESPAIR WHEN IN AN INSTANT WE BOTH SAT BOLT UPRIGHT IN OUR
CHAIRS WITH ALL OUR WEARY SENSES KEENLY ON THE ALERT ONCE MORE WE
HAD HEARD THE CREAK OF A STEP IN THE PASSAGE
VERY STEALTHILY WE HEARD IT PASS ALONG UNTIL IT DIED AWAY IN THE
DISTANCE THEN THE BARONET GENTLY OPENED HIS DOOR AND WE SET OUT IN
PURSUIT ALREADY OUR MAN HAD GONE ROUND THE GALLERY AND THE CORRIDOR
WAS ALL IN DARKNESS SOFTLY WE STOLE ALONG UNTIL WE HAD COME INTO THE
OTHER WING WE WERE JUST IN TIME TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE TALL
BLACKBEARDED FIGURE HIS SHOULDERS ROUNDED AS HE TIPTOED DOWN THE
PASSAGE THEN HE PASSED THROUGH THE SAME DOOR AS BEFORE AND THE
LIGHT OF THE CANDLE FRAMED IT IN THE DARKNESS AND SHOT ONE SINGLE
YELLOW BEAM ACROSS THE GLOOM OF THE CORRIDOR WE SHUFFLED CAUTIOUSLY
TOWARDS IT TRYING EVERY PLANK BEFORE WE DARED TO PUT OUR WHOLE
WEIGHT UPON IT WE HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION OF LEAVING OUR BOOTS
BEHIND US BUT EVEN SO THE OLD BOARDS SNAPPED AND CREAKED BENEATH
OUR TREAD SOMETIMES IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD FAIL TO HEAR
OUR APPROACH HOWEVER THE MAN IS FORTUNATELY RATHER DEAF AND HE WAS
ENTIRELY PREOCCUPIED IN THAT WHICH HE WAS DOING WHEN AT LAST WE
REACHED THE DOOR AND PEEPED THROUGH WE FOUND HIM CROUCHING AT THE
WINDOW CANDLE IN HAND HIS WHITE INTENT FACE PRESSED AGAINST THE
PANE EXACTLY AS I HAD SEEN HIM TWO NIGHTS BEFORE
WE HAD ARRANGED NO PLAN OF CAMPAIGN BUT THE BARONET IS A MAN TO WHOM
THE MOST DIRECT WAY IS ALWAYS THE MOST NATURAL HE WALKED INTO THE
ROOM AND AS HE DID SO BARRYMORE SPRANG UP FROM THE WINDOW WITH A
SHARP HISS OF HIS BREATH AND STOOD LIVID AND TREMBLING BEFORE US
HIS DARK EYES GLARING OUT OF THE WHITE MASK OF HIS FACE WERE FULL
OF HORROR AND ASTONISHMENT AS HE GAZED FROM SIR HENRY TO ME
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE BARRYMORE
NOTHING SIR HIS AGITATION WAS SO GREAT THAT HE COULD HARDLY
SPEAK AND THE SHADOWS SPRANG UP AND DOWN FROM THE SHAKING OF HIS
CANDLE IT WAS THE WINDOW SIR I GO ROUND AT NIGHT TO SEE THAT THEY
ARE FASTENED
ON THE SECOND FLOOR
YES SIR ALL THE WINDOWS
LOOK HERE BARRYMORE SAID SIR HENRY STERNLY WE HAVE MADE UP OUR
MINDS TO HAVE THE TRUTH OUT OF YOU SO IT WILL SAVE YOU TROUBLE TO
TELL IT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER COME NOW NO LIES WHAT WERE YOU
DOING AT THAT WINDOW
THE FELLOW LOOKED AT US IN A HELPLESS WAY AND HE WRUNG HIS HANDS
TOGETHER LIKE ONE WHO IS IN THE LAST EXTREMITY OF DOUBT AND MISERY
I WAS DOING NO HARM SIR I WAS HOLDING A CANDLE TO THE WINDOW
AND WHY WERE YOU HOLDING A CANDLE TO THE WINDOW
DONT ASK ME SIR HENRYDONT ASK ME I GIVE YOU MY WORD SIR THAT
IT IS NOT MY SECRET AND THAT I CANNOT TELL IT IF IT CONCERNED NO
ONE BUT MYSELF I WOULD NOT TRY TO KEEP IT FROM YOU
A SUDDEN IDEA OCCURRED TO ME AND I TOOK THE CANDLE FROM THE
TREMBLING HAND OF THE BUTLER
HE MUST HAVE BEEN HOLDING IT AS A SIGNAL SAID I LET US SEE IF
THERE IS ANY ANSWER I HELD IT AS HE HAD DONE AND STARED OUT INTO
THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT VAGUELY I COULD DISCERN THE BLACK BANK OF
THE TREES AND THE LIGHTER EXPANSE OF THE MOOR FOR THE MOON WAS
BEHIND THE CLOUDS AND THEN I GAVE A CRY OF EXULTATION FOR A TINY
PINPOINT OF YELLOW LIGHT HAD SUDDENLY TRANSFIXED THE DARK VEIL AND
GLOWED STEADILY IN THE CENTRE OF THE BLACK SQUARE FRAMED BY THE
WINDOW
THERE IT IS I CRIED
NO NO SIR IT IS NOTHINGNOTHING AT ALL THE BUTLER BROKE IN I
ASSURE YOU SIR
MOVE YOUR LIGHT ACROSS THE WINDOW WATSON CRIED THE BARONET SEE
THE OTHER MOVES ALSO NOW YOU RASCAL DO YOU DENY THAT IT IS A
SIGNAL COME SPEAK UP WHO IS YOUR CONFEDERATE OUT YONDER AND WHAT
IS THIS CONSPIRACY THAT IS GOING ON
THE MANS FACE BECAME OPENLY DEFIANT
IT IS MY BUSINESS AND NOT YOURS I WILL NOT TELL
THEN YOU LEAVE MY EMPLOYMENT RIGHT AWAY
VERY GOOD SIR IF I MUST I MUST
AND YOU GO IN DISGRACE BY THUNDER YOU MAY WELL BE ASHAMED OF
YOURSELF YOUR FAMILY HAS LIVED WITH MINE FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS
UNDER THIS ROOF AND HERE I FIND YOU DEEP IN SOME DARK PLOT AGAINST
ME
NO NO SIR NO NOT AGAINST YOU IT WAS A WOMANS VOICE AND MRS
BARRYMORE PALER AND MORE HORRORSTRUCK THAN HER HUSBAND WAS
STANDING AT THE DOOR HER BULKY FIGURE IN A SHAWL AND SKIRT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN COMIC WERE IT NOT FOR THE INTENSITY OF FEELING UPON HER
FACE
WE HAVE TO GO ELIZA THIS IS THE END OF IT YOU CAN PACK OUR
THINGS SAID THE BUTLER
OH JOHN JOHN HAVE I BROUGHT YOU TO THIS IT IS MY DOING SIR
HENRYALL MINE HE HAS DONE NOTHING EXCEPT FOR MY SAKE AND BECAUSE I
ASKED HIM
SPEAK OUT THEN WHAT DOES IT MEAN
MY UNHAPPY BROTHER IS STARVING ON THE MOOR WE CANNOT LET HIM PERISH
AT OUR VERY GATES THE LIGHT IS A SIGNAL TO HIM THAT FOOD IS READY
FOR HIM AND HIS LIGHT OUT YONDER IS TO SHOW THE SPOT TO WHICH TO
BRING IT
THEN YOUR BROTHER IS
THE ESCAPED CONVICT SIRSELDEN THE CRIMINAL
THATS THE TRUTH SIR SAID BARRYMORE I SAID THAT IT WAS NOT MY
SECRET AND THAT I COULD NOT TELL IT TO YOU BUT NOW YOU HAVE HEARD
IT AND YOU WILL SEE THAT IF THERE WAS A PLOT IT WAS NOT AGAINST
YOU
THIS THEN WAS THE EXPLANATION OF THE STEALTHY EXPEDITIONS AT NIGHT
AND THE LIGHT AT THE WINDOW SIR HENRY AND I BOTH STARED AT THE WOMAN
IN AMAZEMENT WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS STOLIDLY RESPECTABLE PERSON
WAS OF THE SAME BLOOD AS ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS CRIMINALS IN THE
COUNTRY
YES SIR MY NAME WAS SELDEN AND HE IS MY YOUNGER BROTHER WE
HUMOURED HIM TOO MUCH WHEN HE WAS A LAD AND GAVE HIM HIS OWN WAY IN
EVERYTHING UNTIL HE CAME TO THINK THAT THE WORLD WAS MADE FOR HIS
PLEASURE AND THAT HE COULD DO WHAT HE LIKED IN IT THEN AS HE GREW
OLDER HE MET WICKED COMPANIONS AND THE DEVIL ENTERED INTO HIM UNTIL
HE BROKE MY MOTHERS HEART AND DRAGGED OUR NAME IN THE DIRT FROM
CRIME TO CRIME HE SANK LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL IT IS ONLY THE MERCY OF
GOD WHICH HAS SNATCHED HIM FROM THE SCAFFOLD BUT TO ME SIR HE WAS
ALWAYS THE LITTLE CURLYHEADED BOY THAT I HAD NURSED AND PLAYED WITH
AS AN ELDER SISTER WOULD THAT WAS WHY HE BROKE PRISON SIR HE KNEW
THAT I WAS HERE AND THAT WE COULD NOT REFUSE TO HELP HIM WHEN HE
DRAGGED HIMSELF HERE ONE NIGHT WEARY AND STARVING WITH THE WARDERS
HARD AT HIS HEELS WHAT COULD WE DO WE TOOK HIM IN AND FED HIM AND
CARED FOR HIM THEN YOU RETURNED SIR AND MY BROTHER THOUGHT HE
WOULD BE SAFER ON THE MOOR THAN ANYWHERE ELSE UNTIL THE HUE AND CRY
WAS OVER SO HE LAY IN HIDING THERE BUT EVERY SECOND NIGHT WE MADE
SURE IF HE WAS STILL THERE BY PUTTING A LIGHT IN THE WINDOW AND IF
THERE WAS AN ANSWER MY HUSBAND TOOK OUT SOME BREAD AND MEAT TO HIM
EVERY DAY WE HOPED THAT HE WAS GONE BUT AS LONG AS HE WAS THERE WE
COULD NOT DESERT HIM THAT IS THE WHOLE TRUTH AS I AM AN HONEST
CHRISTIAN WOMAN AND YOU WILL SEE THAT IF THERE IS BLAME IN THE
MATTER IT DOES NOT LIE WITH MY HUSBAND BUT WITH ME FOR WHOSE SAKE
HE HAS DONE ALL THAT HE HAS
THE WOMANS WORDS CAME WITH AN INTENSE EARNESTNESS WHICH CARRIED
CONVICTION WITH THEM
IS THIS TRUE BARRYMORE
YES SIR HENRY EVERY WORD OF IT
WELL I CANNOT BLAME YOU FOR STANDING BY YOUR OWN WIFE FORGET WHAT
I HAVE SAID GO TO YOUR ROOM YOU TWO AND WE SHALL TALK FURTHER
ABOUT THIS MATTER IN THE MORNING
WHEN THEY WERE GONE WE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AGAIN SIR HENRY HAD
FLUNG IT OPEN AND THE COLD NIGHT WIND BEAT IN UPON OUR FACES FAR
AWAY IN THE BLACK DISTANCE THERE STILL GLOWED THAT ONE TINY POINT OF
YELLOW LIGHT
I WONDER HE DARES SAID SIR HENRY
IT MAY BE SO PLACED AS TO BE ONLY VISIBLE FROM HERE
VERY LIKELY HOW FAR DO YOU THINK IT IS
OUT BY THE CLEFT TOR I THINK
NOT MORE THAN A MILE OR TWO OFF
HARDLY THAT
WELL IT CANNOT BE FAR IF BARRYMORE HAD TO CARRY OUT THE FOOD TO IT
AND HE IS WAITING THIS VILLAIN BESIDE THAT CANDLE BY THUNDER
WATSON I AM GOING OUT TO TAKE THAT MAN
THE SAME THOUGHT HAD CROSSED MY OWN MIND IT WAS NOT AS IF THE
BARRYMORES HAD TAKEN US INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE THEIR SECRET HAD BEEN
FORCED FROM THEM THE MAN WAS A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY AN
UNMITIGATED SCOUNDREL FOR WHOM THERE WAS NEITHER PITY NOR EXCUSE WE
WERE ONLY DOING OUR DUTY IN TAKING THIS CHANCE OF PUTTING HIM BACK
WHERE HE COULD DO NO HARM WITH HIS BRUTAL AND VIOLENT NATURE OTHERS
WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE IF WE HELD OUR HANDS ANY NIGHT FOR
EXAMPLE OUR NEIGHBOURS THE STAPLETONS MIGHT BE ATTACKED BY HIM AND
IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE THOUGHT OF THIS WHICH MADE SIR HENRY SO KEEN
UPON THE ADVENTURE
I WILL COME SAID I
THEN GET YOUR REVOLVER AND PUT ON YOUR BOOTS THE SOONER WE START
THE BETTER AS THE FELLOW MAY PUT OUT HIS LIGHT AND BE OFF
IN FIVE MINUTES WE WERE OUTSIDE THE DOOR STARTING UPON OUR
EXPEDITION WE HURRIED THROUGH THE DARK SHRUBBERY AMID THE DULL
MOANING OF THE AUTUMN WIND AND THE RUSTLE OF THE FALLING LEAVES THE
NIGHT AIR WAS HEAVY WITH THE SMELL OF DAMP AND DECAY NOW AND AGAIN
THE MOON PEEPED OUT FOR AN INSTANT BUT CLOUDS WERE DRIVING OVER THE
FACE OF THE SKY AND JUST AS WE CAME OUT ON THE MOOR A THIN RAIN
BEGAN TO FALL THE LIGHT STILL BURNED STEADILY IN FRONT
ARE YOU ARMED I ASKED
I HAVE A HUNTINGCROP
WE MUST CLOSE IN ON HIM RAPIDLY FOR HE IS SAID TO BE A DESPERATE
FELLOW WE SHALL TAKE HIM BY SURPRISE AND HAVE HIM AT OUR MERCY
BEFORE HE CAN RESIST
I SAY WATSON SAID THE BARONET WHAT WOULD HOLMES SAY TO THIS
HOW ABOUT THAT HOUR OF DARKNESS IN WHICH THE POWER OF EVIL IS
EXALTED
AS IF IN ANSWER TO HIS WORDS THERE ROSE SUDDENLY OUT OF THE VAST
GLOOM OF THE MOOR THAT STRANGE CRY WHICH I HAD ALREADY HEARD UPON THE
BORDERS OF THE GREAT GRIMPEN MIRE IT CAME WITH THE WIND THROUGH THE
SILENCE OF THE NIGHT A LONG DEEP MUTTER THEN A RISING HOWL AND
THEN THE SAD MOAN IN WHICH IT DIED AWAY AGAIN AND AGAIN IT SOUNDED
THE WHOLE AIR THROBBING WITH IT STRIDENT WILD AND MENACING THE
BARONET CAUGHT MY SLEEVE AND HIS FACE GLIMMERED WHITE THROUGH THE
DARKNESS
MY GOD WHATS THAT WATSON
I DONT KNOW ITS A SOUND THEY HAVE ON THE MOOR I HEARD IT ONCE
BEFORE
IT DIED AWAY AND AN ABSOLUTE SILENCE CLOSED IN UPON US WE STOOD
STRAINING OUR EARS BUT NOTHING CAME
WATSON SAID THE BARONET IT WAS THE CRY OF A HOUND
MY BLOOD RAN COLD IN MY VEINS FOR THERE WAS A BREAK IN HIS VOICE
WHICH TOLD OF THE SUDDEN HORROR WHICH HAD SEIZED HIM
WHAT DO THEY CALL THIS SOUND HE ASKED
WHO
THE FOLK ON THE COUNTRYSIDE
OH THEY ARE IGNORANT PEOPLE WHY SHOULD YOU MIND WHAT THEY CALL
IT
TELL ME WATSON WHAT DO THEY SAY OF IT
I HESITATED BUT COULD NOT ESCAPE THE QUESTION
THEY SAY IT IS THE CRY OF THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES
HE GROANED AND WAS SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS
A HOUND IT WAS HE SAID AT LAST BUT IT SEEMED TO COME FROM MILES
AWAY OVER YONDER I THINK
IT WAS HARD TO SAY WHENCE IT CAME
IT ROSE AND FELL WITH THE WIND ISNT THAT THE DIRECTION OF THE
GREAT GRIMPEN MIRE
YES IT IS
WELL IT WAS UP THERE COME NOW WATSON DIDNT YOU THINK YOURSELF
THAT IT WAS THE CRY OF A HOUND I AM NOT A CHILD YOU NEED NOT FEAR
TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
STAPLETON WAS WITH ME WHEN I HEARD IT LAST HE SAID THAT IT MIGHT BE
THE CALLING OF A STRANGE BIRD
NO NO IT WAS A HOUND MY GOD CAN THERE BE SOME TRUTH IN ALL THESE
STORIES IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I AM REALLY IN DANGER FROM SO DARK A
CAUSE YOU DONT BELIEVE IT DO YOU WATSON
NO NO
AND YET IT WAS ONE THING TO LAUGH ABOUT IT IN LONDON AND IT IS
ANOTHER TO STAND OUT HERE IN THE DARKNESS OF THE MOOR AND TO HEAR
SUCH A CRY AS THAT AND MY UNCLE THERE WAS THE FOOTPRINT OF THE
HOUND BESIDE HIM AS HE LAY IT ALL FITS TOGETHER I DONT THINK THAT
I AM A COWARD WATSON BUT THAT SOUND SEEMED TO FREEZE MY VERY BLOOD
FEEL MY HAND
IT WAS AS COLD AS A BLOCK OF MARBLE
YOULL BE ALL RIGHT TOMORROW
I DONT THINK ILL GET THAT CRY OUT OF MY HEAD WHAT DO YOU ADVISE
THAT WE DO NOW
SHALL WE TURN BACK
NO BY THUNDER WE HAVE COME OUT TO GET OUR MAN AND WE WILL DO IT
WE AFTER THE CONVICT AND A HELLHOUND AS LIKELY AS NOT AFTER US
COME ON WELL SEE IT THROUGH IF ALL THE FIENDS OF THE PIT WERE LOOSE
UPON THE MOOR
WE STUMBLED SLOWLY ALONG IN THE DARKNESS WITH THE BLACK LOOM OF THE
CRAGGY HILLS AROUND US AND THE YELLOW SPECK OF LIGHT BURNING
STEADILY IN FRONT THERE IS NOTHING SO DECEPTIVE AS THE DISTANCE OF A
LIGHT UPON A PITCHDARK NIGHT AND SOMETIMES THE GLIMMER SEEMED TO BE
FAR AWAY UPON THE HORIZON AND SOMETIMES IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WITHIN A
FEW YARDS OF US BUT AT LAST WE COULD SEE WHENCE IT CAME AND THEN WE
KNEW THAT WE WERE INDEED VERY CLOSE A GUTTERING CANDLE WAS STUCK IN
A CREVICE OF THE ROCKS WHICH FLANKED IT ON EACH SIDE SO AS TO KEEP
THE WIND FROM IT AND ALSO TO PREVENT IT FROM BEING VISIBLE SAVE IN
THE DIRECTION OF BASKERVILLE HALL A BOULDER OF GRANITE CONCEALED OUR
APPROACH AND CROUCHING BEHIND IT WE GAZED OVER IT AT THE SIGNAL
LIGHT IT WAS STRANGE TO SEE THIS SINGLE CANDLE BURNING THERE IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE MOOR WITH NO SIGN OF LIFE NEAR ITJUST THE ONE
STRAIGHT YELLOW FLAME AND THE GLEAM OF THE ROCK ON EACH SIDE OF IT
WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW WHISPERED SIR HENRY
WAIT HERE HE MUST BE NEAR HIS LIGHT LET US SEE IF WE CAN GET A
GLIMPSE OF HIM
THE WORDS WERE HARDLY OUT OF MY MOUTH WHEN WE BOTH SAW HIM OVER THE
ROCKS IN THE CREVICE OF WHICH THE CANDLE BURNED THERE WAS THRUST
OUT AN EVIL YELLOW FACE A TERRIBLE ANIMAL FACE ALL SEAMED AND
SCORED WITH VILE PASSIONS FOUL WITH MIRE WITH A BRISTLING BEARD
AND HUNG WITH MATTED HAIR IT MIGHT WELL HAVE BELONGED TO ONE OF
THOSE OLD SAVAGES WHO DWELT IN THE BURROWS ON THE HILLSIDES THE
LIGHT BENEATH HIM WAS REFLECTED IN HIS SMALL CUNNING EYES WHICH
PEERED FIERCELY TO RIGHT AND LEFT THROUGH THE DARKNESS LIKE A CRAFTY
AND SAVAGE ANIMAL WHO HAS HEARD THE STEPS OF THE HUNTERS
SOMETHING HAD EVIDENTLY AROUSED HIS SUSPICIONS IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT
BARRYMORE HAD SOME PRIVATE SIGNAL WHICH WE HAD NEGLECTED TO GIVE OR
THE FELLOW MAY HAVE HAD SOME OTHER REASON FOR THINKING THAT ALL WAS
NOT WELL BUT I COULD READ HIS FEARS UPON HIS WICKED FACE ANY
INSTANT HE MIGHT DASH OUT THE LIGHT AND VANISH IN THE DARKNESS I
SPRANG FORWARD THEREFORE AND SIR HENRY DID THE SAME AT THE SAME
MOMENT THE CONVICT SCREAMED OUT A CURSE AT US AND HURLED A ROCK WHICH
SPLINTERED UP AGAINST THE BOULDER WHICH HAD SHELTERED US I CAUGHT
ONE GLIMPSE OF HIS SHORT SQUAT STRONGLYBUILT FIGURE AS HE SPRANG
TO HIS FEET AND TURNED TO RUN AT THE SAME MOMENT BY A LUCKY CHANCE
THE MOON BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS WE RUSHED OVER THE BROW OF THE
HILL AND THERE WAS OUR MAN RUNNING WITH GREAT SPEED DOWN THE OTHER
SIDE SPRINGING OVER THE STONES IN HIS WAY WITH THE ACTIVITY OF A
MOUNTAIN GOAT A LUCKY LONG SHOT OF MY REVOLVER MIGHT HAVE CRIPPLED
HIM BUT I HAD BROUGHT IT ONLY TO DEFEND MYSELF IF ATTACKED AND NOT
TO SHOOT AN UNARMED MAN WHO WAS RUNNING AWAY
WE WERE BOTH SWIFT RUNNERS AND IN FAIRLY GOOD TRAINING BUT WE SOON
FOUND THAT WE HAD NO CHANCE OF OVERTAKING HIM WE SAW HIM FOR A LONG
TIME IN THE MOONLIGHT UNTIL HE WAS ONLY A SMALL SPECK MOVING SWIFTLY
AMONG THE BOULDERS UPON THE SIDE OF A DISTANT HILL WE RAN AND RAN
UNTIL WE WERE COMPLETELY BLOWN BUT THE SPACE BETWEEN US GREW EVER
WIDER FINALLY WE STOPPED AND SAT PANTING ON TWO ROCKS WHILE WE
WATCHED HIM DISAPPEARING IN THE DISTANCE
AND IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT THERE OCCURRED A MOST STRANGE AND
UNEXPECTED THING WE HAD RISEN FROM OUR ROCKS AND WERE TURNING TO GO
HOME HAVING ABANDONED THE HOPELESS CHASE THE MOON WAS LOW UPON THE
RIGHT AND THE JAGGED PINNACLE OF A GRANITE TOR STOOD UP AGAINST THE
LOWER CURVE OF ITS SILVER DISC THERE OUTLINED AS BLACK AS AN EBONY
STATUE ON THAT SHINING BACKGROUND I SAW THE FIGURE OF A MAN UPON
THE TOR DO NOT THINK THAT IT WAS A DELUSION HOLMES I ASSURE YOU
THAT I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE SEEN ANYTHING MORE CLEARLY AS FAR AS I
COULD JUDGE THE FIGURE WAS THAT OF A TALL THIN MAN HE STOOD WITH
HIS LEGS A LITTLE SEPARATED HIS ARMS FOLDED HIS HEAD BOWED AS IF
HE WERE BROODING OVER THAT ENORMOUS WILDERNESS OF PEAT AND GRANITE
WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE VERY SPIRIT OF THAT
TERRIBLE PLACE IT WAS NOT THE CONVICT THIS MAN WAS FAR FROM THE
PLACE WHERE THE LATTER HAD DISAPPEARED BESIDES HE WAS A MUCH TALLER
MAN WITH A CRY OF SURPRISE I POINTED HIM OUT TO THE BARONET BUT IN
THE INSTANT DURING WHICH I HAD TURNED TO GRASP HIS ARM THE MAN WAS
GONE THERE WAS THE SHARP PINNACLE OF GRANITE STILL CUTTING THE LOWER
EDGE OF THE MOON BUT ITS PEAK BORE NO TRACE OF THAT SILENT AND
MOTIONLESS FIGURE
I WISHED TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION AND TO SEARCH THE TOR BUT IT WAS
SOME DISTANCE AWAY THE BARONETS NERVES WERE STILL QUIVERING FROM
THAT CRY WHICH RECALLED THE DARK STORY OF HIS FAMILY AND HE WAS NOT
IN THE MOOD FOR FRESH ADVENTURES HE HAD NOT SEEN THIS LONELY MAN
UPON THE TOR AND COULD NOT FEEL THE THRILL WHICH HIS STRANGE PRESENCE
AND HIS COMMANDING ATTITUDE HAD GIVEN TO ME A WARDER NO DOUBT
SAID HE THE MOOR HAS BEEN THICK WITH THEM SINCE THIS FELLOW
ESCAPED WELL PERHAPS HIS EXPLANATION MAY BE THE RIGHT ONE BUT I
SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME FURTHER PROOF OF IT TODAY WE MEAN TO
COMMUNICATE TO THE PRINCETOWN PEOPLE WHERE THEY SHOULD LOOK FOR THEIR
MISSING MAN BUT IT IS HARD LINES THAT WE HAVE NOT ACTUALLY HAD THE
TRIUMPH OF BRINGING HIM BACK AS OUR OWN PRISONER SUCH ARE THE
ADVENTURES OF LAST NIGHT AND YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE MY DEAR HOLMES
THAT I HAVE DONE YOU VERY WELL IN THE MATTER OF A REPORT MUCH OF
WHAT I TELL YOU IS NO DOUBT QUITE IRRELEVANT BUT STILL I FEEL THAT
IT IS BEST THAT I SHOULD LET YOU HAVE ALL THE FACTS AND LEAVE YOU TO
SELECT FOR YOURSELF THOSE WHICH WILL BE OF MOST SERVICE TO YOU IN
HELPING YOU TO YOUR CONCLUSIONS WE ARE CERTAINLY MAKING SOME
PROGRESS SO FAR AS THE BARRYMORES GO WE HAVE FOUND THE MOTIVE OF
THEIR ACTIONS AND THAT HAS CLEARED UP THE SITUATION VERY MUCH BUT
THE MOOR WITH ITS MYSTERIES AND ITS STRANGE INHABITANTS REMAINS AS
INSCRUTABLE AS EVER PERHAPS IN MY NEXT I MAY BE ABLE TO THROW SOME
LIGHT UPON THIS ALSO BEST OF ALL WOULD IT BE IF YOU COULD COME DOWN
TO US IN ANY CASE YOU WILL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN IN THE COURSE OF THE
NEXT FEW DAYS
CHAPTER X
EXTRACT FROM THE DIARY OF DR WATSON
SO FAR I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO QUOTE FROM THE REPORTS WHICH I HAVE
FORWARDED DURING THESE EARLY DAYS TO SHERLOCK HOLMES NOW HOWEVER I
HAVE ARRIVED AT A POINT IN MY NARRATIVE WHERE I AM COMPELLED TO
ABANDON THIS METHOD AND TO TRUST ONCE MORE TO MY RECOLLECTIONS AIDED
BY THE DIARY WHICH I KEPT AT THE TIME A FEW EXTRACTS FROM THE LATTER
WILL CARRY ME ON TO THOSE SCENES WHICH ARE INDELIBLY FIXED IN EVERY
DETAIL UPON MY MEMORY I PROCEED THEN FROM THE MORNING WHICH
FOLLOWED OUR ABORTIVE CHASE OF THE CONVICT AND OUR OTHER STRANGE
EXPERIENCES UPON THE MOOR
OCTOBER THA DULL AND FOGGY DAY WITH A DRIZZLE OF RAIN THE HOUSE
IS BANKED IN WITH ROLLING CLOUDS WHICH RISE NOW AND THEN TO SHOW THE
DREARY CURVES OF THE MOOR WITH THIN SILVER VEINS UPON THE SIDES OF
THE HILLS AND THE DISTANT BOULDERS GLEAMING WHERE THE LIGHT STRIKES
UPON THEIR WET FACES IT IS MELANCHOLY OUTSIDE AND IN THE BARONET IS
IN A BLACK REACTION AFTER THE EXCITEMENTS OF THE NIGHT I AM
CONSCIOUS MYSELF OF A WEIGHT AT MY HEART AND A FEELING OF IMPENDING
DANGEREVER PRESENT DANGER WHICH IS THE MORE TERRIBLE BECAUSE I AM
UNABLE TO DEFINE IT
AND HAVE I NOT CAUSE FOR SUCH A FEELING CONSIDER THE LONG SEQUENCE
OF INCIDENTS WHICH HAVE ALL POINTED TO SOME SINISTER INFLUENCE WHICH
IS AT WORK AROUND US THERE IS THE DEATH OF THE LAST OCCUPANT OF THE
HALL FULFILLING SO EXACTLY THE CONDITIONS OF THE FAMILY LEGEND AND
THERE ARE THE REPEATED REPORTS FROM PEASANTS OF THE APPEARANCE OF A
STRANGE CREATURE UPON THE MOOR TWICE I HAVE WITH MY OWN EARS HEARD
THE SOUND WHICH RESEMBLED THE DISTANT BAYING OF A HOUND IT IS
INCREDIBLE IMPOSSIBLE THAT IT SHOULD REALLY BE OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY
LAWS OF NATURE A SPECTRAL HOUND WHICH LEAVES MATERIAL FOOTMARKS AND
FILLS THE AIR WITH ITS HOWLING IS SURELY NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF
STAPLETON MAY FALL IN WITH SUCH A SUPERSTITION AND MORTIMER ALSO
BUT IF I HAVE ONE QUALITY UPON EARTH IT IS COMMONSENSE AND NOTHING
WILL PERSUADE ME TO BELIEVE IN SUCH A THING TO DO SO WOULD BE TO
DESCEND TO THE LEVEL OF THESE POOR PEASANTS WHO ARE NOT CONTENT WITH
A MERE FIEND DOG BUT MUST NEEDS DESCRIBE HIM WITH HELLFIRE SHOOTING
FROM HIS MOUTH AND EYES HOLMES WOULD NOT LISTEN TO SUCH FANCIES AND
I AM HIS AGENT BUT FACTS ARE FACTS AND I HAVE TWICE HEARD THIS
CRYING UPON THE MOOR SUPPOSE THAT THERE WERE REALLY SOME HUGE HOUND
LOOSE UPON IT THAT WOULD GO FAR TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING BUT WHERE
COULD SUCH A HOUND LIE CONCEALED WHERE DID IT GET ITS FOOD WHERE
DID IT COME FROM HOW WAS IT THAT NO ONE SAW IT BY DAY IT MUST BE
CONFESSED THAT THE NATURAL EXPLANATION OFFERS ALMOST AS MANY
DIFFICULTIES AS THE OTHER AND ALWAYS APART FROM THE HOUND THERE IS
THE FACT OF THE HUMAN AGENCY IN LONDON THE MAN IN THE CAB AND THE
LETTER WHICH WARNED SIR HENRY AGAINST THE MOOR THIS AT LEAST WAS
REAL BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE WORK OF A PROTECTING FRIEND AS
EASILY AS OF AN ENEMY WHERE IS THAT FRIEND OR ENEMY NOW HAS HE
REMAINED IN LONDON OR HAS HE FOLLOWED US DOWN HERE COULD HECOULD
HE BE THE STRANGER WHOM I SAW UPON THE TOR
IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE HAD ONLY THE ONE GLANCE AT HIM AND YET THERE
ARE SOME THINGS TO WHICH I AM READY TO SWEAR HE IS NO ONE WHOM I
HAVE SEEN DOWN HERE AND I HAVE NOW MET ALL THE NEIGHBOURS THE
FIGURE WAS FAR TALLER THAN THAT OF STAPLETON FAR THINNER THAN THAT
OF FRANKLAND BARRYMORE IT MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN BUT WE HAD LEFT
HIM BEHIND US AND I AM CERTAIN THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE FOLLOWED US A
STRANGER THEN IS STILL DOGGING US JUST AS A STRANGER DOGGED US IN
LONDON WE HAVE NEVER SHAKEN HIM OFF IF I COULD LAY MY HANDS UPON
THAT MAN THEN AT LAST WE MIGHT FIND OURSELVES AT THE END OF ALL OUR
DIFFICULTIES TO THIS ONE PURPOSE I MUST NOW DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES
MY FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO TELL SIR HENRY ALL MY PLANS MY SECOND AND
WISEST ONE IS TO PLAY MY OWN GAME AND SPEAK AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE TO
ANYONE HE IS SILENT AND DISTRAIT HIS NERVES HAVE BEEN STRANGELY
SHAKEN BY THAT SOUND UPON THE MOOR I WILL SAY NOTHING TO ADD TO HIS
ANXIETIES BUT I WILL TAKE MY OWN STEPS TO ATTAIN MY OWN END
WE HAD A SMALL SCENE THIS MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST BARRYMORE ASKED
LEAVE TO SPEAK WITH SIR HENRY AND THEY WERE CLOSETED IN HIS STUDY
SOME LITTLE TIME SITTING IN THE BILLIARDROOM I MORE THAN ONCE HEARD
THE SOUND OF VOICES RAISED AND I HAD A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHAT THE
POINT WAS WHICH WAS UNDER DISCUSSION AFTER A TIME THE BARONET OPENED
HIS DOOR AND CALLED FOR ME
BARRYMORE CONSIDERS THAT HE HAS A GRIEVANCE HE SAID HE THINKS
THAT IT WAS UNFAIR ON OUR PART TO HUNT HIS BROTHERINLAW DOWN WHEN
HE OF HIS OWN FREE WILL HAD TOLD US THE SECRET
THE BUTLER WAS STANDING VERY PALE BUT VERY COLLECTED BEFORE US
I MAY HAVE SPOKEN TOO WARMLY SIR SAID HE AND IF I HAVE I AM
SURE THAT I BEG YOUR PARDON AT THE SAME TIME I WAS VERY MUCH
SURPRISED WHEN I HEARD YOU TWO GENTLEMEN COME BACK THIS MORNING AND
LEARNED THAT YOU HAD BEEN CHASING SELDEN THE POOR FELLOW HAS ENOUGH
TO FIGHT AGAINST WITHOUT MY PUTTING MORE UPON HIS TRACK
IF YOU HAD TOLD US OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
DIFFERENT THING SAID THE BARONET YOU ONLY TOLD US OR RATHER YOUR
WIFE ONLY TOLD US WHEN IT WAS FORCED FROM YOU AND YOU COULD NOT HELP
YOURSELF
I DIDNT THINK YOU WOULD HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IT SIR
HENRYINDEED I DIDNT
THE MAN IS A PUBLIC DANGER THERE ARE LONELY HOUSES SCATTERED OVER
THE MOOR AND HE IS A FELLOW WHO WOULD STICK AT NOTHING YOU ONLY
WANT TO GET A GLIMPSE OF HIS FACE TO SEE THAT LOOK AT MR
STAPLETONS HOUSE FOR EXAMPLE WITH NO ONE BUT HIMSELF TO DEFEND IT
THERES NO SAFETY FOR ANYONE UNTIL HE IS UNDER LOCK AND KEY
HELL BREAK INTO NO HOUSE SIR I GIVE YOU MY SOLEMN WORD UPON THAT
BUT HE WILL NEVER TROUBLE ANYONE IN THIS COUNTRY AGAIN I ASSURE YOU
SIR HENRY THAT IN A VERY FEW DAYS THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS WILL
HAVE BEEN MADE AND HE WILL BE ON HIS WAY TO SOUTH AMERICA FOR GODS
SAKE SIR I BEG OF YOU NOT TO LET THE POLICE KNOW THAT HE IS STILL
ON THE MOOR THEY HAVE GIVEN UP THE CHASE THERE AND HE CAN LIE QUIET
UNTIL THE SHIP IS READY FOR HIM YOU CANT TELL ON HIM WITHOUT
GETTING MY WIFE AND ME INTO TROUBLE I BEG YOU SIR TO SAY NOTHING
TO THE POLICE
WHAT DO YOU SAY WATSON
I SHRUGGED MY SHOULDERS IF HE WERE SAFELY OUT OF THE COUNTRY IT
WOULD RELIEVE THE TAXPAYER OF A BURDEN
BUT HOW ABOUT THE CHANCE OF HIS HOLDING SOMEONE UP BEFORE HE GOES
HE WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING SO MAD SIR WE HAVE PROVIDED HIM WITH ALL
THAT HE CAN WANT TO COMMIT A CRIME WOULD BE TO SHOW WHERE HE WAS
HIDING
THAT IS TRUE SAID SIR HENRY WELL BARRYMORE
GOD BLESS YOU SIR AND THANK YOU FROM MY HEART IT WOULD HAVE
KILLED MY POOR WIFE HAD HE BEEN TAKEN AGAIN
I GUESS WE ARE AIDING AND ABETTING A FELONY WATSON BUT AFTER WHAT
WE HAVE HEARD I DONT FEEL AS IF I COULD GIVE THE MAN UP SO THERE IS
AN END OF IT ALL RIGHT BARRYMORE YOU CAN GO
WITH A FEW BROKEN WORDS OF GRATITUDE THE MAN TURNED BUT HE HESITATED
AND THEN CAME BACK
YOUVE BEEN SO KIND TO US SIR THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO DO THE BEST I
CAN FOR YOU IN RETURN I KNOW SOMETHING SIR HENRY AND PERHAPS I
SHOULD HAVE SAID IT BEFORE BUT IT WAS LONG AFTER THE INQUEST THAT I
FOUND IT OUT IVE NEVER BREATHED A WORD ABOUT IT YET TO MORTAL MAN
ITS ABOUT POOR SIR CHARLESS DEATH
THE BARONET AND I WERE BOTH UPON OUR FEET DO YOU KNOW HOW HE DIED
NO SIR I DONT KNOW THAT
WHAT THEN
I KNOW WHY HE WAS AT THE GATE AT THAT HOUR IT WAS TO MEET A WOMAN
TO MEET A WOMAN HE
YES SIR
AND THE WOMANS NAME
I CANT GIVE YOU THE NAME SIR BUT I CAN GIVE YOU THE INITIALS HER
INITIALS WERE L L
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS BARRYMORE
WELL SIR HENRY YOUR UNCLE HAD A LETTER THAT MORNING HE HAD
USUALLY A GREAT MANY LETTERS FOR HE WAS A PUBLIC MAN AND WELL KNOWN
FOR HIS KIND HEART SO THAT EVERYONE WHO WAS IN TROUBLE WAS GLAD TO
TURN TO HIM BUT THAT MORNING AS IT CHANCED THERE WAS ONLY THIS ONE
LETTER SO I TOOK THE MORE NOTICE OF IT IT WAS FROM COOMBE TRACEY
AND IT WAS ADDRESSED IN A WOMANS HAND
WELL
WELL SIR I THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER AND NEVER WOULD HAVE
DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR MY WIFE ONLY A FEW WEEKS AGO SHE WAS
CLEANING OUT SIR CHARLESS STUDYIT HAD NEVER BEEN TOUCHED SINCE HIS
DEATHAND SHE FOUND THE ASHES OF A BURNED LETTER IN THE BACK OF THE
GRATE THE GREATER PART OF IT WAS CHARRED TO PIECES BUT ONE LITTLE
SLIP THE END OF A PAGE HUNG TOGETHER AND THE WRITING COULD STILL
BE READ THOUGH IT WAS GRAY ON A BLACK GROUND IT SEEMED TO US TO BE
A POSTSCRIPT AT THE END OF THE LETTER AND IT SAID PLEASE PLEASE
AS YOU ARE A GENTLEMAN BURN THIS LETTER AND BE AT THE GATE BY TEN
OCLOCK BENEATH IT WERE SIGNED THE INITIALS L L
HAVE YOU GOT THAT SLIP
NO SIR IT CRUMBLED ALL TO BITS AFTER WE MOVED IT
HAD SIR CHARLES RECEIVED ANY OTHER LETTERS IN THE SAME WRITING
WELL SIR I TOOK NO PARTICULAR NOTICE OF HIS LETTERS I SHOULD NOT
HAVE NOTICED THIS ONE ONLY IT HAPPENED TO COME ALONE
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO L L IS
NO SIR NO MORE THAN YOU HAVE BUT I EXPECT IF WE COULD LAY OUR
HANDS UPON THAT LADY WE SHOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT SIR CHARLESS DEATH
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND BARRYMORE HOW YOU CAME TO CONCEAL THIS
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
WELL SIR IT WAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT OUR OWN TROUBLE CAME TO US
AND THEN AGAIN SIR WE WERE BOTH OF US VERY FOND OF SIR CHARLES AS
WE WELL MIGHT BE CONSIDERING ALL THAT HE HAS DONE FOR US TO RAKE
THIS UP COULDNT HELP OUR POOR MASTER AND ITS WELL TO GO CAREFULLY
WHEN THERES A LADY IN THE CASE EVEN THE BEST OF US
YOU THOUGHT IT MIGHT INJURE HIS REPUTATION
WELL SIR I THOUGHT NO GOOD COULD COME OF IT BUT NOW YOU HAVE BEEN
KIND TO US AND I FEEL AS IF IT WOULD BE TREATING YOU UNFAIRLY NOT TO
TELL YOU ALL THAT I KNOW ABOUT THE MATTER
VERY GOOD BARRYMORE YOU CAN GO WHEN THE BUTLER HAD LEFT US SIR
HENRY TURNED TO ME WELL WATSON WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS NEW
LIGHT
IT SEEMS TO LEAVE THE DARKNESS RATHER BLACKER THAN BEFORE
SO I THINK BUT IF WE CAN ONLY TRACE L L IT SHOULD CLEAR UP THE
WHOLE BUSINESS WE HAVE GAINED THAT MUCH WE KNOW THAT THERE IS
SOMEONE WHO HAS THE FACTS IF WE CAN ONLY FIND HER WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO
LET HOLMES KNOW ALL ABOUT IT AT ONCE IT WILL GIVE HIM THE CLUE FOR
WHICH HE HAS BEEN SEEKING I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF IT DOES NOT BRING
HIM DOWN
I WENT AT ONCE TO MY ROOM AND DREW UP MY REPORT OF THE MORNINGS
CONVERSATION FOR HOLMES IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT HE HAD BEEN VERY
BUSY OF LATE FOR THE NOTES WHICH I HAD FROM BAKER STREET WERE FEW
AND SHORT WITH NO COMMENTS UPON THE INFORMATION WHICH I HAD SUPPLIED
AND HARDLY ANY REFERENCE TO MY MISSION NO DOUBT HIS BLACKMAILING
CASE IS ABSORBING ALL HIS FACULTIES AND YET THIS NEW FACTOR MUST
SURELY ARREST HIS ATTENTION AND RENEW HIS INTEREST I WISH THAT HE
WERE HERE
OCTOBER THALL DAY TODAY THE RAIN POURED DOWN RUSTLING ON THE
IVY AND DRIPPING FROM THE EAVES I THOUGHT OF THE CONVICT OUT UPON
THE BLEAK COLD SHELTERLESS MOOR POOR DEVIL WHATEVER HIS CRIMES
HE HAS SUFFERED SOMETHING TO ATONE FOR THEM AND THEN I THOUGHT OF
THAT OTHER ONETHE FACE IN THE CAB THE FIGURE AGAINST THE MOON WAS
HE ALSO OUT IN THAT DELUGEDTHE UNSEEN WATCHER THE MAN OF DARKNESS
IN THE EVENING I PUT ON MY WATERPROOF AND I WALKED FAR UPON THE
SODDEN MOOR FULL OF DARK IMAGININGS THE RAIN BEATING UPON MY FACE
AND THE WIND WHISTLING ABOUT MY EARS GOD HELP THOSE WHO WANDER INTO
THE GREAT MIRE NOW FOR EVEN THE FIRM UPLANDS ARE BECOMING A MORASS
I FOUND THE BLACK TOR UPON WHICH I HAD SEEN THE SOLITARY WATCHER AND
FROM ITS CRAGGY SUMMIT I LOOKED OUT MYSELF ACROSS THE MELANCHOLY
DOWNS RAIN SQUALLS DRIFTED ACROSS THEIR RUSSET FACE AND THE HEAVY
SLATECOLOURED CLOUDS HUNG LOW OVER THE LANDSCAPE TRAILING IN GRAY
WREATHS DOWN THE SIDES OF THE FANTASTIC HILLS IN THE DISTANT HOLLOW
ON THE LEFT HALF HIDDEN BY THE MIST THE TWO THIN TOWERS OF
BASKERVILLE HALL ROSE ABOVE THE TREES THEY WERE THE ONLY SIGNS OF
HUMAN LIFE WHICH I COULD SEE SAVE ONLY THOSE PREHISTORIC HUTS WHICH
LAY THICKLY UPON THE SLOPES OF THE HILLS NOWHERE WAS THERE ANY TRACE
OF THAT LONELY MAN WHOM I HAD SEEN ON THE SAME SPOT TWO NIGHTS
BEFORE
AS I WALKED BACK I WAS OVERTAKEN BY DR MORTIMER DRIVING IN HIS
DOGCART OVER A ROUGH MOORLAND TRACK WHICH LED FROM THE OUTLYING
FARMHOUSE OF FOULMIRE HE HAS BEEN VERY ATTENTIVE TO US AND HARDLY A
DAY HAS PASSED THAT HE HAS NOT CALLED AT THE HALL TO SEE HOW WE WERE
GETTING ON HE INSISTED UPON MY CLIMBING INTO HIS DOGCART AND HE
GAVE ME A LIFT HOMEWARD I FOUND HIM MUCH TROUBLED OVER THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF HIS LITTLE SPANIEL IT HAD WANDERED ON TO THE MOOR
AND HAD NEVER COME BACK I GAVE HIM SUCH CONSOLATION AS I MIGHT BUT
I THOUGHT OF THE PONY ON THE GRIMPEN MIRE AND I DO NOT FANCY THAT HE
WILL SEE HIS LITTLE DOG AGAIN
BY THE WAY MORTIMER SAID I AS WE JOLTED ALONG THE ROUGH ROAD I
SUPPOSE THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN DRIVING DISTANCE OF THIS
WHOM YOU DO NOT KNOW
HARDLY ANY I THINK
CAN YOU THEN TELL ME THE NAME OF ANY WOMAN WHOSE INITIALS ARE L
L
HE THOUGHT FOR A FEW MINUTES
NO SAID HE THERE ARE A FEW GIPSIES AND LABOURING FOLK FOR WHOM I
CANT ANSWER BUT AMONG THE FARMERS OR GENTRY THERE IS NO ONE WHOSE
INITIALS ARE THOSE WAIT A BIT THOUGH HE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE
THERE IS LAURA LYONSHER INITIALS ARE L LBUT SHE LIVES IN
COOMBE TRACEY
WHO IS SHE I ASKED
SHE IS FRANKLANDS DAUGHTER
WHAT OLD FRANKLAND THE CRANK
EXACTLY SHE MARRIED AN ARTIST NAMED LYONS WHO CAME SKETCHING ON
THE MOOR HE PROVED TO BE A BLACKGUARD AND DESERTED HER THE FAULT
FROM WHAT I HEAR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY ON ONE SIDE HER FATHER
REFUSED TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER BECAUSE SHE HAD MARRIED
WITHOUT HIS CONSENT AND PERHAPS FOR ONE OR TWO OTHER REASONS AS
WELL SO BETWEEN THE OLD SINNER AND THE YOUNG ONE THE GIRL HAS HAD A
PRETTY BAD TIME
HOW DOES SHE LIVE
I FANCY OLD FRANKLAND ALLOWS HER A PITTANCE BUT IT CANNOT BE MORE
FOR HIS OWN AFFAIRS ARE CONSIDERABLY INVOLVED WHATEVER SHE MAY HAVE
DESERVED ONE COULD NOT ALLOW HER TO GO HOPELESSLY TO THE BAD HER
STORY GOT ABOUT AND SEVERAL OF THE PEOPLE HERE DID SOMETHING TO
ENABLE HER TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING STAPLETON DID FOR ONE AND SIR
CHARLES FOR ANOTHER I GAVE A TRIFLE MYSELF IT WAS TO SET HER UP IN
A TYPEWRITING BUSINESS
HE WANTED TO KNOW THE OBJECT OF MY INQUIRIES BUT I MANAGED TO
SATISFY HIS CURIOSITY WITHOUT TELLING HIM TOO MUCH FOR THERE IS NO
REASON WHY WE SHOULD TAKE ANYONE INTO OUR CONFIDENCE TOMORROW
MORNING I SHALL FIND MY WAY TO COOMBE TRACEY AND IF I CAN SEE THIS
MRS LAURA LYONS OF EQUIVOCAL REPUTATION A LONG STEP WILL HAVE BEEN
MADE TOWARDS CLEARING ONE INCIDENT IN THIS CHAIN OF MYSTERIES I AM
CERTAINLY DEVELOPING THE WISDOM OF THE SERPENT FOR WHEN MORTIMER
PRESSED HIS QUESTIONS TO AN INCONVENIENT EXTENT I ASKED HIM CASUALLY
TO WHAT TYPE FRANKLANDS SKULL BELONGED AND SO HEARD NOTHING BUT
CRANIOLOGY FOR THE REST OF OUR DRIVE I HAVE NOT LIVED FOR YEARS WITH
SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR NOTHING
I HAVE ONLY ONE OTHER INCIDENT TO RECORD UPON THIS TEMPESTUOUS AND
MELANCHOLY DAY THIS WAS MY CONVERSATION WITH BARRYMORE JUST NOW
WHICH GIVES ME ONE MORE STRONG CARD WHICH I CAN PLAY IN DUE TIME
MORTIMER HAD STAYED TO DINNER AND HE AND THE BARONET PLAYED CART
AFTERWARDS THE BUTLER BROUGHT ME MY COFFEE INTO THE LIBRARY AND I
TOOK THE CHANCE TO ASK HIM A FEW QUESTIONS
WELL SAID I HAS THIS PRECIOUS RELATION OF YOURS DEPARTED OR IS
HE STILL LURKING OUT YONDER
I DONT KNOW SIR I HOPE TO HEAVEN THAT HE HAS GONE FOR HE HAS
BROUGHT NOTHING BUT TROUBLE HERE IVE NOT HEARD OF HIM SINCE I LEFT
OUT FOOD FOR HIM LAST AND THAT WAS THREE DAYS AGO
DID YOU SEE HIM THEN
NO SIR BUT THE FOOD WAS GONE WHEN NEXT I WENT THAT WAY
THEN HE WAS CERTAINLY THERE
SO YOU WOULD THINK SIR UNLESS IT WAS THE OTHER MAN WHO TOOK IT
I SAT WITH MY COFFEECUP HALFWAY TO MY LIPS AND STARED AT BARRYMORE
YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS ANOTHER MAN THEN
YES SIR THERE IS ANOTHER MAN UPON THE MOOR
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM
NO SIR
HOW DO YOU KNOW OF HIM THEN
SELDEN TOLD ME OF HIM SIR A WEEK AGO OR MORE HES IN HIDING TOO
BUT HES NOT A CONVICT AS FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT I DONT LIKE IT DR
WATSONI TELL YOU STRAIGHT SIR THAT I DONT LIKE IT HE SPOKE
WITH A SUDDEN PASSION OF EARNESTNESS
NOW LISTEN TO ME BARRYMORE I HAVE NO INTEREST IN THIS MATTER BUT
THAT OF YOUR MASTER I HAVE COME HERE WITH NO OBJECT EXCEPT TO HELP
HIM TELL ME FRANKLY WHAT IT IS THAT YOU DONT LIKE
BARRYMORE HESITATED FOR A MOMENT AS IF HE REGRETTED HIS OUTBURST OR
FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO EXPRESS HIS OWN FEELINGS IN WORDS
ITS ALL THESE GOINGSON SIR HE CRIED AT LAST WAVING HIS HAND
TOWARDS THE RAINLASHED WINDOW WHICH FACED THE MOOR THERES FOUL
PLAY SOMEWHERE AND THERES BLACK VILLAINY BREWING TO THAT ILL
SWEAR VERY GLAD I SHOULD BE SIR TO SEE SIR HENRY ON HIS WAY BACK
TO LONDON AGAIN
BUT WHAT IS IT THAT ALARMS YOU
LOOK AT SIR CHARLESS DEATH THAT WAS BAD ENOUGH FOR ALL THAT THE
CORONER SAID LOOK AT THE NOISES ON THE MOOR AT NIGHT THERES NOT A
MAN WOULD CROSS IT AFTER SUNDOWN IF HE WAS PAID FOR IT LOOK AT THIS
STRANGER HIDING OUT YONDER AND WATCHING AND WAITING WHATS HE
WAITING FOR WHAT DOES IT MEAN IT MEANS NO GOOD TO ANYONE OF THE
NAME OF BASKERVILLE AND VERY GLAD I SHALL BE TO BE QUIT OF IT ALL ON
THE DAY THAT SIR HENRYS NEW SERVANTS ARE READY TO TAKE OVER THE
HALL
BUT ABOUT THIS STRANGER SAID I CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT
HIM WHAT DID SELDEN SAY DID HE FIND OUT WHERE HE HID OR WHAT HE
WAS DOING
HE SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE BUT HE IS A DEEP ONE AND GIVES NOTHING
AWAY AT FIRST HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS THE POLICE BUT SOON HE FOUND
THAT HE HAD SOME LAY OF HIS OWN A KIND OF GENTLEMAN HE WAS AS FAR
AS HE COULD SEE BUT WHAT HE WAS DOING HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT
AND WHERE DID HE SAY THAT HE LIVED
AMONG THE OLD HOUSES ON THE HILLSIDETHE STONE HUTS WHERE THE OLD
FOLK USED TO LIVE
BUT HOW ABOUT HIS FOOD
SELDEN FOUND OUT THAT HE HAS GOT A LAD WHO WORKS FOR HIM AND BRINGS
HIM ALL HE NEEDS I DARE SAY HE GOES TO COOMBE TRACEY FOR WHAT HE
WANTS
VERY GOOD BARRYMORE WE MAY TALK FURTHER OF THIS SOME OTHER TIME
WHEN THE BUTLER HAD GONE I WALKED OVER TO THE BLACK WINDOW AND I
LOOKED THROUGH A BLURRED PANE AT THE DRIVING CLOUDS AND AT THE
TOSSING OUTLINE OF THE WINDSWEPT TREES IT IS A WILD NIGHT INDOORS
AND WHAT MUST IT BE IN A STONE HUT UPON THE MOOR WHAT PASSION OF
HATRED CAN IT BE WHICH LEADS A MAN TO LURK IN SUCH A PLACE AT SUCH A
TIME AND WHAT DEEP AND EARNEST PURPOSE CAN HE HAVE WHICH CALLS FOR
SUCH A TRIAL THERE IN THAT HUT UPON THE MOOR SEEMS TO LIE THE VERY
CENTRE OF THAT PROBLEM WHICH HAS VEXED ME SO SORELY I SWEAR THAT
ANOTHER DAY SHALL NOT HAVE PASSED BEFORE I HAVE DONE ALL THAT MAN CAN
DO TO REACH THE HEART OF THE MYSTERY
CHAPTER XI
THE MAN ON THE TOR
THE EXTRACT FROM MY PRIVATE DIARY WHICH FORMS THE LAST CHAPTER HAS
BROUGHT MY NARRATIVE UP TO THE TH OF OCTOBER A TIME WHEN THESE
STRANGE EVENTS BEGAN TO MOVE SWIFTLY TOWARDS THEIR TERRIBLE
CONCLUSION THE INCIDENTS OF THE NEXT FEW DAYS ARE INDELIBLY GRAVEN
UPON MY RECOLLECTION AND I CAN TELL THEM WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE
NOTES MADE AT THE TIME I START THEN FROM THE DAY WHICH SUCCEEDED
THAT UPON WHICH I HAD ESTABLISHED TWO FACTS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THE
ONE THAT MRS LAURA LYONS OF COOMBE TRACEY HAD WRITTEN TO SIR CHARLES
BASKERVILLE AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM AT THE VERY PLACE AND
HOUR THAT HE MET HIS DEATH THE OTHER THAT THE LURKING MAN UPON THE
MOOR WAS TO BE FOUND AMONG THE STONE HUTS UPON THE HILLSIDE WITH
THESE TWO FACTS IN MY POSSESSION I FELT THAT EITHER MY INTELLIGENCE
OR MY COURAGE MUST BE DEFICIENT IF I COULD NOT THROW SOME FURTHER
LIGHT UPON THESE DARK PLACES
I HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO TELL THE BARONET WHAT I HAD LEARNED ABOUT
MRS LYONS UPON THE EVENING BEFORE FOR DR MORTIMER REMAINED WITH
HIM AT CARDS UNTIL IT WAS VERY LATE AT BREAKFAST HOWEVER I
INFORMED HIM ABOUT MY DISCOVERY AND ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WOULD CARE
TO ACCOMPANY ME TO COOMBE TRACEY AT FIRST HE WAS VERY EAGER TO COME
BUT ON SECOND THOUGHTS IT SEEMED TO BOTH OF US THAT IF I WENT ALONE
THE RESULTS MIGHT BE BETTER THE MORE FORMAL WE MADE THE VISIT THE
LESS INFORMATION WE MIGHT OBTAIN I LEFT SIR HENRY BEHIND THEREFORE
NOT WITHOUT SOME PRICKINGS OF CONSCIENCE AND DROVE OFF UPON MY NEW
QUEST
WHEN I REACHED COOMBE TRACEY I TOLD PERKINS TO PUT UP THE HORSES AND
I MADE INQUIRIES FOR THE LADY WHOM I HAD COME TO INTERROGATE I HAD
NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING HER ROOMS WHICH WERE CENTRAL AND WELL
APPOINTED A MAID SHOWED ME IN WITHOUT CEREMONY AND AS I ENTERED THE
SITTINGROOM A LADY WHO WAS SITTING BEFORE A REMINGTON TYPEWRITER
SPRANG UP WITH A PLEASANT SMILE OF WELCOME HER FACE FELL HOWEVER
WHEN SHE SAW THAT I WAS A STRANGER AND SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND ASKED
ME THE OBJECT OF MY VISIT
THE FIRST IMPRESSION LEFT BY MRS LYONS WAS ONE OF EXTREME BEAUTY
HER EYES AND HAIR WERE OF THE SAME RICH HAZEL COLOUR AND HER CHEEKS
THOUGH CONSIDERABLY FRECKLED WERE FLUSHED WITH THE EXQUISITE BLOOM
OF THE BRUNETTE THE DAINTY PINK WHICH LURKS AT THE HEART OF THE
SULPHUR ROSE ADMIRATION WAS I REPEAT THE FIRST IMPRESSION BUT THE
SECOND WAS CRITICISM THERE WAS SOMETHING SUBTLY WRONG WITH THE FACE
SOME COARSENESS OF EXPRESSION SOME HARDNESS PERHAPS OF EYE SOME
LOOSENESS OF LIP WHICH MARRED ITS PERFECT BEAUTY BUT THESE OF
COURSE ARE AFTERTHOUGHTS AT THE MOMENT I WAS SIMPLY CONSCIOUS THAT
I WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF A VERY HANDSOME WOMAN AND THAT SHE WAS
ASKING ME THE REASONS FOR MY VISIT I HAD NOT QUITE UNDERSTOOD UNTIL
THAT INSTANT HOW DELICATE MY MISSION WAS
I HAVE THE PLEASURE SAID I OF KNOWING YOUR FATHER IT WAS A
CLUMSY INTRODUCTION AND THE LADY MADE ME FEEL IT
THERE IS NOTHING IN COMMON BETWEEN MY FATHER AND ME SHE SAID I
OWE HIM NOTHING AND HIS FRIENDS ARE NOT MINE IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE
LATE SIR CHARLES BASKERVILLE AND SOME OTHER KIND HEARTS I MIGHT HAVE
STARVED FOR ALL THAT MY FATHER CARED
IT WAS ABOUT THE LATE SIR CHARLES BASKERVILLE THAT I HAVE COME HERE
TO SEE YOU
THE FRECKLES STARTED OUT ON THE LADYS FACE
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU ABOUT HIM SHE ASKED AND HER FINGERS PLAYED
NERVOUSLY OVER THE STOPS OF HER TYPEWRITER
YOU KNEW HIM DID YOU NOT
I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT I OWE A GREAT DEAL TO HIS KINDNESS IF I AM
ABLE TO SUPPORT MYSELF IT IS LARGELY DUE TO THE INTEREST WHICH HE
TOOK IN MY UNHAPPY SITUATION
DID YOU CORRESPOND WITH HIM
THE LADY LOOKED QUICKLY UP WITH AN ANGRY GLEAM IN HER HAZEL EYES
WHAT IS THE OBJECT OF THESE QUESTIONS SHE ASKED SHARPLY
THE OBJECT IS TO AVOID A PUBLIC SCANDAL IT IS BETTER THAT I SHOULD
ASK THEM HERE THAN THAT THE MATTER SHOULD PASS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL
SHE WAS SILENT AND HER FACE WAS STILL VERY PALE AT LAST SHE LOOKED
UP WITH SOMETHING RECKLESS AND DEFIANT IN HER MANNER
WELL ILL ANSWER SHE SAID WHAT ARE YOUR QUESTIONS
DID YOU CORRESPOND WITH SIR CHARLES
I CERTAINLY WROTE TO HIM ONCE OR TWICE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS DELICACY
AND HIS GENEROSITY
HAVE YOU THE DATES OF THOSE LETTERS
NO
HAVE YOU EVER MET HIM
YES ONCE OR TWICE WHEN HE CAME INTO COOMBE TRACEY HE WAS A VERY
RETIRING MAN AND HE PREFERRED TO DO GOOD BY STEALTH
BUT IF YOU SAW HIM SO SELDOM AND WROTE SO SELDOM HOW DID HE KNOW
ENOUGH ABOUT YOUR AFFAIRS TO BE ABLE TO HELP YOU AS YOU SAY THAT HE
HAS DONE
SHE MET MY DIFFICULTY WITH THE UTMOST READINESS
THERE WERE SEVERAL GENTLEMEN WHO KNEW MY SAD HISTORY AND UNITED TO
HELP ME ONE WAS MR STAPLETON A NEIGHBOUR AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF
SIR CHARLESS HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY KIND AND IT WAS THROUGH HIM THAT
SIR CHARLES LEARNED ABOUT MY AFFAIRS
I KNEW ALREADY THAT SIR CHARLES BASKERVILLE HAD MADE STAPLETON HIS
ALMONER UPON SEVERAL OCCASIONS SO THE LADYS STATEMENT BORE THE
IMPRESS OF TRUTH UPON IT
DID YOU EVER WRITE TO SIR CHARLES ASKING HIM TO MEET YOU I
CONTINUED
MRS LYONS FLUSHED WITH ANGER AGAIN
REALLY SIR THIS IS A VERY EXTRAORDINARY QUESTION
I AM SORRY MADAM BUT I MUST REPEAT IT
THEN I ANSWER CERTAINLY NOT
NOT ON THE VERY DAY OF SIR CHARLESS DEATH
THE FLUSH HAD FADED IN AN INSTANT AND A DEATHLY FACE WAS BEFORE ME
HER DRY LIPS COULD NOT SPEAK THE NO WHICH I SAW RATHER THAN HEARD
SURELY YOUR MEMORY DECEIVES YOU SAID I I COULD EVEN QUOTE A
PASSAGE OF YOUR LETTER IT RAN PLEASE PLEASE AS YOU ARE A
GENTLEMAN BURN THIS LETTER AND BE AT THE GATE BY TEN OCLOCK
I THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD FAINTED BUT SHE RECOVERED HERSELF BY A
SUPREME EFFORT
IS THERE NO SUCH THING AS A GENTLEMAN SHE GASPED
YOU DO SIR CHARLES AN INJUSTICE HE DID BURN THE LETTER BUT
SOMETIMES A LETTER MAY BE LEGIBLE EVEN WHEN BURNED YOU ACKNOWLEDGE
NOW THAT YOU WROTE IT
YES I DID WRITE IT SHE CRIED POURING OUT HER SOUL IN A TORRENT
OF WORDS I DID WRITE IT WHY SHOULD I DENY IT I HAVE NO REASON TO
BE ASHAMED OF IT I WISHED HIM TO HELP ME I BELIEVED THAT IF I HAD
AN INTERVIEW I COULD GAIN HIS HELP SO I ASKED HIM TO MEET ME
BUT WHY AT SUCH AN HOUR
BECAUSE I HAD ONLY JUST LEARNED THAT HE WAS GOING TO LONDON NEXT DAY
AND MIGHT BE AWAY FOR MONTHS THERE WERE REASONS WHY I COULD NOT GET
THERE EARLIER
BUT WHY A RENDEZVOUS IN THE GARDEN INSTEAD OF A VISIT TO THE HOUSE
DO YOU THINK A WOMAN COULD GO ALONE AT THAT HOUR TO A BACHELORS
HOUSE
WELL WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU DID GET THERE
I NEVER WENT
MRS LYONS
NO I SWEAR IT TO YOU ON ALL I HOLD SACRED I NEVER WENT SOMETHING
INTERVENED TO PREVENT MY GOING
WHAT WAS THAT
THAT IS A PRIVATE MATTER I CANNOT TELL IT
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THEN THAT YOU MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH SIR CHARLES
AT THE VERY HOUR AND PLACE AT WHICH HE MET HIS DEATH BUT YOU DENY
THAT YOU KEPT THE APPOINTMENT
THAT IS THE TRUTH
AGAIN AND AGAIN I CROSSQUESTIONED HER BUT I COULD NEVER GET PAST
THAT POINT
MRS LYONS SAID I AS I ROSE FROM THIS LONG AND INCONCLUSIVE
INTERVIEW YOU ARE TAKING A VERY GREAT RESPONSIBILITY AND PUTTING
YOURSELF IN A VERY FALSE POSITION BY NOT MAKING AN ABSOLUTELY CLEAN
BREAST OF ALL THAT YOU KNOW IF I HAVE TO CALL IN THE AID OF THE
POLICE YOU WILL FIND HOW SERIOUSLY YOU ARE COMPROMISED IF YOUR
POSITION IS INNOCENT WHY DID YOU IN THE FIRST INSTANCE DENY HAVING
WRITTEN TO SIR CHARLES UPON THAT DATE
BECAUSE I FEARED THAT SOME FALSE CONCLUSION MIGHT BE DRAWN FROM IT
AND THAT I MIGHT FIND MYSELF INVOLVED IN A SCANDAL
AND WHY WERE YOU SO PRESSING THAT SIR CHARLES SHOULD DESTROY YOUR
LETTER
IF YOU HAVE READ THE LETTER YOU WILL KNOW
I DID NOT SAY THAT I HAD READ ALL THE LETTER
YOU QUOTED SOME OF IT
I QUOTED THE POSTSCRIPT THE LETTER HAD AS I SAID BEEN BURNED AND
IT WAS NOT ALL LEGIBLE I ASK YOU ONCE AGAIN WHY IT WAS THAT YOU WERE
SO PRESSING THAT SIR CHARLES SHOULD DESTROY THIS LETTER WHICH HE
RECEIVED ON THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
THE MATTER IS A VERY PRIVATE ONE
THE MORE REASON WHY YOU SHOULD AVOID A PUBLIC INVESTIGATION
I WILL TELL YOU THEN IF YOU HAVE HEARD ANYTHING OF MY UNHAPPY
HISTORY YOU WILL KNOW THAT I MADE A RASH MARRIAGE AND HAD REASON TO
REGRET IT
I HAVE HEARD SO MUCH
MY LIFE HAS BEEN ONE INCESSANT PERSECUTION FROM A HUSBAND WHOM I
ABHOR THE LAW IS UPON HIS SIDE AND EVERY DAY I AM FACED BY THE
POSSIBILITY THAT HE MAY FORCE ME TO LIVE WITH HIM AT THE TIME THAT I
WROTE THIS LETTER TO SIR CHARLES I HAD LEARNED THAT THERE WAS A
PROSPECT OF MY REGAINING MY FREEDOM IF CERTAIN EXPENSES COULD BE MET
IT MEANT EVERYTHING TO MEPEACE OF MIND HAPPINESS
SELFRESPECTEVERYTHING I KNEW SIR CHARLESS GENEROSITY AND I
THOUGHT THAT IF HE HEARD THE STORY FROM MY OWN LIPS HE WOULD HELP
ME
THEN HOW IS IT THAT YOU DID NOT GO
BECAUSE I RECEIVED HELP IN THE INTERVAL FROM ANOTHER SOURCE
WHY THEN DID YOU NOT WRITE TO SIR CHARLES AND EXPLAIN THIS
SO I SHOULD HAVE DONE HAD I NOT SEEN HIS DEATH IN THE PAPER NEXT
MORNING
THE WOMANS STORY HUNG COHERENTLY TOGETHER AND ALL MY QUESTIONS WERE
UNABLE TO SHAKE IT I COULD ONLY CHECK IT BY FINDING IF SHE HAD
INDEED INSTITUTED DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST HER HUSBAND AT OR
ABOUT THE TIME OF THE TRAGEDY
IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT SHE WOULD DARE TO SAY THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN TO
BASKERVILLE HALL IF SHE REALLY HAD BEEN FOR A TRAP WOULD BE
NECESSARY TO TAKE HER THERE AND COULD NOT HAVE RETURNED TO COOMBE
TRACEY UNTIL THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING SUCH AN EXCURSION COULD
NOT BE KEPT SECRET THE PROBABILITY WAS THEREFORE THAT SHE WAS
TELLING THE TRUTH OR AT LEAST A PART OF THE TRUTH I CAME AWAY
BAFFLED AND DISHEARTENED ONCE AGAIN I HAD REACHED THAT DEAD WALL
WHICH SEEMED TO BE BUILT ACROSS EVERY PATH BY WHICH I TRIED TO GET AT
THE OBJECT OF MY MISSION AND YET THE MORE I THOUGHT OF THE LADYS
FACE AND OF HER MANNER THE MORE I FELT THAT SOMETHING WAS BEING HELD
BACK FROM ME WHY SHOULD SHE TURN SO PALE WHY SHOULD SHE FIGHT
AGAINST EVERY ADMISSION UNTIL IT WAS FORCED FROM HER WHY SHOULD SHE
HAVE BEEN SO RETICENT AT THE TIME OF THE TRAGEDY SURELY THE
EXPLANATION OF ALL THIS COULD NOT BE AS INNOCENT AS SHE WOULD HAVE ME
BELIEVE FOR THE MOMENT I COULD PROCEED NO FARTHER IN THAT DIRECTION
BUT MUST TURN BACK TO THAT OTHER CLUE WHICH WAS TO BE SOUGHT FOR
AMONG THE STONE HUTS UPON THE MOOR
AND THAT WAS A MOST VAGUE DIRECTION I REALIZED IT AS I DROVE BACK
AND NOTED HOW HILL AFTER HILL SHOWED TRACES OF THE ANCIENT PEOPLE
BARRYMORES ONLY INDICATION HAD BEEN THAT THE STRANGER LIVED IN ONE
OF THESE ABANDONED HUTS AND MANY HUNDREDS OF THEM ARE SCATTERED
THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE MOOR BUT I HAD MY OWN
EXPERIENCE FOR A GUIDE SINCE IT HAD SHOWN ME THE MAN HIMSELF STANDING
UPON THE SUMMIT OF THE BLACK TOR THAT THEN SHOULD BE THE CENTRE OF
MY SEARCH FROM THERE I SHOULD EXPLORE EVERY HUT UPON THE MOOR UNTIL
I LIGHTED UPON THE RIGHT ONE IF THIS MAN WERE INSIDE IT I SHOULD
FIND OUT FROM HIS OWN LIPS AT THE POINT OF MY REVOLVER IF NECESSARY
WHO HE WAS AND WHY HE HAD DOGGED US SO LONG HE MIGHT SLIP AWAY FROM
US IN THE CROWD OF REGENT STREET BUT IT WOULD PUZZLE HIM TO DO SO
UPON THE LONELY MOOR ON THE OTHER HAND IF I SHOULD FIND THE HUT AND
ITS TENANT SHOULD NOT BE WITHIN IT I MUST REMAIN THERE HOWEVER LONG
THE VIGIL UNTIL HE RETURNED HOLMES HAD MISSED HIM IN LONDON IT
WOULD INDEED BE A TRIUMPH FOR ME IF I COULD RUN HIM TO EARTH WHERE
MY MASTER HAD FAILED
LUCK HAD BEEN AGAINST US AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THIS INQUIRY BUT NOW AT
LAST IT CAME TO MY AID AND THE MESSENGER OF GOOD FORTUNE WAS NONE
OTHER THAN MR FRANKLAND WHO WAS STANDING GRAYWHISKERED AND
REDFACED OUTSIDE THE GATE OF HIS GARDEN WHICH OPENED ON TO THE
HIGH ROAD ALONG WHICH I TRAVELLED
GOODDAY DR WATSON CRIED HE WITH UNWONTED GOOD HUMOUR YOU MUST
REALLY GIVE YOUR HORSES A REST AND COME IN TO HAVE A GLASS OF WINE
AND TO CONGRATULATE ME
MY FEELINGS TOWARDS HIM WERE VERY FAR FROM BEING FRIENDLY AFTER WHAT
I HAD HEARD OF HIS TREATMENT OF HIS DAUGHTER BUT I WAS ANXIOUS TO
SEND PERKINS AND THE WAGONETTE HOME AND THE OPPORTUNITY WAS A GOOD
ONE I ALIGHTED AND SENT A MESSAGE TO SIR HENRY THAT I SHOULD WALK
OVER IN TIME FOR DINNER THEN I FOLLOWED FRANKLAND INTO HIS
DININGROOM
IT IS A GREAT DAY FOR ME SIRONE OF THE REDLETTER DAYS OF MY
LIFE HE CRIED WITH MANY CHUCKLES I HAVE BROUGHT OFF A DOUBLE
EVENT I MEAN TO TEACH THEM IN THESE PARTS THAT LAW IS LAW AND THAT
THERE IS A MAN HERE WHO DOES NOT FEAR TO INVOKE IT I HAVE
ESTABLISHED A RIGHT OF WAY THROUGH THE CENTRE OF OLD MIDDLETONS
PARK SLAP ACROSS IT SIR WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF HIS OWN FRONT
DOOR WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT WELL TEACH THESE MAGNATES THAT THEY
CANNOT RIDE ROUGHSHOD OVER THE RIGHTS OF THE COMMONERS CONFOUND
THEM AND IVE CLOSED THE WOOD WHERE THE FERNWORTHY FOLK USED TO
PICNIC THESE INFERNAL PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK THAT THERE ARE NO RIGHTS
OF PROPERTY AND THAT THEY CAN SWARM WHERE THEY LIKE WITH THEIR
PAPERS AND THEIR BOTTLES BOTH CASES DECIDED DR WATSON AND BOTH IN
MY FAVOUR I HAVENT HAD SUCH A DAY SINCE I HAD SIR JOHN MORLAND FOR
TRESPASS BECAUSE HE SHOT IN HIS OWN WARREN
HOW ON EARTH DID YOU DO THAT
LOOK IT UP IN THE BOOKS SIR IT WILL REPAY READINGFRANKLAND V
MORLAND COURT OF QUEENS BENCH IT COST ME POUNDS BUT I GOT MY
VERDICT
DID IT DO YOU ANY GOOD
NONE SIR NONE I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT I HAD NO INTEREST IN THE
MATTER I ACT ENTIRELY FROM A SENSE OF PUBLIC DUTY I HAVE NO DOUBT
FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE FERNWORTHY PEOPLE WILL BURN ME IN EFFIGY
TONIGHT I TOLD THE POLICE LAST TIME THEY DID IT THAT THEY SHOULD
STOP THESE DISGRACEFUL EXHIBITIONS THE COUNTY CONSTABULARY IS IN A
SCANDALOUS STATE SIR AND IT HAS NOT AFFORDED ME THE PROTECTION TO
WHICH I AM ENTITLED THE CASE OF FRANKLAND V REGINA WILL BRING THE
MATTER BEFORE THE ATTENTION OF THE PUBLIC I TOLD THEM THAT THEY
WOULD HAVE OCCASION TO REGRET THEIR TREATMENT OF ME AND ALREADY MY
WORDS HAVE COME TRUE
HOW SO I ASKED
THE OLD MAN PUT ON A VERY KNOWING EXPRESSION
BECAUSE I COULD TELL THEM WHAT THEY ARE DYING TO KNOW BUT NOTHING
WOULD INDUCE ME TO HELP THE RASCALS IN ANY WAY
I HAD BEEN CASTING ROUND FOR SOME EXCUSE BY WHICH I COULD GET AWAY
FROM HIS GOSSIP BUT NOW I BEGAN TO WISH TO HEAR MORE OF IT I HAD
SEEN ENOUGH OF THE CONTRARY NATURE OF THE OLD SINNER TO UNDERSTAND
THAT ANY STRONG SIGN OF INTEREST WOULD BE THE SUREST WAY TO STOP HIS
CONFIDENCES
SOME POACHING CASE NO DOUBT SAID I WITH AN INDIFFERENT MANNER
HA HA MY BOY A VERY MUCH MORE IMPORTANT MATTER THAN THAT WHAT
ABOUT THE CONVICT ON THE MOOR
I STARTED YOU DONT MEAN THAT YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS SAID I
I MAY NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHERE HE IS BUT I AM QUITE SURE THAT I COULD
HELP THE POLICE TO LAY THEIR HANDS ON HIM HAS IT NEVER STRUCK YOU
THAT THE WAY TO CATCH THAT MAN WAS TO FIND OUT WHERE HE GOT HIS FOOD
AND SO TRACE IT TO HIM
HE CERTAINLY SEEMED TO BE GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY NEAR THE TRUTH NO
DOUBT SAID I BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT HE IS ANYWHERE UPON THE
MOOR
I KNOW IT BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES THE MESSENGER WHO
TAKES HIM HIS FOOD
MY HEART SANK FOR BARRYMORE IT WAS A SERIOUS THING TO BE IN THE
POWER OF THIS SPITEFUL OLD BUSYBODY BUT HIS NEXT REMARK TOOK A
WEIGHT FROM MY MIND
YOULL BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT HIS FOOD IS TAKEN TO HIM BY A
CHILD I SEE HIM EVERY DAY THROUGH MY TELESCOPE UPON THE ROOF HE
PASSES ALONG THE SAME PATH AT THE SAME HOUR AND TO WHOM SHOULD HE BE
GOING EXCEPT TO THE CONVICT
HERE WAS LUCK INDEED AND YET I SUPPRESSED ALL APPEARANCE OF
INTEREST A CHILD BARRYMORE HAD SAID THAT OUR UNKNOWN WAS SUPPLIED
BY A BOY IT WAS ON HIS TRACK AND NOT UPON THE CONVICTS THAT
FRANKLAND HAD STUMBLED IF I COULD GET HIS KNOWLEDGE IT MIGHT SAVE ME
A LONG AND WEARY HUNT BUT INCREDULITY AND INDIFFERENCE WERE
EVIDENTLY MY STRONGEST CARDS
I SHOULD SAY THAT IT WAS MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT IT WAS THE SON OF ONE
OF THE MOORLAND SHEPHERDS TAKING OUT HIS FATHERS DINNER
THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF OPPOSITION STRUCK FIRE OUT OF THE OLD
AUTOCRAT HIS EYES LOOKED MALIGNANTLY AT ME AND HIS GRAY WHISKERS
BRISTLED LIKE THOSE OF AN ANGRY CAT
INDEED SIR SAID HE POINTING OUT OVER THE WIDESTRETCHING MOOR
DO YOU SEE THAT BLACK TOR OVER YONDER WELL DO YOU SEE THE LOW HILL
BEYOND WITH THE THORNBUSH UPON IT IT IS THE STONIEST PART OF THE
WHOLE MOOR IS THAT A PLACE WHERE A SHEPHERD WOULD BE LIKELY TO TAKE
HIS STATION YOUR SUGGESTION SIR IS A MOST ABSURD ONE
I MEEKLY ANSWERED THAT I HAD SPOKEN WITHOUT KNOWING ALL THE FACTS MY
SUBMISSION PLEASED HIM AND LED HIM TO FURTHER CONFIDENCES
YOU MAY BE SURE SIR THAT I HAVE VERY GOOD GROUNDS BEFORE I COME TO
AN OPINION I HAVE SEEN THE BOY AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH HIS BUNDLE
EVERY DAY AND SOMETIMES TWICE A DAY I HAVE BEEN ABLEBUT WAIT A
MOMENT DR WATSON DO MY EYES DECEIVE ME OR IS THERE AT THE PRESENT
MOMENT SOMETHING MOVING UPON THAT HILLSIDE
IT WAS SEVERAL MILES OFF BUT I COULD DISTINCTLY SEE A SMALL DARK DOT
AGAINST THE DULL GREEN AND GRAY
COME SIR COME CRIED FRANKLAND RUSHING UPSTAIRS YOU WILL SEE
WITH YOUR OWN EYES AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF
THE TELESCOPE A FORMIDABLE INSTRUMENT MOUNTED UPON A TRIPOD STOOD
UPON THE FLAT LEADS OF THE HOUSE FRANKLAND CLAPPED HIS EYE TO IT AND
GAVE A CRY OF SATISFACTION
QUICK DR WATSON QUICK BEFORE HE PASSES OVER THE HILL
THERE HE WAS SURE ENOUGH A SMALL URCHIN WITH A LITTLE BUNDLE UPON
HIS SHOULDER TOILING SLOWLY UP THE HILL WHEN HE REACHED THE CREST I
SAW THE RAGGED UNCOUTH FIGURE OUTLINED FOR AN INSTANT AGAINST THE
COLD BLUE SKY HE LOOKED ROUND HIM WITH A FURTIVE AND STEALTHY AIR
AS ONE WHO DREADS PURSUIT THEN HE VANISHED OVER THE HILL
WELL AM I RIGHT
CERTAINLY THERE IS A BOY WHO SEEMS TO HAVE SOME SECRET ERRAND
AND WHAT THE ERRAND IS EVEN A COUNTY CONSTABLE COULD GUESS BUT NOT
ONE WORD SHALL THEY HAVE FROM ME AND I BIND YOU TO SECRECY ALSO DR
WATSON NOT A WORD YOU UNDERSTAND
JUST AS YOU WISH
THEY HAVE TREATED ME SHAMEFULLYSHAMEFULLY WHEN THE FACTS COME OUT
IN FRANKLAND V REGINA I VENTURE TO THINK THAT A THRILL OF
INDIGNATION WILL RUN THROUGH THE COUNTRY NOTHING WOULD INDUCE ME TO
HELP THE POLICE IN ANY WAY FOR ALL THEY CARED IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ME
INSTEAD OF MY EFFIGY WHICH THESE RASCALS BURNED AT THE STAKE SURELY
YOU ARE NOT GOING YOU WILL HELP ME TO EMPTY THE DECANTER IN HONOUR
OF THIS GREAT OCCASION
BUT I RESISTED ALL HIS SOLICITATIONS AND SUCCEEDED IN DISSUADING HIM
FROM HIS ANNOUNCED INTENTION OF WALKING HOME WITH ME I KEPT THE ROAD
AS LONG AS HIS EYE WAS ON ME AND THEN I STRUCK OFF ACROSS THE MOOR
AND MADE FOR THE STONY HILL OVER WHICH THE BOY HAD DISAPPEARED
EVERYTHING WAS WORKING IN MY FAVOUR AND I SWORE THAT IT SHOULD NOT
BE THROUGH LACK OF ENERGY OR PERSEVERANCE THAT I SHOULD MISS THE
CHANCE WHICH FORTUNE HAD THROWN IN MY WAY
THE SUN WAS ALREADY SINKING WHEN I REACHED THE SUMMIT OF THE HILL
AND THE LONG SLOPES BENEATH ME WERE ALL GOLDENGREEN ON ONE SIDE AND
GRAY SHADOW ON THE OTHER A HAZE LAY LOW UPON THE FARTHEST SKYLINE
OUT OF WHICH JUTTED THE FANTASTIC SHAPES OF BELLIVER AND VIXEN TOR
OVER THE WIDE EXPANSE THERE WAS NO SOUND AND NO MOVEMENT ONE GREAT
GRAY BIRD A GULL OR CURLEW SOARED ALOFT IN THE BLUE HEAVEN HE AND
I SEEMED TO BE THE ONLY LIVING THINGS BETWEEN THE HUGE ARCH OF THE
SKY AND THE DESERT BENEATH IT THE BARREN SCENE THE SENSE OF
LONELINESS AND THE MYSTERY AND URGENCY OF MY TASK ALL STRUCK A CHILL
INTO MY HEART THE BOY WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN BUT DOWN BENEATH ME IN
A CLEFT OF THE HILLS THERE WAS A CIRCLE OF THE OLD STONE HUTS AND IN
THE MIDDLE OF THEM THERE WAS ONE WHICH RETAINED SUFFICIENT ROOF TO
ACT AS A SCREEN AGAINST THE WEATHER MY HEART LEAPED WITHIN ME AS I
SAW IT THIS MUST BE THE BURROW WHERE THE STRANGER LURKED AT LAST MY
FOOT WAS ON THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HIDING PLACEHIS SECRET WAS WITHIN
MY GRASP
AS I APPROACHED THE HUT WALKING AS WARILY AS STAPLETON WOULD DO WHEN
WITH POISED NET HE DREW NEAR THE SETTLED BUTTERFLY I SATISFIED
MYSELF THAT THE PLACE HAD INDEED BEEN USED AS A HABITATION A VAGUE
PATHWAY AMONG THE BOULDERS LED TO THE DILAPIDATED OPENING WHICH
SERVED AS A DOOR ALL WAS SILENT WITHIN THE UNKNOWN MIGHT BE LURKING
THERE OR HE MIGHT BE PROWLING ON THE MOOR MY NERVES TINGLED WITH
THE SENSE OF ADVENTURE THROWING ASIDE MY CIGARETTE I CLOSED MY HAND
UPON THE BUTT OF MY REVOLVER AND WALKING SWIFTLY UP TO THE DOOR I
LOOKED IN THE PLACE WAS EMPTY
BUT THERE WERE AMPLE SIGNS THAT I HAD NOT COME UPON A FALSE SCENT
THIS WAS CERTAINLY WHERE THE MAN LIVED SOME BLANKETS ROLLED IN A
WATERPROOF LAY UPON THAT VERY STONE SLAB UPON WHICH NEOLITHIC MAN HAD
ONCE SLUMBERED THE ASHES OF A FIRE WERE HEAPED IN A RUDE GRATE
BESIDE IT LAY SOME COOKING UTENSILS AND A BUCKET HALFFULL OF WATER
A LITTER OF EMPTY TINS SHOWED THAT THE PLACE HAD BEEN OCCUPIED FOR
SOME TIME AND I SAW AS MY EYES BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE CHECKERED
LIGHT A PANNIKIN AND A HALFFULL BOTTLE OF SPIRITS STANDING IN THE
CORNER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HUT A FLAT STONE SERVED THE PURPOSE OF A
TABLE AND UPON THIS STOOD A SMALL CLOTH BUNDLETHE SAME NO DOUBT
WHICH I HAD SEEN THROUGH THE TELESCOPE UPON THE SHOULDER OF THE BOY
IT CONTAINED A LOAF OF BREAD A TINNED TONGUE AND TWO TINS OF
PRESERVED PEACHES AS I SET IT DOWN AGAIN AFTER HAVING EXAMINED IT
MY HEART LEAPED TO SEE THAT BENEATH IT THERE LAY A SHEET OF PAPER
WITH WRITING UPON IT I RAISED IT AND THIS WAS WHAT I READ ROUGHLY
SCRAWLED IN PENCIL
DR WATSON HAS GONE TO COOMBE TRACEY
FOR A MINUTE I STOOD THERE WITH THE PAPER IN MY HANDS THINKING OUT
THE MEANING OF THIS CURT MESSAGE IT WAS I THEN AND NOT SIR HENRY
WHO WAS BEING DOGGED BY THIS SECRET MAN HE HAD NOT FOLLOWED ME
HIMSELF BUT HE HAD SET AN AGENTTHE BOY PERHAPSUPON MY TRACK
AND THIS WAS HIS REPORT POSSIBLY I HAD TAKEN NO STEP SINCE I HAD
BEEN UPON THE MOOR WHICH HAD NOT BEEN OBSERVED AND REPORTED ALWAYS
THERE WAS THIS FEELING OF AN UNSEEN FORCE A FINE NET DRAWN ROUND US
WITH INFINITE SKILL AND DELICACY HOLDING US SO LIGHTLY THAT IT WAS
ONLY AT SOME SUPREME MOMENT THAT ONE REALIZED THAT ONE WAS INDEED
ENTANGLED IN ITS MESHES
IF THERE WAS ONE REPORT THERE MIGHT BE OTHERS SO I LOOKED ROUND THE
HUT IN SEARCH OF THEM THERE WAS NO TRACE HOWEVER OF ANYTHING OF
THE KIND NOR COULD I DISCOVER ANY SIGN WHICH MIGHT INDICATE THE
CHARACTER OR INTENTIONS OF THE MAN WHO LIVED IN THIS SINGULAR PLACE
SAVE THAT HE MUST BE OF SPARTAN HABITS AND CARED LITTLE FOR THE
COMFORTS OF LIFE WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE HEAVY RAINS AND LOOKED AT THE
GAPING ROOF I UNDERSTOOD HOW STRONG AND IMMUTABLE MUST BE THE PURPOSE
WHICH HAD KEPT HIM IN THAT INHOSPITABLE ABODE WAS HE OUR MALIGNANT
ENEMY OR WAS HE BY CHANCE OUR GUARDIAN ANGEL I SWORE THAT I WOULD
NOT LEAVE THE HUT UNTIL I KNEW
OUTSIDE THE SUN WAS SINKING LOW AND THE WEST WAS BLAZING WITH SCARLET
AND GOLD ITS REFLECTION WAS SHOT BACK IN RUDDY PATCHES BY THE
DISTANT POOLS WHICH LAY AMID THE GREAT GRIMPEN MIRE THERE WERE THE
TWO TOWERS OF BASKERVILLE HALL AND THERE A DISTANT BLUR OF SMOKE
WHICH MARKED THE VILLAGE OF GRIMPEN BETWEEN THE TWO BEHIND THE
HILL WAS THE HOUSE OF THE STAPLETONS ALL WAS SWEET AND MELLOW AND
PEACEFUL IN THE GOLDEN EVENING LIGHT AND YET AS I LOOKED AT THEM MY
SOUL SHARED NONE OF THE PEACE OF NATURE BUT QUIVERED AT THE VAGUENESS
AND THE TERROR OF THAT INTERVIEW WHICH EVERY INSTANT WAS BRINGING
NEARER WITH TINGLING NERVES BUT A FIXED PURPOSE I SAT IN THE DARK
RECESS OF THE HUT AND WAITED WITH SOMBRE PATIENCE FOR THE COMING OF
ITS TENANT
AND THEN AT LAST I HEARD HIM FAR AWAY CAME THE SHARP CLINK OF A BOOT
STRIKING UPON A STONE THEN ANOTHER AND YET ANOTHER COMING NEARER
AND NEARER I SHRANK BACK INTO THE DARKEST CORNER AND COCKED THE
PISTOL IN MY POCKET DETERMINED NOT TO DISCOVER MYSELF UNTIL I HAD AN
OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING SOMETHING OF THE STRANGER THERE WAS A LONG
PAUSE WHICH SHOWED THAT HE HAD STOPPED THEN ONCE MORE THE FOOTSTEPS
APPROACHED AND A SHADOW FELL ACROSS THE OPENING OF THE HUT
IT IS A LOVELY EVENING MY DEAR WATSON SAID A WELLKNOWN VOICE I
REALLY THINK THAT YOU WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE OUTSIDE THAN IN
CHAPTER XII
DEATH ON THE MOOR
FOR A MOMENT OR TWO I SAT BREATHLESS HARDLY ABLE TO BELIEVE MY EARS
THEN MY SENSES AND MY VOICE CAME BACK TO ME WHILE A CRUSHING WEIGHT
OF RESPONSIBILITY SEEMED IN AN INSTANT TO BE LIFTED FROM MY SOUL
THAT COLD INCISIVE IRONICAL VOICE COULD BELONG TO BUT ONE MAN IN
ALL THE WORLD
HOLMES I CRIEDHOLMES
COME OUT SAID HE AND PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH THE REVOLVER
I STOOPED UNDER THE RUDE LINTEL AND THERE HE SAT UPON A STONE
OUTSIDE HIS GRAY EYES DANCING WITH AMUSEMENT AS THEY FELL UPON MY
ASTONISHED FEATURES HE WAS THIN AND WORN BUT CLEAR AND ALERT HIS
KEEN FACE BRONZED BY THE SUN AND ROUGHENED BY THE WIND IN HIS TWEED
SUIT AND CLOTH CAP HE LOOKED LIKE ANY OTHER TOURIST UPON THE MOOR
AND HE HAD CONTRIVED WITH THAT CATLIKE LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS
WHICH WAS ONE OF HIS CHARACTERISTICS THAT HIS CHIN SHOULD BE AS
SMOOTH AND HIS LINEN AS PERFECT AS IF HE WERE IN BAKER STREET
I NEVER WAS MORE GLAD TO SEE ANYONE IN MY LIFE SAID I AS I WRUNG
HIM BY THE HAND
OR MORE ASTONISHED EH
WELL I MUST CONFESS TO IT
THE SURPRISE WAS NOT ALL ON ONE SIDE I ASSURE YOU I HAD NO IDEA
THAT YOU HAD FOUND MY OCCASIONAL RETREAT STILL LESS THAT YOU WERE
INSIDE IT UNTIL I WAS WITHIN TWENTY PACES OF THE DOOR
MY FOOTPRINT I PRESUME
NO WATSON I FEAR THAT I COULD NOT UNDERTAKE TO RECOGNIZE YOUR
FOOTPRINT AMID ALL THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE WORLD IF YOU SERIOUSLY
DESIRE TO DECEIVE ME YOU MUST CHANGE YOUR TOBACCONIST FOR WHEN I SEE
THE STUB OF A CIGARETTE MARKED BRADLEY OXFORD STREET I KNOW THAT MY
FRIEND WATSON IS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD YOU WILL SEE IT THERE BESIDE
THE PATH YOU THREW IT DOWN NO DOUBT AT THAT SUPREME MOMENT WHEN
YOU CHARGED INTO THE EMPTY HUT
EXACTLY
I THOUGHT AS MUCHAND KNOWING YOUR ADMIRABLE TENACITY I WAS
CONVINCED THAT YOU WERE SITTING IN AMBUSH A WEAPON WITHIN REACH
WAITING FOR THE TENANT TO RETURN SO YOU ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT I WAS
THE CRIMINAL
I DID NOT KNOW WHO YOU WERE BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO FIND OUT
EXCELLENT WATSON AND HOW DID YOU LOCALIZE ME YOU SAW ME PERHAPS
ON THE NIGHT OF THE CONVICT HUNT WHEN I WAS SO IMPRUDENT AS TO ALLOW
THE MOON TO RISE BEHIND ME
YES I SAW YOU THEN
AND HAVE NO DOUBT SEARCHED ALL THE HUTS UNTIL YOU CAME TO THIS ONE
NO YOUR BOY HAD BEEN OBSERVED AND THAT GAVE ME A GUIDE WHERE TO
LOOK
THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE TELESCOPE NO DOUBT I COULD NOT MAKE IT
OUT WHEN FIRST I SAW THE LIGHT FLASHING UPON THE LENS HE ROSE AND
PEEPED INTO THE HUT HA I SEE THAT CARTWRIGHT HAS BROUGHT UP SOME
SUPPLIES WHATS THIS PAPER SO YOU HAVE BEEN TO COOMBE TRACEY HAVE
YOU
YES
TO SEE MRS LAURA LYONS
EXACTLY
WELL DONE OUR RESEARCHES HAVE EVIDENTLY BEEN RUNNING ON PARALLEL
LINES AND WHEN WE UNITE OUR RESULTS I EXPECT WE SHALL HAVE A FAIRLY
FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE CASE
WELL I AM GLAD FROM MY HEART THAT YOU ARE HERE FOR INDEED THE
RESPONSIBILITY AND THE MYSTERY WERE BOTH BECOMING TOO MUCH FOR MY
NERVES BUT HOW IN THE NAME OF WONDER DID YOU COME HERE AND WHAT
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE IN BAKER STREET WORKING
OUT THAT CASE OF BLACKMAILING
THAT WAS WHAT I WISHED YOU TO THINK
THEN YOU USE ME AND YET DO NOT TRUST ME I CRIED WITH SOME
BITTERNESS I THINK THAT I HAVE DESERVED BETTER AT YOUR HANDS
HOLMES
MY DEAR FELLOW YOU HAVE BEEN INVALUABLE TO ME IN THIS AS IN MANY
OTHER CASES AND I BEG THAT YOU WILL FORGIVE ME IF I HAVE SEEMED TO
PLAY A TRICK UPON YOU IN TRUTH IT WAS PARTLY FOR YOUR OWN SAKE THAT
I DID IT AND IT WAS MY APPRECIATION OF THE DANGER WHICH YOU RAN
WHICH LED ME TO COME DOWN AND EXAMINE THE MATTER FOR MYSELF HAD I
BEEN WITH SIR HENRY AND YOU IT IS CONFIDENT THAT MY POINT OF VIEW
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME AS YOURS AND MY PRESENCE WOULD HAVE WARNED
OUR VERY FORMIDABLE OPPONENTS TO BE ON THEIR GUARD AS IT IS I HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO GET ABOUT AS I COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE DONE HAD I BEEN
LIVING IN THE HALL AND I REMAIN AN UNKNOWN FACTOR IN THE BUSINESS
READY TO THROW IN ALL MY WEIGHT AT A CRITICAL MOMENT
BUT WHY KEEP ME IN THE DARK
FOR YOU TO KNOW COULD NOT HAVE HELPED US AND MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE
LED TO MY DISCOVERY YOU WOULD HAVE WISHED TO TELL ME SOMETHING OR
IN YOUR KINDNESS YOU WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME OUT SOME COMFORT OR OTHER
AND SO AN UNNECESSARY RISK WOULD BE RUN I BROUGHT CARTWRIGHT DOWN
WITH MEYOU REMEMBER THE LITTLE CHAP AT THE EXPRESS OFFICEAND HE
HAS SEEN AFTER MY SIMPLE WANTS A LOAF OF BREAD AND A CLEAN COLLAR
WHAT DOES MAN WANT MORE HE HAS GIVEN ME AN EXTRA PAIR OF EYES UPON A
VERY ACTIVE PAIR OF FEET AND BOTH HAVE BEEN INVALUABLE
THEN MY REPORTS HAVE ALL BEEN WASTEDMY VOICE TREMBLED AS I
RECALLED THE PAINS AND THE PRIDE WITH WHICH I HAD COMPOSED THEM
HOLMES TOOK A BUNDLE OF PAPERS FROM HIS POCKET
HERE ARE YOUR REPORTS MY DEAR FELLOW AND VERY WELL THUMBED I
ASSURE YOU I MADE EXCELLENT ARRANGEMENTS AND THEY ARE ONLY DELAYED
ONE DAY UPON THEIR WAY I MUST COMPLIMENT YOU EXCEEDINGLY UPON THE
ZEAL AND THE INTELLIGENCE WHICH YOU HAVE SHOWN OVER AN
EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT CASE
I WAS STILL RATHER RAW OVER THE DECEPTION WHICH HAD BEEN PRACTISED
UPON ME BUT THE WARMTH OF HOLMESS PRAISE DROVE MY ANGER FROM MY
MIND I FELT ALSO IN MY HEART THAT HE WAS RIGHT IN WHAT HE SAID AND
THAT IT WAS REALLY BEST FOR OUR PURPOSE THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN
THAT HE WAS UPON THE MOOR
THATS BETTER SAID HE SEEING THE SHADOW RISE FROM MY FACE AND
NOW TELL ME THE RESULT OF YOUR VISIT TO MRS LAURA LYONSIT WAS NOT
DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GUESS THAT IT WAS TO SEE HER THAT YOU HAD GONE
FOR I AM ALREADY AWARE THAT SHE IS THE ONE PERSON IN COOMBE TRACEY
WHO MIGHT BE OF SERVICE TO US IN THE MATTER IN FACT IF YOU HAD NOT
GONE TODAY IT IS EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE THAT I SHOULD HAVE GONE
TOMORROW
THE SUN HAD SET AND DUSK WAS SETTLING OVER THE MOOR THE AIR HAD
TURNED CHILL AND WE WITHDREW INTO THE HUT FOR WARMTH THERE SITTING
TOGETHER IN THE TWILIGHT I TOLD HOLMES OF MY CONVERSATION WITH THE
LADY SO INTERESTED WAS HE THAT I HAD TO REPEAT SOME OF IT TWICE
BEFORE HE WAS SATISFIED
THIS IS MOST IMPORTANT SAID HE WHEN I HAD CONCLUDED IT FILLS UP
A GAP WHICH I HAD BEEN UNABLE TO BRIDGE IN THIS MOST COMPLEX AFFAIR
YOU ARE AWARE PERHAPS THAT A CLOSE INTIMACY EXISTS BETWEEN THIS
LADY AND THE MAN STAPLETON
I DID NOT KNOW OF A CLOSE INTIMACY
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE MATTER THEY MEET THEY WRITE THERE
IS A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEM NOW THIS PUTS A VERY
POWERFUL WEAPON INTO OUR HANDS IF I COULD ONLY USE IT TO DETACH HIS
WIFE
HIS WIFE
I AM GIVING YOU SOME INFORMATION NOW IN RETURN FOR ALL THAT YOU
HAVE GIVEN ME THE LADY WHO HAS PASSED HERE AS MISS STAPLETON IS IN
REALITY HIS WIFE
GOOD HEAVENS HOLMES ARE YOU SURE OF WHAT YOU SAY HOW COULD HE
HAVE PERMITTED SIR HENRY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER
SIR HENRYS FALLING IN LOVE COULD DO NO HARM TO ANYONE EXCEPT SIR
HENRY HE TOOK PARTICULAR CARE THAT SIR HENRY DID NOT MAKE LOVE TO
HER AS YOU HAVE YOURSELF OBSERVED I REPEAT THAT THE LADY IS HIS
WIFE AND NOT HIS SISTER
BUT WHY THIS ELABORATE DECEPTION
BECAUSE HE FORESAW THAT SHE WOULD BE VERY MUCH MORE USEFUL TO HIM IN
THE CHARACTER OF A FREE WOMAN
ALL MY UNSPOKEN INSTINCTS MY VAGUE SUSPICIONS SUDDENLY TOOK SHAPE
AND CENTRED UPON THE NATURALIST IN THAT IMPASSIVE COLOURLESS MAN
WITH HIS STRAW HAT AND HIS BUTTERFLYNET I SEEMED TO SEE SOMETHING
TERRIBLEA CREATURE OF INFINITE PATIENCE AND CRAFT WITH A SMILING
FACE AND A MURDEROUS HEART
IT IS HE THEN WHO IS OUR ENEMYIT IS HE WHO DOGGED US IN LONDON
SO I READ THE RIDDLE
AND THE WARNINGIT MUST HAVE COME FROM HER
EXACTLY
THE SHAPE OF SOME MONSTROUS VILLAINY HALF SEEN HALF GUESSED LOOMED
THROUGH THE DARKNESS WHICH HAD GIRT ME SO LONG
BUT ARE YOU SURE OF THIS HOLMES HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THE WOMAN IS
HIS WIFE
BECAUSE HE SO FAR FORGOT HIMSELF AS TO TELL YOU A TRUE PIECE OF
AUTOBIOGRAPHY UPON THE OCCASION WHEN HE FIRST MET YOU AND I DARE SAY
HE HAS MANY A TIME REGRETTED IT SINCE HE WAS ONCE A SCHOOLMASTER IN
THE NORTH OF ENGLAND NOW THERE IS NO ONE MORE EASY TO TRACE THAN A
SCHOOLMASTER THERE ARE SCHOLASTIC AGENCIES BY WHICH ONE MAY IDENTIFY
ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN IN THE PROFESSION A LITTLE INVESTIGATION SHOWED
ME THAT A SCHOOL HAD COME TO GRIEF UNDER ATROCIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES AND
THAT THE MAN WHO HAD OWNED ITTHE NAME WAS DIFFERENTHAD
DISAPPEARED WITH HIS WIFE THE DESCRIPTIONS AGREED WHEN I LEARNED
THAT THE MISSING MAN WAS DEVOTED TO ENTOMOLOGY THE IDENTIFICATION WAS
COMPLETE
THE DARKNESS WAS RISING BUT MUCH WAS STILL HIDDEN BY THE SHADOWS
IF THIS WOMAN IS IN TRUTH HIS WIFE WHERE DOES MRS LAURA LYONS COME
IN I ASKED
THAT IS ONE OF THE POINTS UPON WHICH YOUR OWN RESEARCHES HAVE SHED A
LIGHT YOUR INTERVIEW WITH THE LADY HAS CLEARED THE SITUATION VERY
MUCH I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT A PROJECTED DIVORCE BETWEEN HERSELF AND
HER HUSBAND IN THAT CASE REGARDING STAPLETON AS AN UNMARRIED MAN
SHE COUNTED NO DOUBT UPON BECOMING HIS WIFE
AND WHEN SHE IS UNDECEIVED
WHY THEN WE MAY FIND THE LADY OF SERVICE IT MUST BE OUR FIRST DUTY
TO SEE HERBOTH OF USTOMORROW DONT YOU THINK WATSON THAT YOU
ARE AWAY FROM YOUR CHARGE RATHER LONG YOUR PLACE SHOULD BE AT
BASKERVILLE HALL
THE LAST RED STREAKS HAD FADED AWAY IN THE WEST AND NIGHT HAD SETTLED
UPON THE MOOR A FEW FAINT STARS WERE GLEAMING IN A VIOLET SKY
ONE LAST QUESTION HOLMES I SAID AS I ROSE SURELY THERE IS NO
NEED OF SECRECY BETWEEN YOU AND ME WHAT IS THE MEANING OF IT ALL
WHAT IS HE AFTER
HOLMESS VOICE SANK AS HE ANSWERED
IT IS MURDER WATSONREFINED COLDBLOODED DELIBERATE MURDER DO
NOT ASK ME FOR PARTICULARS MY NETS ARE CLOSING UPON HIM EVEN AS HIS
ARE UPON SIR HENRY AND WITH YOUR HELP HE IS ALREADY ALMOST AT MY
MERCY THERE IS BUT ONE DANGER WHICH CAN THREATEN US IT IS THAT HE
SHOULD STRIKE BEFORE WE ARE READY TO DO SO ANOTHER DAYTWO AT THE
MOSTAND I HAVE MY CASE COMPLETE BUT UNTIL THEN GUARD YOUR CHARGE
AS CLOSELY AS EVER A FOND MOTHER WATCHED HER AILING CHILD YOUR
MISSION TODAY HAS JUSTIFIED ITSELF AND YET I COULD ALMOST WISH THAT
YOU HAD NOT LEFT HIS SIDE HARK
A TERRIBLE SCREAMA PROLONGED YELL OF HORROR AND ANGUISHBURST OUT
OF THE SILENCE OF THE MOOR THAT FRIGHTFUL CRY TURNED THE BLOOD TO
ICE IN MY VEINS
OH MY GOD I GASPED WHAT IS IT WHAT DOES IT MEAN
HOLMES HAD SPRUNG TO HIS FEET AND I SAW HIS DARK ATHLETIC OUTLINE
AT THE DOOR OF THE HUT HIS SHOULDERS STOOPING HIS HEAD THRUST
FORWARD HIS FACE PEERING INTO THE DARKNESS
HUSH HE WHISPERED HUSH
THE CRY HAD BEEN LOUD ON ACCOUNT OF ITS VEHEMENCE BUT IT HAD PEALED
OUT FROM SOMEWHERE FAR OFF ON THE SHADOWY PLAIN NOW IT BURST UPON
OUR EARS NEARER LOUDER MORE URGENT THAN BEFORE
WHERE IS IT HOLMES WHISPERED AND I KNEW FROM THE THRILL OF HIS
VOICE THAT HE THE MAN OF IRON WAS SHAKEN TO THE SOUL WHERE IS IT
WATSON
THERE I THINK I POINTED INTO THE DARKNESS
NO THERE
AGAIN THE AGONIZED CRY SWEPT THROUGH THE SILENT NIGHT LOUDER AND
MUCH NEARER THAN EVER AND A NEW SOUND MINGLED WITH IT A DEEP
MUTTERED RUMBLE MUSICAL AND YET MENACING RISING AND FALLING LIKE
THE LOW CONSTANT MURMUR OF THE SEA
THE HOUND CRIED HOLMES COME WATSON COME GREAT HEAVENS IF WE
ARE TOO LATE
HE HAD STARTED RUNNING SWIFTLY OVER THE MOOR AND I HAD FOLLOWED AT
HIS HEELS BUT NOW FROM SOMEWHERE AMONG THE BROKEN GROUND IMMEDIATELY
IN FRONT OF US THERE CAME ONE LAST DESPAIRING YELL AND THEN A DULL
HEAVY THUD WE HALTED AND LISTENED NOT ANOTHER SOUND BROKE THE HEAVY
SILENCE OF THE WINDLESS NIGHT
I SAW HOLMES PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MAN DISTRACTED HE
STAMPED HIS FEET UPON THE GROUND
HE HAS BEATEN US WATSON WE ARE TOO LATE
NO NO SURELY NOT
FOOL THAT I WAS TO HOLD MY HAND AND YOU WATSON SEE WHAT COMES OF
ABANDONING YOUR CHARGE BUT BY HEAVEN IF THE WORST HAS HAPPENED
WELL AVENGE HIM
BLINDLY WE RAN THROUGH THE GLOOM BLUNDERING AGAINST BOULDERS
FORCING OUR WAY THROUGH GORSE BUSHES PANTING UP HILLS AND RUSHING
DOWN SLOPES HEADING ALWAYS IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE THOSE DREADFUL
SOUNDS HAD COME AT EVERY RISE HOLMES LOOKED EAGERLY ROUND HIM BUT
THE SHADOWS WERE THICK UPON THE MOOR AND NOTHING MOVED UPON ITS
DREARY FACE
CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING
NOTHING
BUT HARK WHAT IS THAT
A LOW MOAN HAD FALLEN UPON OUR EARS THERE IT WAS AGAIN UPON OUR
LEFT ON THAT SIDE A RIDGE OF ROCKS ENDED IN A SHEER CLIFF WHICH
OVERLOOKED A STONESTREWN SLOPE ON ITS JAGGED FACE WAS SPREADEAGLED
SOME DARK IRREGULAR OBJECT AS WE RAN TOWARDS IT THE VAGUE OUTLINE
HARDENED INTO A DEFINITE SHAPE IT WAS A PROSTRATE MAN FACE DOWNWARD
UPON THE GROUND THE HEAD DOUBLED UNDER HIM AT A HORRIBLE ANGLE THE
SHOULDERS ROUNDED AND THE BODY HUNCHED TOGETHER AS IF IN THE ACT OF
THROWING A SOMERSAULT SO GROTESQUE WAS THE ATTITUDE THAT I COULD NOT
FOR THE INSTANT REALIZE THAT THAT MOAN HAD BEEN THE PASSING OF HIS
SOUL NOT A WHISPER NOT A RUSTLE ROSE NOW FROM THE DARK FIGURE OVER
WHICH WE STOOPED HOLMES LAID HIS HAND UPON HIM AND HELD IT UP
AGAIN WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR THE GLEAM OF THE MATCH WHICH HE
STRUCK SHONE UPON HIS CLOTTED FINGERS AND UPON THE GHASTLY POOL WHICH
WIDENED SLOWLY FROM THE CRUSHED SKULL OF THE VICTIM AND IT SHONE
UPON SOMETHING ELSE WHICH TURNED OUR HEARTS SICK AND FAINT WITHIN
USTHE BODY OF SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE
THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF EITHER OF US FORGETTING THAT PECULIAR RUDDY
TWEED SUITTHE VERY ONE WHICH HE HAD WORN ON THE FIRST MORNING THAT
WE HAD SEEN HIM IN BAKER STREET WE CAUGHT THE ONE CLEAR GLIMPSE OF
IT AND THEN THE MATCH FLICKERED AND WENT OUT EVEN AS THE HOPE HAD
GONE OUT OF OUR SOULS HOLMES GROANED AND HIS FACE GLIMMERED WHITE
THROUGH THE DARKNESS
THE BRUTE THE BRUTE I CRIED WITH CLENCHED HANDS OH HOLMES I
SHALL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF FOR HAVING LEFT HIM TO HIS FATE
I AM MORE TO BLAME THAN YOU WATSON IN ORDER TO HAVE MY CASE WELL
ROUNDED AND COMPLETE I HAVE THROWN AWAY THE LIFE OF MY CLIENT IT IS
THE GREATEST BLOW WHICH HAS BEFALLEN ME IN MY CAREER BUT HOW COULD I
KNOWHOW COULD L KNOWTHAT HE WOULD RISK HIS LIFE ALONE UPON THE
MOOR IN THE FACE OF ALL MY WARNINGS
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HEARD HIS SCREAMSMY GOD THOSE SCREAMSAND
YET HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SAVE HIM WHERE IS THIS BRUTE OF A HOUND
WHICH DROVE HIM TO HIS DEATH IT MAY BE LURKING AMONG THESE ROCKS AT
THIS INSTANT AND STAPLETON WHERE IS HE HE SHALL ANSWER FOR THIS
DEED
HE SHALL I WILL SEE TO THAT UNCLE AND NEPHEW HAVE BEEN
MURDEREDTHE ONE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH BY THE VERY SIGHT OF A BEAST
WHICH HE THOUGHT TO BE SUPERNATURAL THE OTHER DRIVEN TO HIS END IN
HIS WILD FLIGHT TO ESCAPE FROM IT BUT NOW WE HAVE TO PROVE THE
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MAN AND THE BEAST SAVE FROM WHAT WE HEARD WE
CANNOT EVEN SWEAR TO THE EXISTENCE OF THE LATTER SINCE SIR HENRY HAS
EVIDENTLY DIED FROM THE FALL BUT BY HEAVENS CUNNING AS HE IS THE
FELLOW SHALL BE IN MY POWER BEFORE ANOTHER DAY IS PAST
WE STOOD WITH BITTER HEARTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MANGLED BODY
OVERWHELMED BY THIS SUDDEN AND IRREVOCABLE DISASTER WHICH HAD BROUGHT
ALL OUR LONG AND WEARY LABOURS TO SO PITEOUS AN END THEN AS THE
MOON ROSE WE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE ROCKS OVER WHICH OUR POOR
FRIEND HAD FALLEN AND FROM THE SUMMIT WE GAZED OUT OVER THE SHADOWY
MOOR HALF SILVER AND HALF GLOOM FAR AWAY MILES OFF IN THE
DIRECTION OF GRIMPEN A SINGLE STEADY YELLOW LIGHT WAS SHINING IT
COULD ONLY COME FROM THE LONELY ABODE OF THE STAPLETONS WITH A
BITTER CURSE I SHOOK MY FIST AT IT AS I GAZED
WHY SHOULD WE NOT SEIZE HIM AT ONCE
OUR CASE IS NOT COMPLETE THE FELLOW IS WARY AND CUNNING TO THE LAST
DEGREE IT IS NOT WHAT WE KNOW BUT WHAT WE CAN PROVE IF WE MAKE ONE
FALSE MOVE THE VILLAIN MAY ESCAPE US YET
WHAT CAN WE DO
THERE WILL BE PLENTY FOR US TO DO TOMORROW TONIGHT WE CAN ONLY
PERFORM THE LAST OFFICES TO OUR POOR FRIEND
TOGETHER WE MADE OUR WAY DOWN THE PRECIPITOUS SLOPE AND APPROACHED
THE BODY BLACK AND CLEAR AGAINST THE SILVERED STONES THE AGONY OF
THOSE CONTORTED LIMBS STRUCK ME WITH A SPASM OF PAIN AND BLURRED MY
EYES WITH TEARS
WE MUST SEND FOR HELP HOLMES WE CANNOT CARRY HIM ALL THE WAY TO
THE HALL GOOD HEAVENS ARE YOU MAD
HE HAD UTTERED A CRY AND BENT OVER THE BODY NOW HE WAS DANCING AND
LAUGHING AND WRINGING MY HAND COULD THIS BE MY STERN SELFCONTAINED
FRIEND THESE WERE HIDDEN FIRES INDEED
A BEARD A BEARD THE MAN HAS A BEARD
A BEARD
IT IS NOT THE BARONETIT ISWHY IT IS MY NEIGHBOUR THE CONVICT
WITH FEVERISH HASTE WE HAD TURNED THE BODY OVER AND THAT DRIPPING
BEARD WAS POINTING UP TO THE COLD CLEAR MOON THERE COULD BE NO
DOUBT ABOUT THE BEETLING FOREHEAD THE SUNKEN ANIMAL EYES IT WAS
INDEED THE SAME FACE WHICH HAD GLARED UPON ME IN THE LIGHT OF THE
CANDLE FROM OVER THE ROCKTHE FACE OF SELDEN THE CRIMINAL
THEN IN AN INSTANT IT WAS ALL CLEAR TO ME I REMEMBERED HOW THE
BARONET HAD TOLD ME THAT HE HAD HANDED HIS OLD WARDROBE TO BARRYMORE
BARRYMORE HAD PASSED IT ON IN ORDER TO HELP SELDEN IN HIS ESCAPE
BOOTS SHIRT CAPIT WAS ALL SIR HENRYS THE TRAGEDY WAS STILL
BLACK ENOUGH BUT THIS MAN HAD AT LEAST DESERVED DEATH BY THE LAWS OF
HIS COUNTRY I TOLD HOLMES HOW THE MATTER STOOD MY HEART BUBBLING
OVER WITH THANKFULNESS AND JOY
THEN THE CLOTHES HAVE BEEN THE POOR DEVILS DEATH SAID HE IT IS
CLEAR ENOUGH THAT THE HOUND HAS BEEN LAID ON FROM SOME ARTICLE OF SIR
HENRYSTHE BOOT WHICH WAS ABSTRACTED IN THE HOTEL IN ALL
PROBABILITYAND SO RAN THIS MAN DOWN THERE IS ONE VERY SINGULAR
THING HOWEVER HOW CAME SELDEN IN THE DARKNESS TO KNOW THAT THE
HOUND WAS ON HIS TRAIL
HE HEARD HIM
TO HEAR A HOUND UPON THE MOOR WOULD NOT WORK A HARD MAN LIKE THIS
CONVICT INTO SUCH A PAROXYSM OF TERROR THAT HE WOULD RISK RECAPTURE
BY SCREAMING WILDLY FOR HELP BY HIS CRIES HE MUST HAVE RUN A LONG
WAY AFTER HE KNEW THE ANIMAL WAS ON HIS TRACK HOW DID HE KNOW
A GREATER MYSTERY TO ME IS WHY THIS HOUND PRESUMING THAT ALL OUR
CONJECTURES ARE CORRECT
I PRESUME NOTHING
WELL THEN WHY THIS HOUND SHOULD BE LOOSE TONIGHT I SUPPOSE THAT
IT DOES NOT ALWAYS RUN LOOSE UPON THE MOOR STAPLETON WOULD NOT LET
IT GO UNLESS HE HAD REASON TO THINK THAT SIR HENRY WOULD BE THERE
MY DIFFICULTY IS THE MORE FORMIDABLE OF THE TWO FOR I THINK THAT WE
SHALL VERY SHORTLY GET AN EXPLANATION OF YOURS WHILE MINE MAY REMAIN
FOREVER A MYSTERY THE QUESTION NOW IS WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THIS
POOR WRETCHS BODY WE CANNOT LEAVE IT HERE TO THE FOXES AND THE
RAVENS
I SUGGEST THAT WE PUT IT IN ONE OF THE HUTS UNTIL WE CAN COMMUNICATE
WITH THE POLICE
EXACTLY I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU AND I COULD CARRY IT SO FAR
HALLOA WATSON WHATS THIS ITS THE MAN HIMSELF BY ALL THATS
WONDERFUL AND AUDACIOUS NOT A WORD TO SHOW YOUR SUSPICIONSNOT A
WORD OR MY PLANS CRUMBLE TO THE GROUND
A FIGURE WAS APPROACHING US OVER THE MOOR AND I SAW THE DULL RED
GLOW OF A CIGAR THE MOON SHONE UPON HIM AND I COULD DISTINGUISH THE
DAPPER SHAPE AND JAUNTY WALK OF THE NATURALIST HE STOPPED WHEN HE
SAW US AND THEN CAME ON AGAIN
WHY DR WATSON THATS NOT YOU IS IT YOU ARE THE LAST MAN THAT I
SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE OUT ON THE MOOR AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT
BUT DEAR ME WHATS THIS SOMEBODY HURT NOTDONT TELL ME THAT IT
IS OUR FRIEND SIR HENRY HE HURRIED PAST ME AND STOOPED OVER THE
DEAD MAN I HEARD A SHARP INTAKE OF HIS BREATH AND THE CIGAR FELL
FROM HIS FINGERS
WHOWHOS THIS HE STAMMERED
IT IS SELDEN THE MAN WHO ESCAPED FROM PRINCETOWN
STAPLETON TURNED A GHASTLY FACE UPON US BUT BY A SUPREME EFFORT HE
HAD OVERCOME HIS AMAZEMENT AND HIS DISAPPOINTMENT HE LOOKED SHARPLY
FROM HOLMES TO ME
DEAR ME WHAT A VERY SHOCKING AFFAIR HOW DID HE DIE
HE APPEARS TO HAVE BROKEN HIS NECK BY FALLING OVER THESE ROCKS MY
FRIEND AND I WERE STROLLING ON THE MOOR WHEN WE HEARD A CRY
I HEARD A CRY ALSO THAT WAS WHAT BROUGHT ME OUT I WAS UNEASY ABOUT
SIR HENRY
WHY ABOUT SIR HENRY IN PARTICULAR I COULD NOT HELP ASKING
BECAUSE I HAD SUGGESTED THAT HE SHOULD COME OVER WHEN HE DID NOT
COME I WAS SURPRISED AND I NATURALLY BECAME ALARMED FOR HIS SAFETY
WHEN I HEARD CRIES UPON THE MOOR BY THE WAYHIS EYES DARTED AGAIN
FROM MY FACE TO HOLMESSDID YOU HEAR ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES A CRY
NO SAID HOLMES DID YOU
NO
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEN
OH YOU KNOW THE STORIES THAT THE PEASANTS TELL ABOUT A PHANTOM
HOUND AND SO ON IT IS SAID TO BE HEARD AT NIGHT UPON THE MOOR I
WAS WONDERING IF THERE WERE ANY EVIDENCE OF SUCH A SOUND TONIGHT
WE HEARD NOTHING OF THE KIND SAID I
AND WHAT IS YOUR THEORY OF THIS POOR FELLOWS DEATH
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT ANXIETY AND EXPOSURE HAVE DRIVEN HIM OFF HIS
HEAD HE HAS RUSHED ABOUT THE MOOR IN A CRAZY STATE AND EVENTUALLY
FALLEN OVER HERE AND BROKEN HIS NECK
THAT SEEMS THE MOST REASONABLE THEORY SAID STAPLETON AND HE GAVE
A SIGH WHICH I TOOK TO INDICATE HIS RELIEF WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
IT MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
MY FRIEND BOWED HIS COMPLIMENTS
YOU ARE QUICK AT IDENTIFICATION SAID HE
WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING YOU IN THESE PARTS SINCE DR WATSON CAME
DOWN YOU ARE IN TIME TO SEE A TRAGEDY
YES INDEED I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT MY FRIENDS EXPLANATION WILL COVER
THE FACTS I WILL TAKE AN UNPLEASANT REMEMBRANCE BACK TO LONDON WITH
ME TOMORROW
OH YOU RETURN TOMORROW
THAT IS MY INTENTION
I HOPE YOUR VISIT HAS CAST SOME LIGHT UPON THOSE OCCURRENCES WHICH
HAVE PUZZLED US
HOLMES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
ONE CANNOT ALWAYS HAVE THE SUCCESS FOR WHICH ONE HOPES AN
INVESTIGATOR NEEDS FACTS AND NOT LEGENDS OR RUMOURS IT HAS NOT BEEN
A SATISFACTORY CASE
MY FRIEND SPOKE IN HIS FRANKEST AND MOST UNCONCERNED MANNER
STAPLETON STILL LOOKED HARD AT HIM THEN HE TURNED TO ME
I WOULD SUGGEST CARRYING THIS POOR FELLOW TO MY HOUSE BUT IT WOULD
GIVE MY SISTER SUCH A FRIGHT THAT I DO NOT FEEL JUSTIFIED IN DOING
IT I THINK THAT IF WE PUT SOMETHING OVER HIS FACE HE WILL BE SAFE
UNTIL MORNING
AND SO IT WAS ARRANGED RESISTING STAPLETONS OFFER OF HOSPITALITY
HOLMES AND I SET OFF TO BASKERVILLE HALL LEAVING THE NATURALIST TO
RETURN ALONE LOOKING BACK WE SAW THE FIGURE MOVING SLOWLY AWAY OVER
THE BROAD MOOR AND BEHIND HIM THAT ONE BLACK SMUDGE ON THE SILVERED
SLOPE WHICH SHOWED WHERE THE MAN WAS LYING WHO HAD COME SO HORRIBLY
TO HIS END
CHAPTER XIII
FIXING THE NETS
WERE AT CLOSE GRIPS AT LAST SAID HOLMES AS WE WALKED TOGETHER
ACROSS THE MOOR WHAT A NERVE THE FELLOW HAS HOW HE PULLED HIMSELF
TOGETHER IN THE FACE OF WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN A PARALYZING SHOCK WHEN
HE FOUND THAT THE WRONG MAN HAD FALLEN A VICTIM TO HIS PLOT I TOLD
YOU IN LONDON WATSON AND I TELL YOU NOW AGAIN THAT WE HAVE NEVER
HAD A FOEMAN MORE WORTHY OF OUR STEEL
I AM SORRY THAT HE HAS SEEN YOU
AND SO WAS I AT FIRST BUT THERE WAS NO GETTING OUT OF IT
WHAT EFFECT DO YOU THINK IT WILL HAVE UPON HIS PLANS NOW THAT HE
KNOWS YOU ARE HERE
IT MAY CAUSE HIM TO BE MORE CAUTIOUS OR IT MAY DRIVE HIM TO
DESPERATE MEASURES AT ONCE LIKE MOST CLEVER CRIMINALS HE MAY BE TOO
CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN CLEVERNESS AND IMAGINE THAT HE HAS COMPLETELY
DECEIVED US
WHY SHOULD WE NOT ARREST HIM AT ONCE
MY DEAR WATSON YOU WERE BORN TO BE A MAN OF ACTION YOUR INSTINCT
IS ALWAYS TO DO SOMETHING ENERGETIC BUT SUPPOSING FOR ARGUMENTS
SAKE THAT WE HAD HIM ARRESTED TONIGHT WHAT ON EARTH THE BETTER OFF
SHOULD WE BE FOR THAT WE COULD PROVE NOTHING AGAINST HIM THERES
THE DEVILISH CUNNING OF IT IF HE WERE ACTING THROUGH A HUMAN AGENT
WE COULD GET SOME EVIDENCE BUT IF WE WERE TO DRAG THIS GREAT DOG TO
THE LIGHT OF DAY IT WOULD NOT HELP US IN PUTTING A ROPE ROUND THE
NECK OF ITS MASTER
SURELY WE HAVE A CASE
NOT A SHADOW OF ONEONLY SURMISE AND CONJECTURE WE SHOULD BE
LAUGHED OUT OF COURT IF WE CAME WITH SUCH A STORY AND SUCH EVIDENCE
THERE IS SIR CHARLESS DEATH
FOUND DEAD WITHOUT A MARK UPON HIM YOU AND I KNOW THAT HE DIED OF
SHEER FRIGHT AND WE KNOW ALSO WHAT FRIGHTENED HIM BUT HOW ARE WE TO
GET TWELVE STOLID JURYMEN TO KNOW IT WHAT SIGNS ARE THERE OF A
HOUND WHERE ARE THE MARKS OF ITS FANGS OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT A
HOUND DOES NOT BITE A DEAD BODY AND THAT SIR CHARLES WAS DEAD BEFORE
EVER THE BRUTE OVERTOOK HIM BUT WE HAVE TO PROVE ALL THIS AND WE
ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO DO IT
WELL THEN TONIGHT
WE ARE NOT MUCH BETTER OFF TONIGHT AGAIN THERE WAS NO DIRECT
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE HOUND AND THE MANS DEATH WE NEVER SAW THE
HOUND WE HEARD IT BUT WE COULD NOT PROVE THAT IT WAS RUNNING UPON
THIS MANS TRAIL THERE IS A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF MOTIVE NO MY DEAR
FELLOW WE MUST RECONCILE OURSELVES TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NO CASE
AT PRESENT AND THAT IT IS WORTH OUR WHILE TO RUN ANY RISK IN ORDER
TO ESTABLISH ONE
AND HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO SO
I HAVE GREAT HOPES OF WHAT MRS LAURA LYONS MAY DO FOR US WHEN THE
POSITION OF AFFAIRS IS MADE CLEAR TO HER AND I HAVE MY OWN PLAN AS
WELL SUFFICIENT FOR TOMORROW IS THE EVIL THEREOF BUT I HOPE BEFORE
THE DAY IS PAST TO HAVE THE UPPER HAND AT LAST
I COULD DRAW NOTHING FURTHER FROM HIM AND HE WALKED LOST IN
THOUGHT AS FAR AS THE BASKERVILLE GATES
ARE YOU COMING UP
YES I SEE NO REASON FOR FURTHER CONCEALMENT BUT ONE LAST WORD
WATSON SAY NOTHING OF THE HOUND TO SIR HENRY LET HIM THINK THAT
SELDENS DEATH WAS AS STAPLETON WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE HE WILL HAVE A
BETTER NERVE FOR THE ORDEAL WHICH HE WILL HAVE TO UNDERGO TOMORROW
WHEN HE IS ENGAGED IF I REMEMBER YOUR REPORT ARIGHT TO DINE WITH
THESE PEOPLE
AND SO AM I
THEN YOU MUST EXCUSE YOURSELF AND HE MUST GO ALONE THAT WILL BE
EASILY ARRANGED AND NOW IF WE ARE TOO LATE FOR DINNER I THINK THAT
WE ARE BOTH READY FOR OUR SUPPERS
SIR HENRY WAS MORE PLEASED THAN SURPRISED TO SEE SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR
HE HAD FOR SOME DAYS BEEN EXPECTING THAT RECENT EVENTS WOULD BRING
HIM DOWN FROM LONDON HE DID RAISE HIS EYEBROWS HOWEVER WHEN HE
FOUND THAT MY FRIEND HAD NEITHER ANY LUGGAGE NOR ANY EXPLANATIONS FOR
ITS ABSENCE BETWEEN US WE SOON SUPPLIED HIS WANTS AND THEN OVER A
BELATED SUPPER WE EXPLAINED TO THE BARONET AS MUCH OF OUR EXPERIENCE
AS IT SEEMED DESIRABLE THAT HE SHOULD KNOW BUT FIRST I HAD THE
UNPLEASANT DUTY OF BREAKING THE NEWS TO BARRYMORE AND HIS WIFE TO
HIM IT MAY HAVE BEEN AN UNMITIGATED RELIEF BUT SHE WEPT BITTERLY IN
HER APRON TO ALL THE WORLD HE WAS THE MAN OF VIOLENCE HALF ANIMAL
AND HALF DEMON BUT TO HER HE ALWAYS REMAINED THE LITTLE WILFUL BOY
OF HER OWN GIRLHOOD THE CHILD WHO HAD CLUNG TO HER HAND EVIL INDEED
IS THE MAN WHO HAS NOT ONE WOMAN TO MOURN HIM
IVE BEEN MOPING IN THE HOUSE ALL DAY SINCE WATSON WENT OFF IN THE
MORNING SAID THE BARONET I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE SOME CREDIT FOR I
HAVE KEPT MY PROMISE IF I HADNT SWORN NOT TO GO ABOUT ALONE I MIGHT
HAVE HAD A MORE LIVELY EVENING FOR I HAD A MESSAGE FROM STAPLETON
ASKING ME OVER THERE
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A MORE LIVELY EVENING SAID
HOLMES DRILY BY THE WAY I DONT SUPPOSE YOU APPRECIATE THAT WE
HAVE BEEN MOURNING OVER YOU AS HAVING BROKEN YOUR NECK
SIR HENRY OPENED HIS EYES HOW WAS THAT
THIS POOR WRETCH WAS DRESSED IN YOUR CLOTHES I FEAR YOUR SERVANT
WHO GAVE THEM TO HIM MAY GET INTO TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE
THAT IS UNLIKELY THERE WAS NO MARK ON ANY OF THEM AS FAR AS I
KNOW
THATS LUCKY FOR HIMIN FACT ITS LUCKY FOR ALL OF YOU SINCE YOU
ARE ALL ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE LAW IN THIS MATTER I AM NOT SURE
THAT AS A CONSCIENTIOUS DETECTIVE MY FIRST DUTY IS NOT TO ARREST THE
WHOLE HOUSEHOLD WATSONS REPORTS ARE MOST INCRIMINATING DOCUMENTS
BUT HOW ABOUT THE CASE ASKED THE BARONET HAVE YOU MADE ANYTHING
OUT OF THE TANGLE I DONT KNOW THAT WATSON AND I ARE MUCH THE WISER
SINCE WE CAME DOWN
I THINK THAT I SHALL BE IN A POSITION TO MAKE THE SITUATION RATHER
MORE CLEAR TO YOU BEFORE LONG IT HAS BEEN AN EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT
AND MOST COMPLICATED BUSINESS THERE ARE SEVERAL POINTS UPON WHICH WE
STILL WANT LIGHTBUT IT IS COMING ALL THE SAME
WEVE HAD ONE EXPERIENCE AS WATSON HAS NO DOUBT TOLD YOU WE HEARD
THE HOUND ON THE MOOR SO I CAN SWEAR THAT IT IS NOT ALL EMPTY
SUPERSTITION I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH DOGS WHEN I WAS OUT WEST
AND I KNOW ONE WHEN I HEAR ONE IF YOU CAN MUZZLE THAT ONE AND PUT
HIM ON A CHAIN ILL BE READY TO SWEAR YOU ARE THE GREATEST DETECTIVE
OF ALL TIME
I THINK I WILL MUZZLE HIM AND CHAIN HIM ALL RIGHT IF YOU WILL GIVE
ME YOUR HELP
WHATEVER YOU TELL ME TO DO I WILL DO
VERY GOOD AND I WILL ASK YOU ALSO TO DO IT BLINDLY WITHOUT ALWAYS
ASKING THE REASON
JUST AS YOU LIKE
IF YOU WILL DO THIS I THINK THE CHANCES ARE THAT OUR LITTLE PROBLEM
WILL SOON BE SOLVED I HAVE NO DOUBT
HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AND STARED FIXEDLY UP OVER MY HEAD INTO THE AIR
THE LAMP BEAT UPON HIS FACE AND SO INTENT WAS IT AND SO STILL THAT
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT OF A CLEARCUT CLASSICAL STATUE A
PERSONIFICATION OF ALERTNESS AND EXPECTATION
WHAT IS IT WE BOTH CRIED
I COULD SEE AS HE LOOKED DOWN THAT HE WAS REPRESSING SOME INTERNAL
EMOTION HIS FEATURES WERE STILL COMPOSED BUT HIS EYES SHONE WITH
AMUSED EXULTATION
EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR SAID HE AS HE WAVED HIS
HAND TOWARDS THE LINE OF PORTRAITS WHICH COVERED THE OPPOSITE WALL
WATSON WONT ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART BUT THAT IS MERE
JEALOUSY BECAUSE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER NOW THESE ARE A
REALLY VERY FINE SERIES OF PORTRAITS
WELL IM GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY SO SAID SIR HENRY GLANCING WITH
SOME SURPRISE AT MY FRIEND I DONT PRETEND TO KNOW MUCH ABOUT THESE
THINGS AND ID BE A BETTER JUDGE OF A HORSE OR A STEER THAN OF A
PICTURE I DIDNT KNOW THAT YOU FOUND TIME FOR SUCH THINGS
I KNOW WHAT IS GOOD WHEN I SEE IT AND I SEE IT NOW THATS A
KNELLER ILL SWEAR THAT LADY IN THE BLUE SILK OVER YONDER AND THE
STOUT GENTLEMAN WITH THE WIG OUGHT TO BE A REYNOLDS THEY ARE ALL
FAMILY PORTRAITS I PRESUME
EVERY ONE
DO YOU KNOW THE NAMES
BARRYMORE HAS BEEN COACHING ME IN THEM AND I THINK I CAN SAY MY
LESSONS FAIRLY WELL
WHO IS THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE TELESCOPE
THAT IS REARADMIRAL BASKERVILLE WHO SERVED UNDER RODNEY IN THE
WEST INDIES THE MAN WITH THE BLUE COAT AND THE ROLL OF PAPER IS SIR
WILLIAM BASKERVILLE WHO WAS CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE OF
COMMONS UNDER PITT
AND THIS CAVALIER OPPOSITE TO METHE ONE WITH THE BLACK VELVET AND
THE LACE
AH YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT HIM THAT IS THE CAUSE OF ALL THE
MISCHIEF THE WICKED HUGO WHO STARTED THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES
WERE NOT LIKELY TO FORGET HIM
I GAZED WITH INTEREST AND SOME SURPRISE UPON THE PORTRAIT
DEAR ME SAID HOLMES HE SEEMS A QUIET MEEKMANNERED MAN ENOUGH
BUT I DARE SAY THAT THERE WAS A LURKING DEVIL IN HIS EYES I HAD
PICTURED HIM AS A MORE ROBUST AND RUFFIANLY PERSON
THERES NO DOUBT ABOUT THE AUTHENTICITY FOR THE NAME AND THE DATE
ARE ON THE BACK OF THE CANVAS
HOLMES SAID LITTLE MORE BUT THE PICTURE OF THE OLD ROYSTERER SEEMED
TO HAVE A FASCINATION FOR HIM AND HIS EYES WERE CONTINUALLY FIXED
UPON IT DURING SUPPER IT WAS NOT UNTIL LATER WHEN SIR HENRY HAD
GONE TO HIS ROOM THAT I WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW THE TREND OF HIS
THOUGHTS HE LED ME BACK INTO THE BANQUETINGHALL HIS BEDROOM CANDLE
IN HIS HAND AND HE HELD IT UP AGAINST THE TIMESTAINED PORTRAIT ON
THE WALL
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING THERE
I LOOKED AT THE BROAD PLUMED HAT THE CURLING LOVELOCKS THE WHITE
LACE COLLAR AND THE STRAIGHT SEVERE FACE WHICH WAS FRAMED BETWEEN
THEM IT WAS NOT A BRUTAL COUNTENANCE BUT IT WAS PRIM HARD AND
STERN WITH A FIRMSET THINLIPPED MOUTH AND A COLDLY INTOLERANT
EYE
IS IT LIKE ANYONE YOU KNOW
THERE IS SOMETHING OF SIR HENRY ABOUT THE JAW
JUST A SUGGESTION PERHAPS BUT WAIT AN INSTANT HE STOOD UPON A
CHAIR AND HOLDING UP THE LIGHT IN HIS LEFT HAND HE CURVED HIS
RIGHT ARM OVER THE BROAD HAT AND ROUND THE LONG RINGLETS
GOOD HEAVENS I CRIED IN AMAZEMENT
THE FACE OF STAPLETON HAD SPRUNG OUT OF THE CANVAS
HA YOU SEE IT NOW MY EYES HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO EXAMINE FACES AND
NOT THEIR TRIMMINGS IT IS THE FIRST QUALITY OF A CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATOR THAT HE SHOULD SEE THROUGH A DISGUISE
BUT THIS IS MARVELLOUS IT MIGHT BE HIS PORTRAIT
YES IT IS AN INTERESTING INSTANCE OF A THROWBACK WHICH APPEARS TO
BE BOTH PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL A STUDY OF FAMILY PORTRAITS IS ENOUGH
TO CONVERT A MAN TO THE DOCTRINE OF REINCARNATION THE FELLOW IS A
BASKERVILLETHAT IS EVIDENT
WITH DESIGNS UPON THE SUCCESSION
EXACTLY THIS CHANCE OF THE PICTURE HAS SUPPLIED US WITH ONE OF OUR
MOST OBVIOUS MISSING LINKS WE HAVE HIM WATSON WE HAVE HIM AND I
DARE SWEAR THAT BEFORE TOMORROW NIGHT HE WILL BE FLUTTERING IN OUR
NET AS HELPLESS AS ONE OF HIS OWN BUTTERFLIES A PIN A CORK AND A
CARD AND WE ADD HIM TO THE BAKER STREET COLLECTION HE BURST INTO
ONE OF HIS RARE FITS OF LAUGHTER AS HE TURNED AWAY FROM THE PICTURE
I HAVE NOT HEARD HIM LAUGH OFTEN AND IT HAS ALWAYS BODED ILL TO
SOMEBODY
I WAS UP BETIMES IN THE MORNING BUT HOLMES WAS AFOOT EARLIER STILL
FOR I SAW HIM AS I DRESSED COMING UP THE DRIVE
YES WE SHOULD HAVE A FULL DAY TODAY HE REMARKED AND HE RUBBED
HIS HANDS WITH THE JOY OF ACTION THE NETS ARE ALL IN PLACE AND THE
DRAG IS ABOUT TO BEGIN WELL KNOW BEFORE THE DAY IS OUT WHETHER WE
HAVE CAUGHT OUR BIG LEANJAWED PIKE OR WHETHER HE HAS GOT THROUGH
THE MESHES
HAVE YOU BEEN ON THE MOOR ALREADY
I HAVE SENT A REPORT FROM GRIMPEN TO PRINCETOWN AS TO THE DEATH OF
SELDEN I THINK I CAN PROMISE THAT NONE OF YOU WILL BE TROUBLED IN
THE MATTER AND I HAVE ALSO COMMUNICATED WITH MY FAITHFUL CARTWRIGHT
WHO WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE PINED AWAY AT THE DOOR OF MY HUT AS A DOG
DOES AT HIS MASTERS GRAVE IF I HAD NOT SET HIS MIND AT REST ABOUT
MY SAFETY
WHAT IS THE NEXT MOVE
TO SEE SIR HENRY AH HERE HE IS
GOOD MORNING HOLMES SAID THE BARONET YOU LOOK LIKE A GENERAL
WHO IS PLANNING A BATTLE WITH HIS CHIEF OF THE STAFF
THAT IS THE EXACT SITUATION WATSON WAS ASKING FOR ORDERS
AND SO DO I
VERY GOOD YOU ARE ENGAGED AS I UNDERSTAND TO DINE WITH OUR
FRIENDS THE STAPLETONS TONIGHT
I HOPE THAT YOU WILL COME ALSO THEY ARE VERY HOSPITABLE PEOPLE AND
I AM SURE THAT THEY WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU
I FEAR THAT WATSON AND I MUST GO TO LONDON
TO LONDON
YES I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE MORE USEFUL THERE AT THE PRESENT
JUNCTURE
THE BARONETS FACE PERCEPTIBLY LENGTHENED
I HOPED THAT YOU WERE GOING TO SEE ME THROUGH THIS BUSINESS THE
HALL AND THE MOOR ARE NOT VERY PLEASANT PLACES WHEN ONE IS ALONE
MY DEAR FELLOW YOU MUST TRUST ME IMPLICITLY AND DO EXACTLY WHAT I
TELL YOU YOU CAN TELL YOUR FRIENDS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO
HAVE COME WITH YOU BUT THAT URGENT BUSINESS REQUIRED US TO BE IN
TOWN WE HOPE VERY SOON TO RETURN TO DEVONSHIRE WILL YOU REMEMBER TO
GIVE THEM THAT MESSAGE
IF YOU INSIST UPON IT
THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE I ASSURE YOU
I SAW BY THE BARONETS CLOUDED BROW THAT HE WAS DEEPLY HURT BY WHAT
HE REGARDED AS OUR DESERTION
WHEN DO YOU DESIRE TO GO HE ASKED COLDLY
IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST WE WILL DRIVE IN TO COOMBE TRACEY BUT
WATSON WILL LEAVE HIS THINGS AS A PLEDGE THAT HE WILL COME BACK TO
YOU WATSON YOU WILL SEND A NOTE TO STAPLETON TO TELL HIM THAT YOU
REGRET THAT YOU CANNOT COME
I HAVE A GOOD MIND TO GO TO LONDON WITH YOU SAID THE BARONET WHY
SHOULD I STAY HERE ALONE
BECAUSE IT IS YOUR POST OF DUTY BECAUSE YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD THAT
YOU WOULD DO AS YOU WERE TOLD AND I TELL YOU TO STAY
ALL RIGHT THEN ILL STAY
ONE MORE DIRECTION I WISH YOU TO DRIVE TO MERRIPIT HOUSE SEND BACK
YOUR TRAP HOWEVER AND LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU INTEND TO WALK HOME
TO WALK ACROSS THE MOOR
YES
BUT THAT IS THE VERY THING WHICH YOU HAVE SO OFTEN CAUTIONED ME NOT
TO DO
THIS TIME YOU MAY DO IT WITH SAFETY IF I HAD NOT EVERY CONFIDENCE
IN YOUR NERVE AND COURAGE I WOULD NOT SUGGEST IT BUT IT IS ESSENTIAL
THAT YOU SHOULD DO IT
THEN I WILL DO IT
AND AS YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE DO NOT GO ACROSS THE MOOR IN ANY
DIRECTION SAVE ALONG THE STRAIGHT PATH WHICH LEADS FROM MERRIPIT
HOUSE TO THE GRIMPEN ROAD AND IS YOUR NATURAL WAY HOME
I WILL DO JUST WHAT YOU SAY
VERY GOOD I SHOULD BE GLAD TO GET AWAY AS SOON AFTER BREAKFAST AS
POSSIBLE SO AS TO REACH LONDON IN THE AFTERNOON
I WAS MUCH ASTOUNDED BY THIS PROGRAMME THOUGH I REMEMBERED THAT
HOLMES HAD SAID TO STAPLETON ON THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT HIS VISIT WOULD
TERMINATE NEXT DAY IT HAD NOT CROSSED MY MIND HOWEVER THAT HE
WOULD WISH ME TO GO WITH HIM NOR COULD I UNDERSTAND HOW WE COULD
BOTH BE ABSENT AT A MOMENT WHICH HE HIMSELF DECLARED TO BE CRITICAL
THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT HOWEVER BUT IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE SO WE BADE
GOODBYE TO OUR RUEFUL FRIEND AND A COUPLE OF HOURS AFTERWARDS WE
WERE AT THE STATION OF COOMBE TRACEY AND HAD DISPATCHED THE TRAP UPON
ITS RETURN JOURNEY A SMALL BOY WAS WAITING UPON THE PLATFORM
ANY ORDERS SIR
YOU WILL TAKE THIS TRAIN TO TOWN CARTWRIGHT THE MOMENT YOU ARRIVE
YOU WILL SEND A WIRE TO SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE IN MY NAME TO SAY
THAT IF HE FINDS THE POCKETBOOK WHICH I HAVE DROPPED HE IS TO SEND
IT BY REGISTERED POST TO BAKER STREET
YES SIR
AND ASK AT THE STATION OFFICE IF THERE IS A MESSAGE FOR ME
THE BOY RETURNED WITH A TELEGRAM WHICH HOLMES HANDED TO ME IT RAN
WIRE RECEIVED COMING DOWN WITH UNSIGNED WARRANT ARRIVE FIVEFORTY
LESTRADE
THAT IS IN ANSWER TO MINE OF THIS MORNING HE IS THE BEST OF THE
PROFESSIONALS I THINK AND WE MAY NEED HIS ASSISTANCE NOW WATSON
I THINK THAT WE CANNOT EMPLOY OUR TIME BETTER THAN BY CALLING UPON
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE MRS LAURA LYONS
HIS PLAN OF CAMPAIGN WAS BEGINNING TO BE EVIDENT HE WOULD USE THE
BARONET IN ORDER TO CONVINCE THE STAPLETONS THAT WE WERE REALLY GONE
WHILE WE SHOULD ACTUALLY RETURN AT THE INSTANT WHEN WE WERE LIKELY TO
BE NEEDED THAT TELEGRAM FROM LONDON IF MENTIONED BY SIR HENRY TO
THE STAPLETONS MUST REMOVE THE LAST SUSPICIONS FROM THEIR MINDS
ALREADY I SEEMED TO SEE OUR NETS DRAWING CLOSER AROUND THAT
LEANJAWED PIKE
MRS LAURA LYONS WAS IN HER OFFICE AND SHERLOCK HOLMES OPENED HIS
INTERVIEW WITH A FRANKNESS AND DIRECTNESS WHICH CONSIDERABLY AMAZED
HER
I AM INVESTIGATING THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ATTENDED THE DEATH OF THE
LATE SIR CHARLES BASKERVILLE SAID HE MY FRIEND HERE DR WATSON
HAS INFORMED ME OF WHAT YOU HAVE COMMUNICATED AND ALSO OF WHAT YOU
HAVE WITHHELD IN CONNECTION WITH THAT MATTER
WHAT HAVE I WITHHELD SHE ASKED DEFIANTLY
YOU HAVE CONFESSED THAT YOU ASKED SIR CHARLES TO BE AT THE GATE AT
TEN OCLOCK WE KNOW THAT THAT WAS THE PLACE AND HOUR OF HIS DEATH
YOU HAVE WITHHELD WHAT THE CONNECTION IS BETWEEN THESE EVENTS
THERE IS NO CONNECTION
IN THAT CASE THE COINCIDENCE MUST INDEED BE AN EXTRAORDINARY ONE
BUT I THINK THAT WE SHALL SUCCEED IN ESTABLISHING A CONNECTION AFTER
ALL I WISH TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK WITH YOU MRS LYONS WE REGARD
THIS CASE AS ONE OF MURDER AND THE EVIDENCE MAY IMPLICATE NOT ONLY
YOUR FRIEND MR STAPLETON BUT HIS WIFE AS WELL
THE LADY SPRANG FROM HER CHAIR
HIS WIFE SHE CRIED
THE FACT IS NO LONGER A SECRET THE PERSON WHO HAS PASSED FOR HIS
SISTER IS REALLY HIS WIFE
MRS LYONS HAD RESUMED HER SEAT HER HANDS WERE GRASPING THE ARMS OF
HER CHAIR AND I SAW THAT THE PINK NAILS HAD TURNED WHITE WITH THE
PRESSURE OF HER GRIP
HIS WIFE SHE SAID AGAIN HIS WIFE HE IS NOT A MARRIED MAN
SHERLOCK HOLMES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
PROVE IT TO ME PROVE IT TO ME AND IF YOU CAN DO SO THE FIERCE
FLASH OF HER EYES SAID MORE THAN ANY WORDS
I HAVE COME PREPARED TO DO SO SAID HOLMES DRAWING SEVERAL PAPERS
FROM HIS POCKET HERE IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE COUPLE TAKEN IN YORK
FOUR YEARS AGO IT IS INDORSED MR AND MRS VANDELEUR BUT YOU WILL
HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNIZING HIM AND HER ALSO IF YOU KNOW HER
BY SIGHT HERE ARE THREE WRITTEN DESCRIPTIONS BY TRUSTWORTHY
WITNESSES OF MR AND MRS VANDELEUR WHO AT THAT TIME KEPT ST
OLIVERS PRIVATE SCHOOL READ THEM AND SEE IF YOU CAN DOUBT THE
IDENTITY OF THESE PEOPLE
SHE GLANCED AT THEM AND THEN LOOKED UP AT US WITH THE SET RIGID
FACE OF A DESPERATE WOMAN
MR HOLMES SHE SAID THIS MAN HAD OFFERED ME MARRIAGE ON
CONDITION THAT I COULD GET A DIVORCE FROM MY HUSBAND HE HAS LIED TO
ME THE VILLAIN IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY NOT ONE WORD OF TRUTH HAS
HE EVER TOLD ME AND WHYWHY I IMAGINED THAT ALL WAS FOR MY OWN
SAKE BUT NOW I SEE THAT I WAS NEVER ANYTHING BUT A TOOL IN HIS
HANDS WHY SHOULD I PRESERVE FAITH WITH HIM WHO NEVER KEPT ANY WITH
ME WHY SHOULD I TRY TO SHIELD HIM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS OWN
WICKED ACTS ASK ME WHAT YOU LIKE AND THERE IS NOTHING WHICH I SHALL
HOLD BACK ONE THING I SWEAR TO YOU AND THAT IS THAT WHEN I WROTE
THE LETTER I NEVER DREAMED OF ANY HARM TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD
BEEN MY KINDEST FRIEND
I ENTIRELY BELIEVE YOU MADAM SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES THE RECITAL
OF THESE EVENTS MUST BE VERY PAINFUL TO YOU AND PERHAPS IT WILL MAKE
IT EASIER IF I TELL YOU WHAT OCCURRED AND YOU CAN CHECK ME IF I MAKE
ANY MATERIAL MISTAKE THE SENDING OF THIS LETTER WAS SUGGESTED TO YOU
BY STAPLETON
HE DICTATED IT
I PRESUME THAT THE REASON HE GAVE WAS THAT YOU WOULD RECEIVE HELP
FROM SIR CHARLES FOR THE LEGAL EXPENSES CONNECTED WITH YOUR DIVORCE
EXACTLY
AND THEN AFTER YOU HAD SENT THE LETTER HE DISSUADED YOU FROM KEEPING
THE APPOINTMENT
HE TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD HURT HIS SELFRESPECT THAT ANY OTHER MAN
SHOULD FIND THE MONEY FOR SUCH AN OBJECT AND THAT THOUGH HE WAS A
POOR MAN HIMSELF HE WOULD DEVOTE HIS LAST PENNY TO REMOVING THE
OBSTACLES WHICH DIVIDED US
HE APPEARS TO BE A VERY CONSISTENT CHARACTER AND THEN YOU HEARD
NOTHING UNTIL YOU READ THE REPORTS OF THE DEATH IN THE PAPER
NO
AND HE MADE YOU SWEAR TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT YOUR APPOINTMENT WITH SIR
CHARLES
HE DID HE SAID THAT THE DEATH WAS A VERY MYSTERIOUS ONE AND THAT I
SHOULD CERTAINLY BE SUSPECTED IF THE FACTS CAME OUT HE FRIGHTENED ME
INTO REMAINING SILENT
QUITE SO BUT YOU HAD YOUR SUSPICIONS
SHE HESITATED AND LOOKED DOWN
I KNEW HIM SHE SAID BUT IF HE HAD KEPT FAITH WITH ME I SHOULD
ALWAYS HAVE DONE SO WITH HIM
I THINK THAT ON THE WHOLE YOU HAVE HAD A FORTUNATE ESCAPE SAID
SHERLOCK HOLMES YOU HAVE HAD HIM IN YOUR POWER AND HE KNEW IT AND
YET YOU ARE ALIVE YOU HAVE BEEN WALKING FOR SOME MONTHS VERY NEAR TO
THE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE WE MUST WISH YOU GOODMORNING NOW MRS
LYONS AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT YOU WILL VERY SHORTLY HEAR FROM US
AGAIN
OUR CASE BECOMES ROUNDED OFF AND DIFFICULTY AFTER DIFFICULTY THINS
AWAY IN FRONT OF US SAID HOLMES AS WE STOOD WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL
OF THE EXPRESS FROM TOWN I SHALL SOON BE IN THE POSITION OF BEING
ABLE TO PUT INTO A SINGLE CONNECTED NARRATIVE ONE OF THE MOST
SINGULAR AND SENSATIONAL CRIMES OF MODERN TIMES STUDENTS OF
CRIMINOLOGY WILL REMEMBER THE ANALOGOUS INCIDENTS IN GODNO IN LITTLE
RUSSIA IN THE YEAR AND OF COURSE THERE ARE THE ANDERSON MURDERS
IN NORTH CAROLINA BUT THIS CASE POSSESSES SOME FEATURES WHICH ARE
ENTIRELY ITS OWN EVEN NOW WE HAVE NO CLEAR CASE AGAINST THIS VERY
WILY MAN BUT I SHALL BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED IF IT IS NOT CLEAR
ENOUGH BEFORE WE GO TO BED THIS NIGHT
THE LONDON EXPRESS CAME ROARING INTO THE STATION AND A SMALL WIRY
BULLDOG OF A MAN HAD SPRUNG FROM A FIRSTCLASS CARRIAGE WE ALL THREE
SHOOK HANDS AND I SAW AT ONCE FROM THE REVERENTIAL WAY IN WHICH
LESTRADE GAZED AT MY COMPANION THAT HE HAD LEARNED A GOOD DEAL SINCE
THE DAYS WHEN THEY HAD FIRST WORKED TOGETHER I COULD WELL REMEMBER
THE SCORN WHICH THE THEORIES OF THE REASONER USED THEN TO EXCITE IN
THE PRACTICAL MAN
ANYTHING GOOD HE ASKED
THE BIGGEST THING FOR YEARS SAID HOLMES WE HAVE TWO HOURS BEFORE
WE NEED THINK OF STARTING I THINK WE MIGHT EMPLOY IT IN GETTING SOME
DINNER AND THEN LESTRADE WE WILL TAKE THE LONDON FOG OUT OF YOUR
THROAT BY GIVING YOU A BREATH OF THE PURE NIGHT AIR OF DARTMOOR
NEVER BEEN THERE AH WELL I DONT SUPPOSE YOU WILL FORGET YOUR
FIRST VISIT
CHAPTER XIV
THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES
ONE OF SHERLOCK HOLMESS DEFECTSIF INDEED ONE MAY CALL IT A
DEFECTWAS THAT HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY LOATH TO COMMUNICATE HIS FULL
PLANS TO ANY OTHER PERSON UNTIL THE INSTANT OF THEIR FULFILMENT
PARTLY IT CAME NO DOUBT FROM HIS OWN MASTERFUL NATURE WHICH LOVED TO
DOMINATE AND SURPRISE THOSE WHO WERE AROUND HIM PARTLY ALSO FROM HIS
PROFESSIONAL CAUTION WHICH URGED HIM NEVER TO TAKE ANY CHANCES THE
RESULT HOWEVER WAS VERY TRYING FOR THOSE WHO WERE ACTING AS HIS
AGENTS AND ASSISTANTS I HAD OFTEN SUFFERED UNDER IT BUT NEVER MORE
SO THAN DURING THAT LONG DRIVE IN THE DARKNESS THE GREAT ORDEAL WAS
IN FRONT OF US AT LAST WE WERE ABOUT TO MAKE OUR FINAL EFFORT AND
YET HOLMES HAD SAID NOTHING AND I COULD ONLY SURMISE WHAT HIS COURSE
OF ACTION WOULD BE MY NERVES THRILLED WITH ANTICIPATION WHEN AT LAST
THE COLD WIND UPON OUR FACES AND THE DARK VOID SPACES ON EITHER SIDE
OF THE NARROW ROAD TOLD ME THAT WE WERE BACK UPON THE MOOR ONCE
AGAIN EVERY STRIDE OF THE HORSES AND EVERY TURN OF THE WHEELS WAS
TAKING US NEARER TO OUR SUPREME ADVENTURE
OUR CONVERSATION WAS HAMPERED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE DRIVER OF THE
HIRED WAGONETTE SO THAT WE WERE FORCED TO TALK OF TRIVIAL MATTERS
WHEN OUR NERVES WERE TENSE WITH EMOTION AND ANTICIPATION IT WAS A
RELIEF TO ME AFTER THAT UNNATURAL RESTRAINT WHEN WE AT LAST PASSED
FRANKLANDS HOUSE AND KNEW THAT WE WERE DRAWING NEAR TO THE HALL AND
TO THE SCENE OF ACTION WE DID NOT DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR BUT GOT DOWN
NEAR THE GATE OF THE AVENUE THE WAGONETTE WAS PAID OFF AND ORDERED
TO RETURN TO COOMBE TRACEY FORTHWITH WHILE WE STARTED TO WALK TO
MERRIPIT HOUSE
ARE YOU ARMED LESTRADE
THE LITTLE DETECTIVE SMILED
AS LONG AS I HAVE MY TROUSERS I HAVE A HIPPOCKET AND AS LONG AS I
HAVE MY HIPPOCKET I HAVE SOMETHING IN IT
GOOD MY FRIEND AND I ARE ALSO READY FOR EMERGENCIES
YOURE MIGHTY CLOSE ABOUT THIS AFFAIR MR HOLMES WHATS THE GAME
NOW
A WAITING GAME
MY WORD IT DOES NOT SEEM A VERY CHEERFUL PLACE SAID THE DETECTIVE
WITH A SHIVER GLANCING ROUND HIM AT THE GLOOMY SLOPES OF THE HILL
AND AT THE HUGE LAKE OF FOG WHICH LAY OVER THE GRIMPEN MIRE I SEE
THE LIGHTS OF A HOUSE AHEAD OF US
THAT IS MERRIPIT HOUSE AND THE END OF OUR JOURNEY I MUST REQUEST
YOU TO WALK ON TIPTOE AND NOT TO TALK ABOVE A WHISPER
WE MOVED CAUTIOUSLY ALONG THE TRACK AS IF WE WERE BOUND FOR THE
HOUSE BUT HOLMES HALTED US WHEN WE WERE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM
IT
THIS WILL DO SAID HE THESE ROCKS UPON THE RIGHT MAKE AN
ADMIRABLE SCREEN
WE ARE TO WAIT HERE
YES WE SHALL MAKE OUR LITTLE AMBUSH HERE GET INTO THIS HOLLOW
LESTRADE YOU HAVE BEEN INSIDE THE HOUSE HAVE YOU NOT WATSON CAN
YOU TELL THE POSITION OF THE ROOMS WHAT ARE THOSE LATTICED WINDOWS
AT THIS END
I THINK THEY ARE THE KITCHEN WINDOWS
AND THE ONE BEYOND WHICH SHINES SO BRIGHTLY
THAT IS CERTAINLY THE DININGROOM
THE BLINDS ARE UP YOU KNOW THE LIE OF THE LAND BEST CREEP FORWARD
QUIETLY AND SEE WHAT THEY ARE DOINGBUT FOR HEAVENS SAKE DONT LET
THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE WATCHED
I TIPTOED DOWN THE PATH AND STOOPED BEHIND THE LOW WALL WHICH
SURROUNDED THE STUNTED ORCHARD CREEPING IN ITS SHADOW I REACHED A
POINT WHENCE I COULD LOOK STRAIGHT THROUGH THE UNCURTAINED WINDOW
THERE WERE ONLY TWO MEN IN THE ROOM SIR HENRY AND STAPLETON THEY
SAT WITH THEIR PROFILES TOWARDS ME ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROUND TABLE
BOTH OF THEM WERE SMOKING CIGARS AND COFFEE AND WINE WERE IN FRONT
OF THEM STAPLETON WAS TALKING WITH ANIMATION BUT THE BARONET LOOKED
PALE AND DISTRAIT PERHAPS THE THOUGHT OF THAT LONELY WALK ACROSS THE
ILLOMENED MOOR WAS WEIGHING HEAVILY UPON HIS MIND
AS I WATCHED THEM STAPLETON ROSE AND LEFT THE ROOM WHILE SIR HENRY
FILLED HIS GLASS AGAIN AND LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR PUFFING AT HIS
CIGAR I HEARD THE CREAK OF A DOOR AND THE CRISP SOUND OF BOOTS UPON
GRAVEL THE STEPS PASSED ALONG THE PATH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL
UNDER WHICH I CROUCHED LOOKING OVER I SAW THE NATURALIST PAUSE AT
THE DOOR OF AN OUTHOUSE IN THE CORNER OF THE ORCHARD A KEY TURNED
IN A LOCK AND AS HE PASSED IN THERE WAS A CURIOUS SCUFFLING NOISE
FROM WITHIN HE WAS ONLY A MINUTE OR SO INSIDE AND THEN I HEARD THE
KEY TURN ONCE MORE AND HE PASSED ME AND REENTERED THE HOUSE I SAW
HIM REJOIN HIS GUEST AND I CREPT QUIETLY BACK TO WHERE MY COMPANIONS
WERE WAITING TO TELL THEM WHAT I HAD SEEN
YOU SAY WATSON THAT THE LADY IS NOT THERE HOLMES ASKED WHEN I
HAD FINISHED MY REPORT
NO
WHERE CAN SHE BE THEN SINCE THERE IS NO LIGHT IN ANY OTHER ROOM
EXCEPT THE KITCHEN
I CANNOT THINK WHERE SHE IS
I HAVE SAID THAT OVER THE GREAT GRIMPEN MIRE THERE HUNG A DENSE
WHITE FOG IT WAS DRIFTING SLOWLY IN OUR DIRECTION AND BANKED ITSELF
UP LIKE A WALL ON THAT SIDE OF US LOW BUT THICK AND WELL DEFINED
THE MOON SHONE ON IT AND IT LOOKED LIKE A GREAT SHIMMERING
ICEFIELD WITH THE HEADS OF THE DISTANT TORS AS ROCKS BORNE UPON ITS
SURFACE HOLMESS FACE WAS TURNED TOWARDS IT AND HE MUTTERED
IMPATIENTLY AS HE WATCHED ITS SLUGGISH DRIFT
ITS MOVING TOWARDS US WATSON
IS THAT SERIOUS
VERY SERIOUS INDEEDTHE ONE THING UPON EARTH WHICH COULD HAVE
DISARRANGED MY PLANS HE CANT BE VERY LONG NOW IT IS ALREADY TEN
OCLOCK OUR SUCCESS AND EVEN HIS LIFE MAY DEPEND UPON HIS COMING OUT
BEFORE THE FOG IS OVER THE PATH
THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR AND FINE ABOVE US THE STARS SHONE COLD AND
BRIGHT WHILE A HALFMOON BATHED THE WHOLE SCENE IN A SOFT UNCERTAIN
LIGHT BEFORE US LAY THE DARK BULK OF THE HOUSE ITS SERRATED ROOF
AND BRISTLING CHIMNEYS HARD OUTLINED AGAINST THE SILVERSPANGLED SKY
BROAD BARS OF GOLDEN LIGHT FROM THE LOWER WINDOWS STRETCHED ACROSS
THE ORCHARD AND THE MOOR ONE OF THEM WAS SUDDENLY SHUT OFF THE
SERVANTS HAD LEFT THE KITCHEN THERE ONLY REMAINED THE LAMP IN THE
DININGROOM WHERE THE TWO MEN THE MURDEROUS HOST AND THE UNCONSCIOUS
GUEST STILL CHATTED OVER THEIR CIGARS
EVERY MINUTE THAT WHITE WOOLLY PLAIN WHICH COVERED ONE HALF OF THE
MOOR WAS DRIFTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE HOUSE ALREADY THE FIRST
THIN WISPS OF IT WERE CURLING ACROSS THE GOLDEN SQUARE OF THE LIGHTED
WINDOW THE FARTHER WALL OF THE ORCHARD WAS ALREADY INVISIBLE AND
THE TREES WERE STANDING OUT OF A SWIRL OF WHITE VAPOUR AS WE WATCHED
IT THE FOGWREATHS CAME CRAWLING ROUND BOTH CORNERS OF THE HOUSE AND
ROLLED SLOWLY INTO ONE DENSE BANK ON WHICH THE UPPER FLOOR AND THE
ROOF FLOATED LIKE A STRANGE SHIP UPON A SHADOWY SEA HOLMES STRUCK
HIS HAND PASSIONATELY UPON THE ROCK IN FRONT OF US AND STAMPED HIS
FEET IN HIS IMPATIENCE
IF HE ISNT OUT IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THE PATH WILL BE COVERED IN
HALF AN HOUR WE WONT BE ABLE TO SEE OUR HANDS IN FRONT OF US
SHALL WE MOVE FARTHER BACK UPON HIGHER GROUND
YES I THINK IT WOULD BE AS WELL
SO AS THE FOGBANK FLOWED ONWARD WE FELL BACK BEFORE IT UNTIL WE WERE
HALF A MILE FROM THE HOUSE AND STILL THAT DENSE WHITE SEA WITH THE
MOON SILVERING ITS UPPER EDGE SWEPT SLOWLY AND INEXORABLY ON
WE ARE GOING TOO FAR SAID HOLMES WE DARE NOT TAKE THE CHANCE OF
HIS BEING OVERTAKEN BEFORE HE CAN REACH US AT ALL COSTS WE MUST HOLD
OUR GROUND WHERE WE ARE HE DROPPED ON HIS KNEES AND CLAPPED HIS EAR
TO THE GROUND THANK GOD I THINK THAT I HEAR HIM COMING
A SOUND OF QUICK STEPS BROKE THE SILENCE OF THE MOOR CROUCHING AMONG
THE STONES WE STARED INTENTLY AT THE SILVERTIPPED BANK IN FRONT OF
US THE STEPS GREW LOUDER AND THROUGH THE FOG AS THROUGH A CURTAIN
THERE STEPPED THE MAN WHOM WE WERE AWAITING HE LOOKED ROUND HIM IN
SURPRISE AS HE EMERGED INTO THE CLEAR STARLIT NIGHT THEN HE CAME
SWIFTLY ALONG THE PATH PASSED CLOSE TO WHERE WE LAY AND WENT ON UP
THE LONG SLOPE BEHIND US AS HE WALKED HE GLANCED CONTINUALLY OVER
EITHER SHOULDER LIKE A MAN WHO IS ILL AT EASE
HIST CRIED HOLMES AND I HEARD THE SHARP CLICK OF A COCKING
PISTOL LOOK OUT ITS COMING
THERE WAS A THIN CRISP CONTINUOUS PATTER FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE
HEART OF THAT CRAWLING BANK THE CLOUD WAS WITHIN FIFTY YARDS OF
WHERE WE LAY AND WE GLARED AT IT ALL THREE UNCERTAIN WHAT HORROR
WAS ABOUT TO BREAK FROM THE HEART OF IT I WAS AT HOLMESS ELBOW AND
I GLANCED FOR AN INSTANT AT HIS FACE IT WAS PALE AND EXULTANT HIS
EYES SHINING BRIGHTLY IN THE MOONLIGHT BUT SUDDENLY THEY STARTED
FORWARD IN A RIGID FIXED STARE AND HIS LIPS PARTED IN AMAZEMENT AT
THE SAME INSTANT LESTRADE GAVE A YELL OF TERROR AND THREW HIMSELF
FACE DOWNWARD UPON THE GROUND I SPRANG TO MY FEET MY INERT HAND
GRASPING MY PISTOL MY MIND PARALYZED BY THE DREADFUL SHAPE WHICH HAD
SPRUNG OUT UPON US FROM THE SHADOWS OF THE FOG A HOUND IT WAS AN
ENORMOUS COALBLACK HOUND BUT NOT SUCH A HOUND AS MORTAL EYES HAVE
EVER SEEN FIRE BURST FROM ITS OPEN MOUTH ITS EYES GLOWED WITH A
SMOULDERING GLARE ITS MUZZLE AND HACKLES AND DEWLAP WERE OUTLINED IN
FLICKERING FLAME NEVER IN THE DELIRIOUS DREAM OF A DISORDERED BRAIN
COULD ANYTHING MORE SAVAGE MORE APPALLING MORE HELLISH BE CONCEIVED
THAN THAT DARK FORM AND SAVAGE FACE WHICH BROKE UPON US OUT OF THE
WALL OF FOG
WITH LONG BOUNDS THE HUGE BLACK CREATURE WAS LEAPING DOWN THE TRACK
FOLLOWING HARD UPON THE FOOTSTEPS OF OUR FRIEND SO PARALYZED WERE WE
BY THE APPARITION THAT WE ALLOWED HIM TO PASS BEFORE WE HAD RECOVERED
OUR NERVE THEN HOLMES AND I BOTH FIRED TOGETHER AND THE CREATURE
GAVE A HIDEOUS HOWL WHICH SHOWED THAT ONE AT LEAST HAD HIT HIM HE
DID NOT PAUSE HOWEVER BUT BOUNDED ONWARD FAR AWAY ON THE PATH WE
SAW SIR HENRY LOOKING BACK HIS FACE WHITE IN THE MOONLIGHT HIS
HANDS RAISED IN HORROR GLARING HELPLESSLY AT THE FRIGHTFUL THING
WHICH WAS HUNTING HIM DOWN
BUT THAT CRY OF PAIN FROM THE HOUND HAD BLOWN ALL OUR FEARS TO THE
WINDS IF HE WAS VULNERABLE HE WAS MORTAL AND IF WE COULD WOUND HIM
WE COULD KILL HIM NEVER HAVE I SEEN A MAN RUN AS HOLMES RAN THAT
NIGHT I AM RECKONED FLEET OF FOOT BUT HE OUTPACED ME AS MUCH AS I
OUTPACED THE LITTLE PROFESSIONAL IN FRONT OF US AS WE FLEW UP THE
TRACK WE HEARD SCREAM AFTER SCREAM FROM SIR HENRY AND THE DEEP ROAR
OF THE HOUND I WAS IN TIME TO SEE THE BEAST SPRING UPON ITS VICTIM
HURL HIM TO THE GROUND AND WORRY AT HIS THROAT BUT THE NEXT INSTANT
HOLMES HAD EMPTIED FIVE BARRELS OF HIS REVOLVER INTO THE CREATURES
FLANK WITH A LAST HOWL OF AGONY AND A VICIOUS SNAP IN THE AIR IT
ROLLED UPON ITS BACK FOUR FEET PAWING FURIOUSLY AND THEN FELL LIMP
UPON ITS SIDE I STOOPED PANTING AND PRESSED MY PISTOL TO THE
DREADFUL SHIMMERING HEAD BUT IT WAS USELESS TO PRESS THE TRIGGER
THE GIANT HOUND WAS DEAD
SIR HENRY LAY INSENSIBLE WHERE HE HAD FALLEN WE TORE AWAY HIS
COLLAR AND HOLMES BREATHED A PRAYER OF GRATITUDE WHEN WE SAW THAT
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF A WOUND AND THAT THE RESCUE HAD BEEN IN TIME
ALREADY OUR FRIENDS EYELIDS SHIVERED AND HE MADE A FEEBLE EFFORT TO
MOVE LESTRADE THRUST HIS BRANDYFLASK BETWEEN THE BARONETS TEETH
AND TWO FRIGHTENED EYES WERE LOOKING UP AT US
MY GOD HE WHISPERED WHAT WAS IT WHAT IN HEAVENS NAME WAS
IT
ITS DEAD WHATEVER IT IS SAID HOLMES WEVE LAID THE FAMILY
GHOST ONCE AND FOREVER
IN MERE SIZE AND STRENGTH IT WAS A TERRIBLE CREATURE WHICH WAS LYING
STRETCHED BEFORE US IT WAS NOT A PURE BLOODHOUND AND IT WAS NOT A
PURE MASTIFF BUT IT APPEARED TO BE A COMBINATION OF THE TWOGAUNT
SAVAGE AND AS LARGE AS A SMALL LIONESS EVEN NOW IN THE STILLNESS
OF DEATH THE HUGE JAWS SEEMED TO BE DRIPPING WITH A BLUISH FLAME AND
THE SMALL DEEPSET CRUEL EYES WERE RINGED WITH FIRE I PLACED MY
HAND UPON THE GLOWING MUZZLE AND AS I HELD THEM UP MY OWN FINGERS
SMOULDERED AND GLEAMED IN THE DARKNESS
PHOSPHORUS I SAID
A CUNNING PREPARATION OF IT SAID HOLMES SNIFFING AT THE DEAD
ANIMAL THERE IS NO SMELL WHICH MIGHT HAVE INTERFERED WITH HIS POWER
OF SCENT WE OWE YOU A DEEP APOLOGY SIR HENRY FOR HAVING EXPOSED
YOU TO THIS FRIGHT I WAS PREPARED FOR A HOUND BUT NOT FOR SUCH A
CREATURE AS THIS AND THE FOG GAVE US LITTLE TIME TO RECEIVE HIM
YOU HAVE SAVED MY LIFE
HAVING FIRST ENDANGERED IT ARE YOU STRONG ENOUGH TO STAND
GIVE ME ANOTHER MOUTHFUL OF THAT BRANDY AND I SHALL BE READY FOR
ANYTHING SO NOW IF YOU WILL HELP ME UP WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO
DO
TO LEAVE YOU HERE YOU ARE NOT FIT FOR FURTHER ADVENTURES TONIGHT
IF YOU WILL WAIT ONE OR OTHER OF US WILL GO BACK WITH YOU TO THE
HALL
HE TRIED TO STAGGER TO HIS FEET BUT HE WAS STILL GHASTLY PALE AND
TREMBLING IN EVERY LIMB WE HELPED HIM TO A ROCK WHERE HE SAT
SHIVERING WITH HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS
WE MUST LEAVE YOU NOW SAID HOLMES THE REST OF OUR WORK MUST BE
DONE AND EVERY MOMENT IS OF IMPORTANCE WE HAVE OUR CASE AND NOW WE
ONLY WANT OUR MAN
ITS A THOUSAND TO ONE AGAINST OUR FINDING HIM AT THE HOUSE HE
CONTINUED AS WE RETRACED OUR STEPS SWIFTLY DOWN THE PATH THOSE
SHOTS MUST HAVE TOLD HIM THAT THE GAME WAS UP
WE WERE SOME DISTANCE OFF AND THIS FOG MAY HAVE DEADENED THEM
HE FOLLOWED THE HOUND TO CALL HIM OFFOF THAT YOU MAY BE CERTAIN
NO NO HES GONE BY THIS TIME BUT WELL SEARCH THE HOUSE AND MAKE
SURE
THE FRONT DOOR WAS OPEN SO WE RUSHED IN AND HURRIED FROM ROOM TO
ROOM TO THE AMAZEMENT OF A DODDERING OLD MANSERVANT WHO MET US IN
THE PASSAGE THERE WAS NO LIGHT SAVE IN THE DININGROOM BUT HOLMES
CAUGHT UP THE LAMP AND LEFT NO CORNER OF THE HOUSE UNEXPLORED NO
SIGN COULD WE SEE OF THE MAN WHOM WE WERE CHASING ON THE UPPER
FLOOR HOWEVER ONE OF THE BEDROOM DOORS WAS LOCKED
THERES SOMEONE IN HERE CRIED LESTRADE I CAN HEAR A MOVEMENT
OPEN THIS DOOR
A FAINT MOANING AND RUSTLING CAME FROM WITHIN HOLMES STRUCK THE DOOR
JUST OVER THE LOCK WITH THE FLAT OF HIS FOOT AND IT FLEW OPEN PISTOL
IN HAND WE ALL THREE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM
BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN WITHIN IT OF THAT DESPERATE AND DEFIANT VILLAIN
WHOM WE EXPECTED TO SEE INSTEAD WE WERE FACED BY AN OBJECT SO
STRANGE AND SO UNEXPECTED THAT WE STOOD FOR A MOMENT STARING AT IT IN
AMAZEMENT
THE ROOM HAD BEEN FASHIONED INTO A SMALL MUSEUM AND THE WALLS WERE
LINED BY A NUMBER OF GLASSTOPPED CASES FULL OF THAT COLLECTION OF
BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS THE FORMATION OF WHICH HAD BEEN THE RELAXATION
OF THIS COMPLEX AND DANGEROUS MAN IN THE CENTRE OF THIS ROOM THERE
WAS AN UPRIGHT BEAM WHICH HAD BEEN PLACED AT SOME PERIOD AS A
SUPPORT FOR THE OLD WORMEATEN BAULK OF TIMBER WHICH SPANNED THE
ROOF TO THIS POST A FIGURE WAS TIED SO SWATHED AND MUFFLED IN THE
SHEETS WHICH HAD BEEN USED TO SECURE IT THAT ONE COULD NOT FOR THE
MOMENT TELL WHETHER IT WAS THAT OF A MAN OR A WOMAN ONE TOWEL PASSED
ROUND THE THROAT AND WAS SECURED AT THE BACK OF THE PILLAR ANOTHER
COVERED THE LOWER PART OF THE FACE AND OVER IT TWO DARK EYESEYES
FULL OF GRIEF AND SHAME AND A DREADFUL QUESTIONINGSTARED BACK AT
US IN A MINUTE WE HAD TORN OFF THE GAG UNSWATHED THE BONDS AND
MRS STAPLETON SANK UPON THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF US AS HER BEAUTIFUL
HEAD FELL UPON HER CHEST I SAW THE CLEAR RED WEAL OF A WHIPLASH
ACROSS HER NECK
THE BRUTE CRIED HOLMES HERE LESTRADE YOUR BRANDYBOTTLE PUT
HER IN THE CHAIR SHE HAS FAINTED FROM ILLUSAGE AND EXHAUSTION
SHE OPENED HER EYES AGAIN
IS HE SAFE SHE ASKED HAS HE ESCAPED
HE CANNOT ESCAPE US MADAM
NO NO I DID NOT MEAN MY HUSBAND SIR HENRY IS HE SAFE
YES
AND THE HOUND
IT IS DEAD
SHE GAVE A LONG SIGH OF SATISFACTION
THANK GOD THANK GOD OH THIS VILLAIN SEE HOW HE HAS TREATED ME
SHE SHOT HER ARMS OUT FROM HER SLEEVES AND WE SAW WITH HORROR THAT
THEY WERE ALL MOTTLED WITH BRUISES BUT THIS IS NOTHINGNOTHING IT
IS MY MIND AND SOUL THAT HE HAS TORTURED AND DEFILED I COULD ENDURE
IT ALL ILLUSAGE SOLITUDE A LIFE OF DECEPTION EVERYTHING AS LONG
AS I COULD STILL CLING TO THE HOPE THAT I HAD HIS LOVE BUT NOW I
KNOW THAT IN THIS ALSO I HAVE BEEN HIS DUPE AND HIS TOOL SHE BROKE
INTO PASSIONATE SOBBING AS SHE SPOKE
YOU BEAR HIM NO GOOD WILL MADAM SAID HOLMES TELL US THEN WHERE
WE SHALL FIND HIM IF YOU HAVE EVER AIDED HIM IN EVIL HELP US NOW
AND SO ATONE
THERE IS BUT ONE PLACE WHERE HE CAN HAVE FLED SHE ANSWERED THERE
IS AN OLD TIN MINE ON AN ISLAND IN THE HEART OF THE MIRE IT WAS
THERE THAT HE KEPT HIS HOUND AND THERE ALSO HE HAD MADE PREPARATIONS
SO THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A REFUGE THAT IS WHERE HE WOULD FLY
THE FOGBANK LAY LIKE WHITE WOOL AGAINST THE WINDOW HOLMES HELD THE
LAMP TOWARDS IT
SEE SAID HE NO ONE COULD FIND HIS WAY INTO THE GRIMPEN MIRE
TONIGHT
SHE LAUGHED AND CLAPPED HER HANDS HER EYES AND TEETH GLEAMED WITH
FIERCE MERRIMENT
HE MAY FIND HIS WAY IN BUT NEVER OUT SHE CRIED HOW CAN HE SEE
THE GUIDING WANDS TONIGHT WE PLANTED THEM TOGETHER HE AND I TO
MARK THE PATHWAY THROUGH THE MIRE OH IF I COULD ONLY HAVE PLUCKED
THEM OUT TODAY THEN INDEED YOU WOULD HAVE HAD HIM AT YOUR MERCY
IT WAS EVIDENT TO US THAT ALL PURSUIT WAS IN VAIN UNTIL THE FOG HAD
LIFTED MEANWHILE WE LEFT LESTRADE IN POSSESSION OF THE HOUSE WHILE
HOLMES AND I WENT BACK WITH THE BARONET TO BASKERVILLE HALL THE
STORY OF THE STAPLETONS COULD NO LONGER BE WITHHELD FROM HIM BUT HE
TOOK THE BLOW BRAVELY WHEN HE LEARNED THE TRUTH ABOUT THE WOMAN WHOM
HE HAD LOVED BUT THE SHOCK OF THE NIGHTS ADVENTURES HAD SHATTERED
HIS NERVES AND BEFORE MORNING HE LAY DELIRIOUS IN A HIGH FEVER
UNDER THE CARE OF DR MORTIMER THE TWO OF THEM WERE DESTINED TO
TRAVEL TOGETHER ROUND THE WORLD BEFORE SIR HENRY HAD BECOME ONCE MORE
THE HALE HEARTY MAN THAT HE HAD BEEN BEFORE HE BECAME MASTER OF THAT
ILLOMENED ESTATE
AND NOW I COME RAPIDLY TO THE CONCLUSION OF THIS SINGULAR NARRATIVE
IN WHICH I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE THE READER SHARE THOSE DARK FEARS AND
VAGUE SURMISES WHICH CLOUDED OUR LIVES SO LONG AND ENDED IN SO TRAGIC
A MANNER ON THE MORNING AFTER THE DEATH OF THE HOUND THE FOG HAD
LIFTED AND WE WERE GUIDED BY MRS STAPLETON TO THE POINT WHERE THEY
HAD FOUND A PATHWAY THROUGH THE BOG IT HELPED US TO REALIZE THE
HORROR OF THIS WOMANS LIFE WHEN WE SAW THE EAGERNESS AND JOY WITH
WHICH SHE LAID US ON HER HUSBANDS TRACK WE LEFT HER STANDING UPON
THE THIN PENINSULA OF FIRM PEATY SOIL WHICH TAPERED OUT INTO THE
WIDESPREAD BOG FROM THE END OF IT A SMALL WAND PLANTED HERE AND
THERE SHOWED WHERE THE PATH ZIGZAGGED FROM TUFT TO TUFT OF RUSHES
AMONG THOSE GREENSCUMMED PITS AND FOUL QUAGMIRES WHICH BARRED THE
WAY TO THE STRANGER RANK REEDS AND LUSH SLIMY WATERPLANTS SENT AN
ODOUR OF DECAY AND A HEAVY MIASMATIC VAPOUR ONTO OUR FACES WHILE A
FALSE STEP PLUNGED US MORE THAN ONCE THIGHDEEP INTO THE DARK
QUIVERING MIRE WHICH SHOOK FOR YARDS IN SOFT UNDULATIONS AROUND OUR
FEET ITS TENACIOUS GRIP PLUCKED AT OUR HEELS AS WE WALKED AND WHEN
WE SANK INTO IT IT WAS AS IF SOME MALIGNANT HAND WAS TUGGING US DOWN
INTO THOSE OBSCENE DEPTHS SO GRIM AND PURPOSEFUL WAS THE CLUTCH IN
WHICH IT HELD US ONCE ONLY WE SAW A TRACE THAT SOMEONE HAD PASSED
THAT PERILOUS WAY BEFORE US FROM AMID A TUFT OF COTTON GRASS WHICH
BORE IT UP OUT OF THE SLIME SOME DARK THING WAS PROJECTING HOLMES
SANK TO HIS WAIST AS HE STEPPED FROM THE PATH TO SEIZE IT AND HAD WE
NOT BEEN THERE TO DRAG HIM OUT HE COULD NEVER HAVE SET HIS FOOT UPON
FIRM LAND AGAIN HE HELD AN OLD BLACK BOOT IN THE AIR MEYERS
TORONTO WAS PRINTED ON THE LEATHER INSIDE
IT IS WORTH A MUD BATH SAID HE IT IS OUR FRIEND SIR HENRYS
MISSING BOOT
THROWN THERE BY STAPLETON IN HIS FLIGHT
EXACTLY HE RETAINED IT IN HIS HAND AFTER USING IT TO SET THE HOUND
UPON THE TRACK HE FLED WHEN HE KNEW THE GAME WAS UP STILL CLUTCHING
IT AND HE HURLED IT AWAY AT THIS POINT OF HIS FLIGHT WE KNOW AT
LEAST THAT HE CAME SO FAR IN SAFETY
BUT MORE THAN THAT WE WERE NEVER DESTINED TO KNOW THOUGH THERE WAS
MUCH WHICH WE MIGHT SURMISE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF FINDING FOOTSTEPS
IN THE MIRE FOR THE RISING MUD OOZED SWIFTLY IN UPON THEM BUT AS WE
AT LAST REACHED FIRMER GROUND BEYOND THE MORASS WE ALL LOOKED EAGERLY
FOR THEM BUT NO SLIGHTEST SIGN OF THEM EVER MET OUR EYES IF THE
EARTH TOLD A TRUE STORY THEN STAPLETON NEVER REACHED THAT ISLAND OF
REFUGE TOWARDS WHICH HE STRUGGLED THROUGH THE FOG UPON THAT LAST
NIGHT SOMEWHERE IN THE HEART OF THE GREAT GRIMPEN MIRE DOWN IN THE
FOUL SLIME OF THE HUGE MORASS WHICH HAD SUCKED HIM IN THIS COLD AND
CRUELHEARTED MAN IS FOREVER BURIED
MANY TRACES WE FOUND OF HIM IN THE BOGGIRT ISLAND WHERE HE HAD HID
HIS SAVAGE ALLY A HUGE DRIVINGWHEEL AND A SHAFT HALFFILLED WITH
RUBBISH SHOWED THE POSITION OF AN ABANDONED MINE BESIDE IT WERE THE
CRUMBLING REMAINS OF THE COTTAGES OF THE MINERS DRIVEN AWAY NO DOUBT
BY THE FOUL REEK OF THE SURROUNDING SWAMP IN ONE OF THESE A STAPLE
AND CHAIN WITH A QUANTITY OF GNAWED BONES SHOWED WHERE THE ANIMAL HAD
BEEN CONFINED A SKELETON WITH A TANGLE OF BROWN HAIR ADHERING TO IT
LAY AMONG THE DEBRIS
A DOG SAID HOLMES BY JOVE A CURLYHAIRED SPANIEL POOR MORTIMER
WILL NEVER SEE HIS PET AGAIN WELL I DO NOT KNOW THAT THIS PLACE
CONTAINS ANY SECRET WHICH WE HAVE NOT ALREADY FATHOMED HE COULD HIDE
HIS HOUND BUT HE COULD NOT HUSH ITS VOICE AND HENCE CAME THOSE
CRIES WHICH EVEN IN DAYLIGHT WERE NOT PLEASANT TO HEAR ON AN
EMERGENCY HE COULD KEEP THE HOUND IN THE OUTHOUSE AT MERRIPIT BUT
IT WAS ALWAYS A RISK AND IT WAS ONLY ON THE SUPREME DAY WHICH HE
REGARDED AS THE END OF ALL HIS EFFORTS THAT HE DARED DO IT THIS
PASTE IN THE TIN IS NO DOUBT THE LUMINOUS MIXTURE WITH WHICH THE
CREATURE WAS DAUBED IT WAS SUGGESTED OF COURSE BY THE STORY OF THE
FAMILY HELLHOUND AND BY THE DESIRE TO FRIGHTEN OLD SIR CHARLES TO
DEATH NO WONDER THE POOR DEVIL OF A CONVICT RAN AND SCREAMED EVEN
AS OUR FRIEND DID AND AS WE OURSELVES MIGHT HAVE DONE WHEN HE SAW
SUCH A CREATURE BOUNDING THROUGH THE DARKNESS OF THE MOOR UPON HIS
TRACK IT WAS A CUNNING DEVICE FOR APART FROM THE CHANCE OF DRIVING
YOUR VICTIM TO HIS DEATH WHAT PEASANT WOULD VENTURE TO INQUIRE TOO
CLOSELY INTO SUCH A CREATURE SHOULD HE GET SIGHT OF IT AS MANY HAVE
DONE UPON THE MOOR I SAID IT IN LONDON WATSON AND I SAY IT AGAIN
NOW THAT NEVER YET HAVE WE HELPED TO HUNT DOWN A MORE DANGEROUS MAN
THAN HE WHO IS LYING YONDERHE SWEPT HIS LONG ARM TOWARDS THE HUGE
MOTTLED EXPANSE OF GREENSPLOTCHED BOG WHICH STRETCHED AWAY UNTIL IT
MERGED INTO THE RUSSET SLOPES OF THE MOOR
CHAPTER XV
A RETROSPECTION
IT WAS THE END OF NOVEMBER AND HOLMES AND I SAT UPON A RAW AND FOGGY
NIGHT ON EITHER SIDE OF A BLAZING FIRE IN OUR SITTINGROOM IN BAKER
STREET SINCE THE TRAGIC UPSHOT OF OUR VISIT TO DEVONSHIRE HE HAD
BEEN ENGAGED IN TWO AFFAIRS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN THE FIRST OF
WHICH HE HAD EXPOSED THE ATROCIOUS CONDUCT OF COLONEL UPWOOD IN
CONNECTION WITH THE FAMOUS CARD SCANDAL OF THE NONPAREIL CLUB WHILE
IN THE SECOND HE HAD DEFENDED THE UNFORTUNATE MME MONTPENSIER FROM
THE CHARGE OF MURDER WHICH HUNG OVER HER IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEATH
OF HER STEPDAUGHTER MLLE CARERE THE YOUNG LADY WHO AS IT WILL BE
REMEMBERED WAS FOUND SIX MONTHS LATER ALIVE AND MARRIED IN NEW YORK
MY FRIEND WAS IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS OVER THE SUCCESS WHICH HAD
ATTENDED A SUCCESSION OF DIFFICULT AND IMPORTANT CASES SO THAT I WAS
ABLE TO INDUCE HIM TO DISCUSS THE DETAILS OF THE BASKERVILLE MYSTERY
I HAD WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR I WAS AWARE THAT HE
WOULD NEVER PERMIT CASES TO OVERLAP AND THAT HIS CLEAR AND LOGICAL
MIND WOULD NOT BE DRAWN FROM ITS PRESENT WORK TO DWELL UPON MEMORIES
OF THE PAST SIR HENRY AND DR MORTIMER WERE HOWEVER IN LONDON ON
THEIR WAY TO THAT LONG VOYAGE WHICH HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED FOR THE
RESTORATION OF HIS SHATTERED NERVES THEY HAD CALLED UPON US THAT
VERY AFTERNOON SO THAT IT WAS NATURAL THAT THE SUBJECT SHOULD COME
UP FOR DISCUSSION
THE WHOLE COURSE OF EVENTS SAID HOLMES FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF
THE MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF STAPLETON WAS SIMPLE AND DIRECT ALTHOUGH
TO US WHO HAD NO MEANS IN THE BEGINNING OF KNOWING THE MOTIVES OF
HIS ACTIONS AND COULD ONLY LEARN PART OF THE FACTS IT ALL APPEARED
EXCEEDINGLY COMPLEX I HAVE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF TWO CONVERSATIONS
WITH MRS STAPLETON AND THE CASE HAS NOW BEEN SO ENTIRELY CLEARED UP
THAT I AM NOT AWARE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING WHICH HAS REMAINED A
SECRET TO US YOU WILL FIND A FEW NOTES UPON THE MATTER UNDER THE
HEADING B IN MY INDEXED LIST OF CASES
PERHAPS YOU WOULD KINDLY GIVE ME A SKETCH OF THE COURSE OF EVENTS
FROM MEMORY
CERTAINLY THOUGH I CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT I CARRY ALL THE FACTS IN
MY MIND INTENSE MENTAL CONCENTRATION HAS A CURIOUS WAY OF BLOTTING
OUT WHAT HAS PASSED THE BARRISTER WHO HAS HIS CASE AT HIS FINGERS
ENDS AND IS ABLE TO ARGUE WITH AN EXPERT UPON HIS OWN SUBJECT FINDS
THAT A WEEK OR TWO OF THE COURTS WILL DRIVE IT ALL OUT OF HIS HEAD
ONCE MORE SO EACH OF MY CASES DISPLACES THE LAST AND MLLE CARERE
HAS BLURRED MY RECOLLECTION OF BASKERVILLE HALL TOMORROW SOME OTHER
LITTLE PROBLEM MAY BE SUBMITTED TO MY NOTICE WHICH WILL IN TURN
DISPOSSESS THE FAIR FRENCH LADY AND THE INFAMOUS UPWOOD SO FAR AS
THE CASE OF THE HOUND GOES HOWEVER I WILL GIVE YOU THE COURSE OF
EVENTS AS NEARLY AS I CAN AND YOU WILL SUGGEST ANYTHING WHICH I MAY
HAVE FORGOTTEN
MY INQUIRIES SHOW BEYOND ALL QUESTION THAT THE FAMILY PORTRAIT DID
NOT LIE AND THAT THIS FELLOW WAS INDEED A BASKERVILLE HE WAS A SON
OF THAT RODGER BASKERVILLE THE YOUNGER BROTHER OF SIR CHARLES WHO
FLED WITH A SINISTER REPUTATION TO SOUTH AMERICA WHERE HE WAS SAID
TO HAVE DIED UNMARRIED HE DID AS A MATTER OF FACT MARRY AND HAD
ONE CHILD THIS FELLOW WHOSE REAL NAME IS THE SAME AS HIS FATHERS
HE MARRIED BERYL GARCIA ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF COSTA RICA AND
HAVING PURLOINED A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF PUBLIC MONEY HE CHANGED HIS
NAME TO VANDELEUR AND FLED TO ENGLAND WHERE HE ESTABLISHED A SCHOOL
IN THE EAST OF YORKSHIRE HIS REASON FOR ATTEMPTING THIS SPECIAL LINE
OF BUSINESS WAS THAT HE HAD STRUCK UP AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH A
CONSUMPTIVE TUTOR UPON THE VOYAGE HOME AND THAT HE HAD USED THIS
MANS ABILITY TO MAKE THE UNDERTAKING A SUCCESS FRASER THE TUTOR
DIED HOWEVER AND THE SCHOOL WHICH HAD BEGUN WELL SANK FROM DISREPUTE
INTO INFAMY THE VANDELEURS FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO CHANGE THEIR NAME
TO STAPLETON AND HE BROUGHT THE REMAINS OF HIS FORTUNE HIS SCHEMES
FOR THE FUTURE AND HIS TASTE FOR ENTOMOLOGY TO THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
I LEARNED AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM THAT HE WAS A RECOGNIZED AUTHORITY
UPON THE SUBJECT AND THAT THE NAME OF VANDELEUR HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY
ATTACHED TO A CERTAIN MOTH WHICH HE HAD IN HIS YORKSHIRE DAYS BEEN
THE FIRST TO DESCRIBE
WE NOW COME TO THAT PORTION OF HIS LIFE WHICH HAS PROVED TO BE OF
SUCH INTENSE INTEREST TO US THE FELLOW HAD EVIDENTLY MADE INQUIRY
AND FOUND THAT ONLY TWO LIVES INTERVENED BETWEEN HIM AND A VALUABLE
ESTATE WHEN HE WENT TO DEVONSHIRE HIS PLANS WERE I BELIEVE
EXCEEDINGLY HAZY BUT THAT HE MEANT MISCHIEF FROM THE FIRST IS
EVIDENT FROM THE WAY IN WHICH HE TOOK HIS WIFE WITH HIM IN THE
CHARACTER OF HIS SISTER THE IDEA OF USING HER AS A DECOY WAS CLEARLY
ALREADY IN HIS MIND THOUGH HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN CERTAIN HOW THE
DETAILS OF HIS PLOT WERE TO BE ARRANGED HE MEANT IN THE END TO HAVE
THE ESTATE AND HE WAS READY TO USE ANY TOOL OR RUN ANY RISK FOR THAT
END HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF AS NEAR TO HIS ANCESTRAL
HOME AS HE COULD AND HIS SECOND WAS TO CULTIVATE A FRIENDSHIP WITH
SIR CHARLES BASKERVILLE AND WITH THE NEIGHBOURS
THE BARONET HIMSELF TOLD HIM ABOUT THE FAMILY HOUND AND SO PREPARED
THE WAY FOR HIS OWN DEATH STAPLETON AS I WILL CONTINUE TO CALL HIM
KNEW THAT THE OLD MANS HEART WAS WEAK AND THAT A SHOCK WOULD KILL
HIM SO MUCH HE HAD LEARNED FROM DR MORTIMER HE HAD HEARD ALSO THAT
SIR CHARLES WAS SUPERSTITIOUS AND HAD TAKEN THIS GRIM LEGEND VERY
SERIOUSLY HIS INGENIOUS MIND INSTANTLY SUGGESTED A WAY BY WHICH THE
BARONET COULD BE DONE TO DEATH AND YET IT WOULD BE HARDLY POSSIBLE
TO BRING HOME THE GUILT TO THE REAL MURDERER
HAVING CONCEIVED THE IDEA HE PROCEEDED TO CARRY IT OUT WITH
CONSIDERABLE FINESSE AN ORDINARY SCHEMER WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT TO
WORK WITH A SAVAGE HOUND THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL MEANS TO MAKE THE
CREATURE DIABOLICAL WAS A FLASH OF GENIUS UPON HIS PART THE DOG HE
BOUGHT IN LONDON FROM ROSS AND MANGLES THE DEALERS IN FULHAM ROAD
IT WAS THE STRONGEST AND MOST SAVAGE IN THEIR POSSESSION HE BROUGHT
IT DOWN BY THE NORTH DEVON LINE AND WALKED A GREAT DISTANCE OVER THE
MOOR SO AS TO GET IT HOME WITHOUT EXCITING ANY REMARKS HE HAD
ALREADY ON HIS INSECT HUNTS LEARNED TO PENETRATE THE GRIMPEN MIRE
AND SO HAD FOUND A SAFE HIDINGPLACE FOR THE CREATURE HERE HE
KENNELLED IT AND WAITED HIS CHANCE
BUT IT WAS SOME TIME COMING THE OLD GENTLEMAN COULD NOT BE DECOYED
OUTSIDE OF HIS GROUNDS AT NIGHT SEVERAL TIMES STAPLETON LURKED ABOUT
WITH HIS HOUND BUT WITHOUT AVAIL IT WAS DURING THESE FRUITLESS
QUESTS THAT HE OR RATHER HIS ALLY WAS SEEN BY PEASANTS AND THAT
THE LEGEND OF THE DEMON DOG RECEIVED A NEW CONFIRMATION HE HAD HOPED
THAT HIS WIFE MIGHT LURE SIR CHARLES TO HIS RUIN BUT HERE SHE PROVED
UNEXPECTEDLY INDEPENDENT SHE WOULD NOT ENDEAVOUR TO ENTANGLE THE OLD
GENTLEMAN IN A SENTIMENTAL ATTACHMENT WHICH MIGHT DELIVER HIM OVER TO
HIS ENEMY THREATS AND EVEN I AM SORRY TO SAY BLOWS REFUSED TO MOVE
HER SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND FOR A TIME STAPLETON
WAS AT A DEADLOCK
HE FOUND A WAY OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES THROUGH THE CHANCE THAT SIR
CHARLES WHO HAD CONCEIVED A FRIENDSHIP FOR HIM MADE HIM THE
MINISTER OF HIS CHARITY IN THE CASE OF THIS UNFORTUNATE WOMAN MRS
LAURA LYONS BY REPRESENTING HIMSELF AS A SINGLE MAN HE ACQUIRED
COMPLETE INFLUENCE OVER HER AND HE GAVE HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN
THE EVENT OF HER OBTAINING A DIVORCE FROM HER HUSBAND HE WOULD MARRY
HER HIS PLANS WERE SUDDENLY BROUGHT TO A HEAD BY HIS KNOWLEDGE THAT
SIR CHARLES WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE HALL ON THE ADVICE OF DR
MORTIMER WITH WHOSE OPINION HE HIMSELF PRETENDED TO COINCIDE HE
MUST ACT AT ONCE OR HIS VICTIM MIGHT GET BEYOND HIS POWER HE
THEREFORE PUT PRESSURE UPON MRS LYONS TO WRITE THIS LETTER
IMPLORING THE OLD MAN TO GIVE HER AN INTERVIEW ON THE EVENING BEFORE
HIS DEPARTURE FOR LONDON HE THEN BY A SPECIOUS ARGUMENT PREVENTED
HER FROM GOING AND SO HAD THE CHANCE FOR WHICH HE HAD WAITED
DRIVING BACK IN THE EVENING FROM COOMBE TRACEY HE WAS IN TIME TO GET
HIS HOUND TO TREAT IT WITH HIS INFERNAL PAINT AND TO BRING THE
BEAST ROUND TO THE GATE AT WHICH HE HAD REASON TO EXPECT THAT HE
WOULD FIND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAITING THE DOG INCITED BY ITS MASTER
SPRANG OVER THE WICKETGATE AND PURSUED THE UNFORTUNATE BARONET WHO
FLED SCREAMING DOWN THE YEW ALLEY IN THAT GLOOMY TUNNEL IT MUST
INDEED HAVE BEEN A DREADFUL SIGHT TO SEE THAT HUGE BLACK CREATURE
WITH ITS FLAMING JAWS AND BLAZING EYES BOUNDING AFTER ITS VICTIM HE
FELL DEAD AT THE END OF THE ALLEY FROM HEART DISEASE AND TERROR THE
HOUND HAD KEPT UPON THE GRASSY BORDER WHILE THE BARONET HAD RUN DOWN
THE PATH SO THAT NO TRACK BUT THE MANS WAS VISIBLE ON SEEING HIM
LYING STILL THE CREATURE HAD PROBABLY APPROACHED TO SNIFF AT HIM BUT
FINDING HIM DEAD HAD TURNED AWAY AGAIN IT WAS THEN THAT IT LEFT THE
PRINT WHICH WAS ACTUALLY OBSERVED BY DR MORTIMER THE HOUND WAS
CALLED OFF AND HURRIED AWAY TO ITS LAIR IN THE GRIMPEN MIRE AND A
MYSTERY WAS LEFT WHICH PUZZLED THE AUTHORITIES ALARMED THE
COUNTRYSIDE AND FINALLY BROUGHT THE CASE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF OUR
OBSERVATION
SO MUCH FOR THE DEATH OF SIR CHARLES BASKERVILLE YOU PERCEIVE THE
DEVILISH CUNNING OF IT FOR REALLY IT WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO
MAKE A CASE AGAINST THE REAL MURDERER HIS ONLY ACCOMPLICE WAS ONE
WHO COULD NEVER GIVE HIM AWAY AND THE GROTESQUE INCONCEIVABLE
NATURE OF THE DEVICE ONLY SERVED TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE BOTH OF
THE WOMEN CONCERNED IN THE CASE MRS STAPLETON AND MRS LAURA LYONS
WERE LEFT WITH A STRONG SUSPICION AGAINST STAPLETON MRS STAPLETON
KNEW THAT HE HAD DESIGNS UPON THE OLD MAN AND ALSO OF THE EXISTENCE
OF THE HOUND MRS LYONS KNEW NEITHER OF THESE THINGS BUT HAD BEEN
IMPRESSED BY THE DEATH OCCURRING AT THE TIME OF AN UNCANCELLED
APPOINTMENT WHICH WAS ONLY KNOWN TO HIM HOWEVER BOTH OF THEM WERE
UNDER HIS INFLUENCE AND HE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THEM THE FIRST
HALF OF HIS TASK WAS SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED BUT THE MORE DIFFICULT
STILL REMAINED
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT STAPLETON DID NOT KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF AN
HEIR IN CANADA IN ANY CASE HE WOULD VERY SOON LEARN IT FROM HIS
FRIEND DR MORTIMER AND HE WAS TOLD BY THE LATTER ALL DETAILS ABOUT
THE ARRIVAL OF HENRY BASKERVILLE STAPLETONS FIRST IDEA WAS THAT
THIS YOUNG STRANGER FROM CANADA MIGHT POSSIBLY BE DONE TO DEATH IN
LONDON WITHOUT COMING DOWN TO DEVONSHIRE AT ALL HE DISTRUSTED HIS
WIFE EVER SINCE SHE HAD REFUSED TO HELP HIM IN LAYING A TRAP FOR THE
OLD MAN AND HE DARED NOT LEAVE HER LONG OUT OF HIS SIGHT FOR FEAR HE
SHOULD LOSE HIS INFLUENCE OVER HER IT WAS FOR THIS REASON THAT HE
TOOK HER TO LONDON WITH HIM THEY LODGED I FIND AT THE MEXBOROUGH
PRIVATE HOTEL IN CRAVEN STREET WHICH WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THOSE
CALLED UPON BY MY AGENT IN SEARCH OF EVIDENCE HERE HE KEPT HIS WIFE
IMPRISONED IN HER ROOM WHILE HE DISGUISED IN A BEARD FOLLOWED DR
MORTIMER TO BAKER STREET AND AFTERWARDS TO THE STATION AND TO THE
NORTHUMBERLAND HOTEL HIS WIFE HAD SOME INKLING OF HIS PLANS BUT SHE
HAD SUCH A FEAR OF HER HUSBANDA FEAR FOUNDED UPON BRUTAL
ILLTREATMENTTHAT SHE DARE NOT WRITE TO WARN THE MAN WHOM SHE KNEW
TO BE IN DANGER IF THE LETTER SHOULD FALL INTO STAPLETONS HANDS HER
OWN LIFE WOULD NOT BE SAFE EVENTUALLY AS WE KNOW SHE ADOPTED THE
EXPEDIENT OF CUTTING OUT THE WORDS WHICH WOULD FORM THE MESSAGE AND
ADDRESSING THE LETTER IN A DISGUISED HAND IT REACHED THE BARONET
AND GAVE HIM THE FIRST WARNING OF HIS DANGER
IT WAS VERY ESSENTIAL FOR STAPLETON TO GET SOME ARTICLE OF SIR
HENRYS ATTIRE SO THAT IN CASE HE WAS DRIVEN TO USE THE DOG HE
MIGHT ALWAYS HAVE THE MEANS OF SETTING HIM UPON HIS TRACK WITH
CHARACTERISTIC PROMPTNESS AND AUDACITY HE SET ABOUT THIS AT ONCE AND
WE CANNOT DOUBT THAT THE BOOTS OR CHAMBERMAID OF THE HOTEL WAS WELL
BRIBED TO HELP HIM IN HIS DESIGN BY CHANCE HOWEVER THE FIRST BOOT
WHICH WAS PROCURED FOR HIM WAS A NEW ONE AND THEREFORE USELESS FOR
HIS PURPOSE HE THEN HAD IT RETURNED AND OBTAINED ANOTHERA MOST
INSTRUCTIVE INCIDENT SINCE IT PROVED CONCLUSIVELY TO MY MIND THAT WE
WERE DEALING WITH A REAL HOUND AS NO OTHER SUPPOSITION COULD EXPLAIN
THIS ANXIETY TO OBTAIN AN OLD BOOT AND THIS INDIFFERENCE TO A NEW
ONE THE MORE OUTR AND GROTESQUE AN INCIDENT IS THE MORE CAREFULLY
IT DESERVES TO BE EXAMINED AND THE VERY POINT WHICH APPEARS TO
COMPLICATE A CASE IS WHEN DULY CONSIDERED AND SCIENTIFICALLY
HANDLED THE ONE WHICH IS MOST LIKELY TO ELUCIDATE IT
THEN WE HAD THE VISIT FROM OUR FRIENDS NEXT MORNING SHADOWED ALWAYS
BY STAPLETON IN THE CAB FROM HIS KNOWLEDGE OF OUR ROOMS AND OF MY
APPEARANCE AS WELL AS FROM HIS GENERAL CONDUCT I AM INCLINED TO
THINK THAT STAPLETONS CAREER OF CRIME HAS BEEN BY NO MEANS LIMITED
TO THIS SINGLE BASKERVILLE AFFAIR IT IS SUGGESTIVE THAT DURING THE
LAST THREE YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR CONSIDERABLE BURGLARIES IN THE
WEST COUNTRY FOR NONE OF WHICH WAS ANY CRIMINAL EVER ARRESTED THE
LAST OF THESE AT FOLKESTONE COURT IN MAY WAS REMARKABLE FOR THE
COLDBLOODED PISTOLING OF THE PAGE WHO SURPRISED THE MASKED AND
SOLITARY BURGLAR I CANNOT DOUBT THAT STAPLETON RECRUITED HIS WANING
RESOURCES IN THIS FASHION AND THAT FOR YEARS HE HAS BEEN A DESPERATE
AND DANGEROUS MAN
WE HAD AN EXAMPLE OF HIS READINESS OF RESOURCE THAT MORNING WHEN HE
GOT AWAY FROM US SO SUCCESSFULLY AND ALSO OF HIS AUDACITY IN SENDING
BACK MY OWN NAME TO ME THROUGH THE CABMAN FROM THAT MOMENT HE
UNDERSTOOD THAT I HAD TAKEN OVER THE CASE IN LONDON AND THAT
THEREFORE THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIM THERE HE RETURNED TO DARTMOOR
AND AWAITED THE ARRIVAL OF THE BARONET
ONE MOMENT SAID I YOU HAVE NO DOUBT DESCRIBED THE SEQUENCE OF
EVENTS CORRECTLY BUT THERE IS ONE POINT WHICH YOU HAVE LEFT
UNEXPLAINED WHAT BECAME OF THE HOUND WHEN ITS MASTER WAS IN LONDON
I HAVE GIVEN SOME ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER AND IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY OF
IMPORTANCE THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION THAT STAPLETON HAD A CONFIDANT
THOUGH IT IS UNLIKELY THAT HE EVER PLACED HIMSELF IN HIS POWER BY
SHARING ALL HIS PLANS WITH HIM THERE WAS AN OLD MANSERVANT AT
MERRIPIT HOUSE WHOSE NAME WAS ANTHONY HIS CONNECTION WITH THE
STAPLETONS CAN BE TRACED FOR SEVERAL YEARS AS FAR BACK AS THE
SCHOOLMASTERING DAYS SO THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT HIS MASTER
AND MISTRESS WERE REALLY HUSBAND AND WIFE THIS MAN HAS DISAPPEARED
AND HAS ESCAPED FROM THE COUNTRY IT IS SUGGESTIVE THAT ANTHONY IS
NOT A COMMON NAME IN ENGLAND WHILE ANTONIO IS SO IN ALL SPANISH OR
SPANISHAMERICAN COUNTRIES THE MAN LIKE MRS STAPLETON HERSELF
SPOKE GOOD ENGLISH BUT WITH A CURIOUS LISPING ACCENT I HAVE MYSELF
SEEN THIS OLD MAN CROSS THE GRIMPEN MIRE BY THE PATH WHICH STAPLETON
HAD MARKED OUT IT IS VERY PROBABLE THEREFORE THAT IN THE ABSENCE
OF HIS MASTER IT WAS HE WHO CARED FOR THE HOUND THOUGH HE MAY NEVER
HAVE KNOWN THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE BEAST WAS USED
THE STAPLETONS THEN WENT DOWN TO DEVONSHIRE WHITHER THEY WERE SOON
FOLLOWED BY SIR HENRY AND YOU ONE WORD NOW AS TO HOW I STOOD MYSELF
AT THAT TIME IT MAY POSSIBLY RECUR TO YOUR MEMORY THAT WHEN I
EXAMINED THE PAPER UPON WHICH THE PRINTED WORDS WERE FASTENED I MADE
A CLOSE INSPECTION FOR THE WATERMARK IN DOING SO I HELD IT WITHIN A
FEW INCHES OF MY EYES AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FAINT SMELL OF THE
SCENT KNOWN AS WHITE JESSAMINE THERE ARE SEVENTYFIVE PERFUMES
WHICH IT IS VERY NECESSARY THAT A CRIMINAL EXPERT SHOULD BE ABLE TO
DISTINGUISH FROM EACH OTHER AND CASES HAVE MORE THAN ONCE WITHIN MY
OWN EXPERIENCE DEPENDED UPON THEIR PROMPT RECOGNITION THE SCENT
SUGGESTED THE PRESENCE OF A LADY AND ALREADY MY THOUGHTS BEGAN TO
TURN TOWARDS THE STAPLETONS THUS I HAD MADE CERTAIN OF THE HOUND
AND HAD GUESSED AT THE CRIMINAL BEFORE EVER WE WENT TO THE WEST
COUNTRY
IT WAS MY GAME TO WATCH STAPLETON IT WAS EVIDENT HOWEVER THAT I
COULD NOT DO THIS IF I WERE WITH YOU SINCE HE WOULD BE KEENLY ON HIS
GUARD I DECEIVED EVERYBODY THEREFORE YOURSELF INCLUDED AND I CAME
DOWN SECRETLY WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN LONDON MY HARDSHIPS WERE
NOT SO GREAT AS YOU IMAGINED THOUGH SUCH TRIFLING DETAILS MUST NEVER
INTERFERE WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF A CASE I STAYED FOR THE MOST
PART AT COOMBE TRACEY AND ONLY USED THE HUT UPON THE MOOR WHEN IT
WAS NECESSARY TO BE NEAR THE SCENE OF ACTION CARTWRIGHT HAD COME
DOWN WITH ME AND IN HIS DISGUISE AS A COUNTRY BOY HE WAS OF GREAT
ASSISTANCE TO ME I WAS DEPENDENT UPON HIM FOR FOOD AND CLEAN LINEN
WHEN I WAS WATCHING STAPLETON CARTWRIGHT WAS FREQUENTLY WATCHING
YOU SO THAT I WAS ABLE TO KEEP MY HAND UPON ALL THE STRINGS
I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT YOUR REPORTS REACHED ME RAPIDLY BEING
FORWARDED INSTANTLY FROM BAKER STREET TO COOMBE TRACEY THEY WERE OF
GREAT SERVICE TO ME AND ESPECIALLY THAT ONE INCIDENTALLY TRUTHFUL
PIECE OF BIOGRAPHY OF STAPLETONS I WAS ABLE TO ESTABLISH THE
IDENTITY OF THE MAN AND THE WOMAN AND KNEW AT LAST EXACTLY HOW I
STOOD THE CASE HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLY COMPLICATED THROUGH THE
INCIDENT OF THE ESCAPED CONVICT AND THE RELATIONS BETWEEN HIM AND THE
BARRYMORES THIS ALSO YOU CLEARED UP IN A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY THOUGH
I HAD ALREADY COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSIONS FROM MY OWN OBSERVATIONS
BY THE TIME THAT YOU DISCOVERED ME UPON THE MOOR I HAD A COMPLETE
KNOWLEDGE OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS BUT I HAD NOT A CASE WHICH COULD GO
TO A JURY EVEN STAPLETONS ATTEMPT UPON SIR HENRY THAT NIGHT WHICH
ENDED IN THE DEATH OF THE UNFORTUNATE CONVICT DID NOT HELP US MUCH IN
PROVING MURDER AGAINST OUR MAN THERE SEEMED TO BE NO ALTERNATIVE BUT
TO CATCH HIM REDHANDED AND TO DO SO WE HAD TO USE SIR HENRY ALONE
AND APPARENTLY UNPROTECTED AS A BAIT WE DID SO AND AT THE COST OF
A SEVERE SHOCK TO OUR CLIENT WE SUCCEEDED IN COMPLETING OUR CASE AND
DRIVING STAPLETON TO HIS DESTRUCTION THAT SIR HENRY SHOULD HAVE BEEN
EXPOSED TO THIS IS I MUST CONFESS A REPROACH TO MY MANAGEMENT OF
THE CASE BUT WE HAD NO MEANS OF FORESEEING THE TERRIBLE AND
PARALYZING SPECTACLE WHICH THE BEAST PRESENTED NOR COULD WE PREDICT
THE FOG WHICH ENABLED HIM TO BURST UPON US AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE WE
SUCCEEDED IN OUR OBJECT AT A COST WHICH BOTH THE SPECIALIST AND DR
MORTIMER ASSURE ME WILL BE A TEMPORARY ONE A LONG JOURNEY MAY ENABLE
OUR FRIEND TO RECOVER NOT ONLY FROM HIS SHATTERED NERVES BUT ALSO
FROM HIS WOUNDED FEELINGS HIS LOVE FOR THE LADY WAS DEEP AND
SINCERE AND TO HIM THE SADDEST PART OF ALL THIS BLACK BUSINESS WAS
THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BY HER
IT ONLY REMAINS TO INDICATE THE PART WHICH SHE HAD PLAYED
THROUGHOUT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT STAPLETON EXERCISED AN
INFLUENCE OVER HER WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN LOVE OR MAY HAVE BEEN FEAR OR
VERY POSSIBLY BOTH SINCE THEY ARE BY NO MEANS INCOMPATIBLE EMOTIONS
IT WAS AT LEAST ABSOLUTELY EFFECTIVE AT HIS COMMAND SHE CONSENTED
TO PASS AS HIS SISTER THOUGH HE FOUND THE LIMITS OF HIS POWER OVER
HER WHEN HE ENDEAVOURED TO MAKE HER THE DIRECT ACCESSORY TO MURDER
SHE WAS READY TO WARN SIR HENRY SO FAR AS SHE COULD WITHOUT
IMPLICATING HER HUSBAND AND AGAIN AND AGAIN SHE TRIED TO DO SO
STAPLETON HIMSELF SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF JEALOUSY AND WHEN HE
SAW THE BARONET PAYING COURT TO THE LADY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS PART OF
HIS OWN PLAN STILL HE COULD NOT HELP INTERRUPTING WITH A PASSIONATE
OUTBURST WHICH REVEALED THE FIERY SOUL WHICH HIS SELFCONTAINED
MANNER SO CLEVERLY CONCEALED BY ENCOURAGING THE INTIMACY HE MADE IT
CERTAIN THAT SIR HENRY WOULD FREQUENTLY COME TO MERRIPIT HOUSE AND
THAT HE WOULD SOONER OR LATER GET THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH HE DESIRED
ON THE DAY OF THE CRISIS HOWEVER HIS WIFE TURNED SUDDENLY AGAINST
HIM SHE HAD LEARNED SOMETHING OF THE DEATH OF THE CONVICT AND SHE
KNEW THAT THE HOUND WAS BEING KEPT IN THE OUTHOUSE ON THE EVENING
THAT SIR HENRY WAS COMING TO DINNER SHE TAXED HER HUSBAND WITH HIS
INTENDED CRIME AND A FURIOUS SCENE FOLLOWED IN WHICH HE SHOWED HER
FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE HAD A RIVAL IN HIS LOVE HER FIDELITY
TURNED IN AN INSTANT TO BITTER HATRED AND HE SAW THAT SHE WOULD
BETRAY HIM HE TIED HER UP THEREFORE THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE NO CHANCE
OF WARNING SIR HENRY AND HE HOPED NO DOUBT THAT WHEN THE WHOLE
COUNTRYSIDE PUT DOWN THE BARONETS DEATH TO THE CURSE OF HIS FAMILY
AS THEY CERTAINLY WOULD DO HE COULD WIN HIS WIFE BACK TO ACCEPT AN
ACCOMPLISHED FACT AND TO KEEP SILENT UPON WHAT SHE KNEW IN THIS I
FANCY THAT IN ANY CASE HE MADE A MISCALCULATION AND THAT IF WE HAD
NOT BEEN THERE HIS DOOM WOULD NONE THE LESS HAVE BEEN SEALED A
WOMAN OF SPANISH BLOOD DOES NOT CONDONE SUCH AN INJURY SO LIGHTLY
AND NOW MY DEAR WATSON WITHOUT REFERRING TO MY NOTES I CANNOT GIVE
YOU A MORE DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THIS CURIOUS CASE I DO NOT KNOW THAT
ANYTHING ESSENTIAL HAS BEEN LEFT UNEXPLAINED
HE COULD NOT HOPE TO FRIGHTEN SIR HENRY TO DEATH AS HE HAD DONE THE
OLD UNCLE WITH HIS BOGIE HOUND
THE BEAST WAS SAVAGE AND HALFSTARVED IF ITS APPEARANCE DID NOT
FRIGHTEN ITS VICTIM TO DEATH AT LEAST IT WOULD PARALYZE THE
RESISTANCE WHICH MIGHT BE OFFERED
NO DOUBT THERE ONLY REMAINS ONE DIFFICULTY IF STAPLETON CAME INTO
THE SUCCESSION HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN THE FACT THAT HE THE HEIR HAD
BEEN LIVING UNANNOUNCED UNDER ANOTHER NAME SO CLOSE TO THE PROPERTY
HOW COULD HE CLAIM IT WITHOUT CAUSING SUSPICION AND INQUIRY
IT IS A FORMIDABLE DIFFICULTY AND I FEAR THAT YOU ASK TOO MUCH WHEN
YOU EXPECT ME TO SOLVE IT THE PAST AND THE PRESENT ARE WITHIN THE
FIELD OF MY INQUIRY BUT WHAT A MAN MAY DO IN THE FUTURE IS A HARD
QUESTION TO ANSWER MRS STAPLETON HAS HEARD HER HUSBAND DISCUSS THE
PROBLEM ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THERE WERE THREE POSSIBLE COURSES HE
MIGHT CLAIM THE PROPERTY FROM SOUTH AMERICA ESTABLISH HIS IDENTITY
BEFORE THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES THERE AND SO OBTAIN THE FORTUNE
WITHOUT EVER COMING TO ENGLAND AT ALL OR HE MIGHT ADOPT AN ELABORATE
DISGUISE DURING THE SHORT TIME THAT HE NEED BE IN LONDON OR AGAIN
HE MIGHT FURNISH AN ACCOMPLICE WITH THE PROOFS AND PAPERS PUTTING
HIM IN AS HEIR AND RETAINING A CLAIM UPON SOME PROPORTION OF HIS
INCOME WE CANNOT DOUBT FROM WHAT WE KNOW OF HIM THAT HE WOULD HAVE
FOUND SOME WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY AND NOW MY DEAR WATSON WE
HAVE HAD SOME WEEKS OF SEVERE WORK AND FOR ONE EVENING I THINK WE
MAY TURN OUR THOUGHTS INTO MORE PLEASANT CHANNELS I HAVE A BOX FOR
LES HUGUENOTS HAVE YOU HEARD THE DE RESZKES MIGHT I TROUBLE YOU
THEN TO BE READY IN HALF AN HOUR AND WE CAN STOP AT MARCINIS FOR A
LITTLE DINNER ON THE WAY

THE WARNING
I AM INCLINED TO THINK SAID I
I SHOULD DO SO SHERLOCK HOLMES REMARKED IMPATIENTLY
I BELIEVE THAT I AM ONE OF THE MOST LONGSUFFERING OF MORTALS BUT
ILL ADMIT THAT I WAS ANNOYED AT THE SARDONIC INTERRUPTION
REALLY HOLMES SAID I SEVERELY YOU ARE A LITTLE TRYING AT
TIMES
HE WAS TOO MUCH ABSORBED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO GIVE ANY IMMEDIATE
ANSWER TO MY REMONSTRANCE HE LEANED UPON HIS HAND WITH HIS UNTASTED
BREAKFAST BEFORE HIM AND HE STARED AT THE SLIP OF PAPER WHICH HE HAD
JUST DRAWN FROM ITS ENVELOPE THEN HE TOOK THE ENVELOPE ITSELF HELD
IT UP TO THE LIGHT AND VERY CAREFULLY STUDIED BOTH THE EXTERIOR AND
THE FLAP
IT IS PORLOCKS WRITING SAID HE THOUGHTFULLY I CAN HARDLY DOUBT
THAT IT IS PORLOCKS WRITING THOUGH I HAVE SEEN IT ONLY TWICE
BEFORE THE GREEK E WITH THE PECULIAR TOP FLOURISH IS DISTINCTIVE
BUT IF IT IS PORLOCK THEN IT MUST BE SOMETHING OF THE VERY FIRST
IMPORTANCE
HE WAS SPEAKING TO HIMSELF RATHER THAN TO ME BUT MY VEXATION
DISAPPEARED IN THE INTEREST WHICH THE WORDS AWAKENED
WHO THEN IS PORLOCK I ASKED
PORLOCK WATSON IS A NOMDEPLUME A MERE IDENTIFICATION MARK BUT
BEHIND IT LIES A SHIFTY AND EVASIVE PERSONALITY IN A FORMER LETTER
HE FRANKLY INFORMED ME THAT THE NAME WAS NOT HIS OWN AND DEFIED ME
EVER TO TRACE HIM AMONG THE TEEMING MILLIONS OF THIS GREAT CITY
PORLOCK IS IMPORTANT NOT FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR THE GREAT MAN WITH
WHOM HE IS IN TOUCH PICTURE TO YOURSELF THE PILOT FISH WITH THE
SHARK THE JACKAL WITH THE LIONANYTHING THAT IS INSIGNIFICANT IN
COMPANIONSHIP WITH WHAT IS FORMIDABLE NOT ONLY FORMIDABLE WATSON
BUT SINISTERIN THE HIGHEST DEGREE SINISTER THAT IS WHERE HE COMES
WITHIN MY PURVIEW YOU HAVE HEARD ME SPEAK OF PROFESSOR MORIARTY
THE FAMOUS SCIENTIFIC CRIMINAL AS FAMOUS AMONG CROOKS AS
MY BLUSHES WATSON HOLMES MURMURED IN A DEPRECATING VOICE
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY AS HE IS UNKNOWN TO THE PUBLIC
A TOUCH A DISTINCT TOUCH CRIED HOLMES YOU ARE DEVELOPING A
CERTAIN UNEXPECTED VEIN OF PAWKY HUMOUR WATSON AGAINST WHICH I MUST
LEARN TO GUARD MYSELF BUT IN CALLING MORIARTY A CRIMINAL YOU ARE
UTTERING LIBEL IN THE EYES OF THE LAWAND THERE LIE THE GLORY AND
THE WONDER OF IT THE GREATEST SCHEMER OF ALL TIME THE ORGANIZER OF
EVERY DEVILTRY THE CONTROLLING BRAIN OF THE UNDERWORLD A BRAIN
WHICH MIGHT HAVE MADE OR MARRED THE DESTINY OF NATIONSTHATS THE
MAN BUT SO ALOOF IS HE FROM GENERAL SUSPICION SO IMMUNE FROM
CRITICISM SO ADMIRABLE IN HIS MANAGEMENT AND SELFEFFACEMENT THAT
FOR THOSE VERY WORDS THAT YOU HAVE UTTERED HE COULD HALE YOU TO A
COURT AND EMERGE WITH YOUR YEARS PENSION AS A SOLATIUM FOR HIS
WOUNDED CHARACTER IS HE NOT THE CELEBRATED AUTHOR OF THE DYNAMICS OF
AN ASTEROID A BOOK WHICH ASCENDS TO SUCH RAREFIED HEIGHTS OF PURE
MATHEMATICS THAT IT IS SAID THAT THERE WAS NO MAN IN THE SCIENTIFIC
PRESS CAPABLE OF CRITICIZING IT IS THIS A MAN TO TRADUCE
FOULMOUTHED DOCTOR AND SLANDERED PROFESSORSUCH WOULD BE YOUR
RESPECTIVE ROLES THATS GENIUS WATSON BUT IF I AM SPARED BY LESSER
MEN OUR DAY WILL SURELY COME
MAY I BE THERE TO SEE I EXCLAIMED DEVOUTLY BUT YOU WERE SPEAKING
OF THIS MAN PORLOCK
AH YESTHE SOCALLED PORLOCK IS A LINK IN THE CHAIN SOME LITTLE
WAY FROM ITS GREAT ATTACHMENT PORLOCK IS NOT QUITE A SOUND
LINKBETWEEN OURSELVES HE IS THE ONLY FLAW IN THAT CHAIN SO FAR AS
I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TEST IT
BUT NO CHAIN IS STRONGER THAN ITS WEAKEST LINK
EXACTLY MY DEAR WATSON HENCE THE EXTREME IMPORTANCE OF PORLOCK
LED ON BY SOME RUDIMENTARY ASPIRATIONS TOWARDS RIGHT AND ENCOURAGED
BY THE JUDICIOUS STIMULATION OF AN OCCASIONAL TENPOUND NOTE SENT TO
HIM BY DEVIOUS METHODS HE HAS ONCE OR TWICE GIVEN ME ADVANCE
INFORMATION WHICH HAS BEEN OF VALUETHAT HIGHEST VALUE WHICH
ANTICIPATES AND PREVENTS RATHER THAN AVENGES CRIME I CANNOT DOUBT
THAT IF WE HAD THE CIPHER WE SHOULD FIND THAT THIS COMMUNICATION IS
OF THE NATURE THAT I INDICATE
AGAIN HOLMES FLATTENED OUT THE PAPER UPON HIS UNUSED PLATE I ROSE
AND LEANING OVER HIM STARED DOWN AT THE CURIOUS INSCRIPTION WHICH
RAN AS FOLLOWS
C DOUGLAS BIRLSTONE
BIRLSTONE WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT HOLMES
IT IS OBVIOUSLY AN ATTEMPT TO CONVEY SECRET INFORMATION
BUT WHAT IS THE USE OF A CIPHER MESSAGE WITHOUT THE CIPHER
IN THIS INSTANCE NONE AT ALL
WHY DO YOU SAY IN THIS INSTANCE
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY CIPHERS WHICH I WOULD READ AS EASILY AS I DO
THE APOCRYPHA OF THE AGONY COLUMN SUCH CRUDE DEVICES AMUSE THE
INTELLIGENCE WITHOUT FATIGUING IT BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT IT IS
CLEARLY A REFERENCE TO THE WORDS IN A PAGE OF SOME BOOK UNTIL I AM
TOLD WHICH PAGE AND WHICH BOOK I AM POWERLESS
BUT WHY DOUGLAS AND BIRLSTONE
CLEARLY BECAUSE THOSE ARE WORDS WHICH WERE NOT CONTAINED IN THE PAGE
IN QUESTION
THEN WHY HAS HE NOT INDICATED THE BOOK
YOUR NATIVE SHREWDNESS MY DEAR WATSON THAT INNATE CUNNING WHICH IS
THE DELIGHT OF YOUR FRIENDS WOULD SURELY PREVENT YOU FROM INCLOSING
CIPHER AND MESSAGE IN THE SAME ENVELOPE SHOULD IT MISCARRY YOU ARE
UNDONE AS IT IS BOTH HAVE TO GO WRONG BEFORE ANY HARM COMES FROM
IT OUR SECOND POST IS NOW OVERDUE AND I SHALL BE SURPRISED IF IT
DOES NOT BRING US EITHER A FURTHER LETTER OF EXPLANATION OR AS IS
MORE PROBABLE THE VERY VOLUME TO WHICH THESE FIGURES REFER
HOLMESS CALCULATION WAS FULFILLED WITHIN A VERY FEW MINUTES BY THE
APPEARANCE OF BILLY THE PAGE WITH THE VERY LETTER WHICH WE WERE
EXPECTING
THE SAME WRITING REMARKED HOLMES AS HE OPENED THE ENVELOPE AND
ACTUALLY SIGNED HE ADDED IN AN EXULTANT VOICE AS HE UNFOLDED THE
EPISTLE COME WE ARE GETTING ON WATSON HIS BROW CLOUDED
HOWEVER AS HE GLANCED OVER THE CONTENTS
DEAR ME THIS IS VERY DISAPPOINTING I FEAR WATSON THAT ALL OUR
EXPECTATIONS COME TO NOTHING I TRUST THAT THE MAN PORLOCK WILL COME
TO NO HARM
DEAR MR HOLMES HE SAYS
I WILL GO NO FURTHER IN THIS MATTER IT IS TOO DANGEROUSHE
SUSPECTS ME I CAN SEE THAT HE SUSPECTS ME HE CAME TO ME QUITE
UNEXPECTEDLY AFTER I HAD ACTUALLY ADDRESSED THIS ENVELOPE WITH THE
INTENTION OF SENDING YOU THE KEY TO THE CIPHER I WAS ABLE TO COVER
IT UP IF HE HAD SEEN IT IT WOULD HAVE GONE HARD WITH ME BUT I READ
SUSPICION IN HIS EYES PLEASE BURN THE CIPHER MESSAGE WHICH CAN NOW
BE OF NO USE TO YOU
FRED PORLOCK
HOLMES SAT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME TWISTING THIS LETTER BETWEEN HIS
FINGERS AND FROWNING AS HE STARED INTO THE FIRE
AFTER ALL HE SAID AT LAST THERE MAY BE NOTHING IN IT IT MAY BE
ONLY HIS GUILTY CONSCIENCE KNOWING HIMSELF TO BE A TRAITOR HE MAY
HAVE READ THE ACCUSATION IN THE OTHERS EYES
THE OTHER BEING I PRESUME PROFESSOR MORIARTY
NO LESS WHEN ANY OF THAT PARTY TALK ABOUT HE YOU KNOW WHOM THEY
MEAN THERE IS ONE PREDOMINANT HE FOR ALL OF THEM
BUT WHAT CAN HE DO
HUM THATS A LARGE QUESTION WHEN YOU HAVE ONE OF THE FIRST BRAINS
OF EUROPE UP AGAINST YOU AND ALL THE POWERS OF DARKNESS AT HIS BACK
THERE ARE INFINITE POSSIBILITIES ANYHOW FRIEND PORLOCK IS EVIDENTLY
SCARED OUT OF HIS SENSESKINDLY COMPARE THE WRITING IN THE NOTE TO
THAT UPON ITS ENVELOPE WHICH WAS DONE HE TELLS US BEFORE THIS
ILLOMENED VISIT THE ONE IS CLEAR AND FIRM THE OTHER HARDLY
LEGIBLE
WHY DID HE WRITE AT ALL WHY DID HE NOT SIMPLY DROP IT
BECAUSE HE FEARED I WOULD MAKE SOME INQUIRY AFTER HIM IN THAT CASE
AND POSSIBLY BRING TROUBLE ON HIM
NO DOUBT SAID I OF COURSE I HAD PICKED UP THE ORIGINAL CIPHER
MESSAGE AND WAS BENDING MY BROWS OVER IT ITS PRETTY MADDENING TO
THINK THAT AN IMPORTANT SECRET MAY LIE HERE ON THIS SLIP OF PAPER
AND THAT IT IS BEYOND HUMAN POWER TO PENETRATE IT
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD PUSHED AWAY HIS UNTASTED BREAKFAST AND LIT THE
UNSAVOURY PIPE WHICH WAS THE COMPANION OF HIS DEEPEST MEDITATIONS I
WONDER SAID HE LEANING BACK AND STARING AT THE CEILING PERHAPS
THERE ARE POINTS WHICH HAVE ESCAPED YOUR MACHIAVELLIAN INTELLECT LET
US CONSIDER THE PROBLEM IN THE LIGHT OF PURE REASON THIS MANS
REFERENCE IS TO A BOOK THAT IS OUR POINT OF DEPARTURE
A SOMEWHAT VAGUE ONE
LET US SEE THEN IF WE CAN NARROW IT DOWN AS I FOCUS MY MIND UPON
IT IT SEEMS RATHER LESS IMPENETRABLE WHAT INDICATIONS HAVE WE AS TO
THIS BOOK
NONE
WELL WELL IT IS SURELY NOT QUITE SO BAD AS THAT THE CIPHER
MESSAGE BEGINS WITH A LARGE DOES IT NOT WE MAY TAKE IT AS A
WORKING HYPOTHESIS THAT IS THE PARTICULAR PAGE TO WHICH THE
CIPHER REFERS SO OUR BOOK HAS ALREADY BECOME A LARGE BOOK WHICH IS
SURELY SOMETHING GAINED WHAT OTHER INDICATIONS HAVE WE AS TO THE
NATURE OF THIS LARGE BOOK THE NEXT SIGN IS C WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
THAT WATSON
CHAPTER THE SECOND NO DOUBT
HARDLY THAT WATSON YOU WILL I AM SURE AGREE WITH ME THAT IF THE
PAGE BE GIVEN THE NUMBER OF THE CHAPTER IS IMMATERIAL ALSO THAT IF
PAGE FINDS US ONLY IN THE SECOND CHAPTER THE LENGTH OF THE FIRST
ONE MUST HAVE BEEN REALLY INTOLERABLE
COLUMN I CRIED
BRILLIANT WATSON YOU ARE SCINTILLATING THIS MORNING IF IT IS NOT
COLUMN THEN I AM VERY MUCH DECEIVED SO NOW YOU SEE WE BEGIN TO
VISUALIZE A LARGE BOOK PRINTED IN DOUBLE COLUMNS WHICH ARE EACH OF A
CONSIDERABLE LENGTH SINCE ONE OF THE WORDS IS NUMBERED IN THE
DOCUMENT AS THE TWO HUNDRED AND NINETYTHIRD HAVE WE REACHED THE
LIMITS OF WHAT REASON CAN SUPPLY
I FEAR THAT WE HAVE
SURELY YOU DO YOURSELF AN INJUSTICE ONE MORE CORUSCATION MY DEAR
WATSONYET ANOTHER BRAINWAVE HAD THE VOLUME BEEN AN UNUSUAL ONE
HE WOULD HAVE SENT IT TO ME INSTEAD OF THAT HE HAD INTENDED BEFORE
HIS PLANS WERE NIPPED TO SEND ME THE CLUE IN THIS ENVELOPE HE SAYS
SO IN HIS NOTE THIS WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THE BOOK IS ONE
WHICH HE THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING FOR MYSELF HE
HAD ITAND HE IMAGINED THAT I WOULD HAVE IT TOO IN SHORT WATSON
IT IS A VERY COMMON BOOK
WHAT YOU SAY CERTAINLY SOUNDS PLAUSIBLE
SO WE HAVE CONTRACTED OUR FIELD OF SEARCH TO A LARGE BOOK PRINTED
IN DOUBLE COLUMNS AND IN COMMON USE
THE BIBLE I CRIED TRIUMPHANTLY
GOOD WATSON GOOD BUT NOT IF I MAY SAY SO QUITE GOOD ENOUGH
EVEN IF I ACCEPTED THE COMPLIMENT FOR MYSELF I COULD HARDLY NAME ANY
VOLUME WHICH WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO LIE AT THE ELBOW OF ONE OF
MORIARTYS ASSOCIATES BESIDES THE EDITIONS OF HOLY WRIT ARE SO
NUMEROUS THAT HE COULD HARDLY SUPPOSE THAT TWO COPIES WOULD HAVE THE
SAME PAGINATION THIS IS CLEARLY A BOOK WHICH IS STANDARDIZED HE
KNOWS FOR CERTAIN THAT HIS PAGE WILL EXACTLY AGREE WITH MY PAGE
BUT VERY FEW BOOKS WOULD CORRESPOND WITH THAT
EXACTLY THEREIN LIES OUR SALVATION OUR SEARCH IS NARROWED DOWN TO
STANDARDIZED BOOKS WHICH ANYONE MAY BE SUPPOSED TO POSSESS
BRADSHAW
THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES WATSON THE VOCABULARY OF BRADSHAW IS
NERVOUS AND TERSE BUT LIMITED THE SELECTION OF WORDS WOULD HARDLY
LEND ITSELF TO THE SENDING OF GENERAL MESSAGES WE WILL ELIMINATE
BRADSHAW THE DICTIONARY IS I FEAR INADMISSIBLE FOR THE SAME
REASON WHAT THEN IS LEFT
AN ALMANAC
EXCELLENT WATSON I AM VERY MUCH MISTAKEN IF YOU HAVE NOT TOUCHED
THE SPOT AN ALMANAC LET US CONSIDER THE CLAIMS OF WHITAKERS
ALMANAC IT IS IN COMMON USE IT HAS THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF PAGES
IT IS IN DOUBLE COLUMN THOUGH RESERVED IN ITS EARLIER VOCABULARY IT
BECOMES IF I REMEMBER RIGHT QUITE GARRULOUS TOWARDS THE END HE
PICKED THE VOLUME FROM HIS DESK HERE IS PAGE COLUMN TWO A
SUBSTANTIAL BLOCK OF PRINT DEALING I PERCEIVE WITH THE TRADE AND
RESOURCES OF BRITISH INDIA JOT DOWN THE WORDS WATSON NUMBER
THIRTEEN IS MAHRATTA NOT I FEAR A VERY AUSPICIOUS BEGINNING
NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTYSEVEN IS GOVERNMENT WHICH AT LEAST
MAKES SENSE THOUGH SOMEWHAT IRRELEVANT TO OURSELVES AND PROFESSOR
MORIARTY NOW LET US TRY AGAIN WHAT DOES THE MAHRATTA GOVERNMENT DO
ALAS THE NEXT WORD IS PIGSBRISTLES WE ARE UNDONE MY GOOD
WATSON IT IS FINISHED
HE HAD SPOKEN IN JESTING VEIN BUT THE TWITCHING OF HIS BUSHY
EYEBROWS BESPOKE HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AND IRRITATION I SAT HELPLESS
AND UNHAPPY STARING INTO THE FIRE A LONG SILENCE WAS BROKEN BY A
SUDDEN EXCLAMATION FROM HOLMES WHO DASHED AT A CUPBOARD FROM WHICH
HE EMERGED WITH A SECOND YELLOWCOVERED VOLUME IN HIS HAND
WE PAY THE PRICE WATSON FOR BEING TOO UPTODATE HE CRIED WE
ARE BEFORE OUR TIME AND SUFFER THE USUAL PENALTIES BEING THE
SEVENTH OF JANUARY WE HAVE VERY PROPERLY LAID IN THE NEW ALMANAC IT
IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT PORLOCK TOOK HIS MESSAGE FROM THE OLD ONE
NO DOUBT HE WOULD HAVE TOLD US SO HAD HIS LETTER OF EXPLANATION BEEN
WRITTEN NOW LET US SEE WHAT PAGE HAS IN STORE FOR US NUMBER
THIRTEEN IS THERE WHICH IS MUCH MORE PROMISING NUMBER ONE HUNDRED
AND TWENTYSEVEN IS ISTHERE ISHOLMESS EYES WERE GLEAMING
WITH EXCITEMENT AND HIS THIN NERVOUS FINGERS TWITCHED AS HE COUNTED
THE WORDSDANGER HA HA CAPITAL PUT THAT DOWN WATSON THERE
IS DANGER MAY COME VERY SOON ONE THEN WE HAVE THE NAME
DOUGLAS RICH COUNTRY NOW AT BIRLSTONE HOUSE
BIRLSTONE CONFIDENCE IS PRESSING THERE WATSON WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF PURE REASON AND ITS FRUIT IF THE GREENGROCER HAD SUCH A
THING AS A LAUREL WREATH I SHOULD SEND BILLY ROUND FOR IT
I WAS STARING AT THE STRANGE MESSAGE WHICH I HAD SCRAWLED AS HE
DECIPHERED IT UPON A SHEET OF FOOLSCAP ON MY KNEE
WHAT A QUEER SCRAMBLING WAY OF EXPRESSING HIS MEANING SAID I
ON THE CONTRARY HE HAS DONE QUITE REMARKABLY WELL SAID HOLMES
WHEN YOU SEARCH A SINGLE COLUMN FOR WORDS WITH WHICH TO EXPRESS YOUR
MEANING YOU CAN HARDLY EXPECT TO GET EVERYTHING YOU WANT YOU ARE
BOUND TO LEAVE SOMETHING TO THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOUR CORRESPONDENT
THE PURPORT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR SOME DEVILTRY IS INTENDED AGAINST ONE
DOUGLAS WHOEVER HE MAY BE RESIDING AS STATED A RICH COUNTRY
GENTLEMAN HE IS SURECONFIDENCE WAS AS NEAR AS HE COULD GET TO
CONFIDENTTHAT IT IS PRESSING THERE IS OUR RESULTAND A VERY
WORKMANLIKE LITTLE BIT OF ANALYSIS IT WAS
HOLMES HAD THE IMPERSONAL JOY OF THE TRUE ARTIST IN HIS BETTER WORK
EVEN AS HE MOURNED DARKLY WHEN IT FELL BELOW THE HIGH LEVEL TO WHICH
HE ASPIRED HE WAS STILL CHUCKLING OVER HIS SUCCESS WHEN BILLY SWUNG
OPEN THE DOOR AND INSPECTOR MACDONALD OF SCOTLAND YARD WAS USHERED
INTO THE ROOM
THOSE WERE THE EARLY DAYS AT THE END OF THE S WHEN ALEC
MACDONALD WAS FAR FROM HAVING ATTAINED THE NATIONAL FAME WHICH HE HAS
NOW ACHIEVED HE WAS A YOUNG BUT TRUSTED MEMBER OF THE DETECTIVE
FORCE WHO HAD DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF IN SEVERAL CASES WHICH HAD BEEN
ENTRUSTED TO HIM HIS TALL BONY FIGURE GAVE PROMISE OF EXCEPTIONAL
PHYSICAL STRENGTH WHILE HIS GREAT CRANIUM AND DEEPSET LUSTROUS
EYES SPOKE NO LESS CLEARLY OF THE KEEN INTELLIGENCE WHICH TWINKLED
OUT FROM BEHIND HIS BUSHY EYEBROWS HE WAS A SILENT PRECISE MAN WITH
A DOUR NATURE AND A HARD ABERDONIAN ACCENT
TWICE ALREADY IN HIS CAREER HAD HOLMES HELPED HIM TO ATTAIN SUCCESS
HIS OWN SOLE REWARD BEING THE INTELLECTUAL JOY OF THE PROBLEM FOR
THIS REASON THE AFFECTION AND RESPECT OF THE SCOTCHMAN FOR HIS
AMATEUR COLLEAGUE WERE PROFOUND AND HE SHOWED THEM BY THE FRANKNESS
WITH WHICH HE CONSULTED HOLMES IN EVERY DIFFICULTY MEDIOCRITY KNOWS
NOTHING HIGHER THAN ITSELF BUT TALENT INSTANTLY RECOGNIZES GENIUS
AND MACDONALD HAD TALENT ENOUGH FOR HIS PROFESSION TO ENABLE HIM TO
PERCEIVE THAT THERE WAS NO HUMILIATION IN SEEKING THE ASSISTANCE OF
ONE WHO ALREADY STOOD ALONE IN EUROPE BOTH IN HIS GIFTS AND IN HIS
EXPERIENCE HOLMES WAS NOT PRONE TO FRIENDSHIP BUT HE WAS TOLERANT
OF THE BIG SCOTCHMAN AND SMILED AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
YOU ARE AN EARLY BIRD MR MAC SAID HE I WISH YOU LUCK WITH YOUR
WORM I FEAR THIS MEANS THAT THERE IS SOME MISCHIEF AFOOT
IF YOU SAID HOPE INSTEAD OF FEAR IT WOULD BE NEARER THE TRUTH
IM THINKING MR HOLMES THE INSPECTOR ANSWERED WITH A KNOWING
GRIN WELL MAYBE A WEE NIP WOULD KEEP OUT THE RAW MORNING CHILL
NO I WONT SMOKE I THANK YOU ILL HAVE TO BE PUSHING ON MY WAY
FOR THE EARLY HOURS OF A CASE ARE THE PRECIOUS ONES AS NO MAN KNOWS
BETTER THAN YOUR OWN SELF BUTBUT
THE INSPECTOR HAD STOPPED SUDDENLY AND WAS STARING WITH A LOOK OF
ABSOLUTE AMAZEMENT AT A PAPER UPON THE TABLE IT WAS THE SHEET UPON
WHICH I HAD SCRAWLED THE ENIGMATIC MESSAGE
DOUGLAS HE STAMMERED BIRLSTONE WHATS THIS MR HOLMES MAN
ITS WITCHCRAFT WHERE IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS WONDERFUL DID YOU
GET THOSE NAMES
IT IS A CIPHER THAT DR WATSON AND I HAVE HAD OCCASION TO SOLVE BUT
WHYWHATS AMISS WITH THE NAMES
THE INSPECTOR LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US IN DAZED
ASTONISHMENT JUST THIS SAID HE THAT MR DOUGLAS OF BIRLSTONE
MANOR HOUSE WAS HORRIBLY MURDERED LAST NIGHT
CHAPTER II
SHERLOCK HOLMES DISCOURSES
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE DRAMATIC MOMENTS FOR WHICH MY FRIEND EXISTED IT
WOULD BE AN OVERSTATEMENT TO SAY THAT HE WAS SHOCKED OR EVEN EXCITED
BY THE AMAZING ANNOUNCEMENT WITHOUT HAVING A TINGE OF CRUELTY IN HIS
SINGULAR COMPOSITION HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY CALLOUS FROM LONG
OVERSTIMULATION YET IF HIS EMOTIONS WERE DULLED HIS INTELLECTUAL
PERCEPTIONS WERE EXCEEDINGLY ACTIVE THERE WAS NO TRACE THEN OF THE
HORROR WHICH I HAD MYSELF FELT AT THIS CURT DECLARATION BUT HIS FACE
SHOWED RATHER THE QUIET AND INTERESTED COMPOSURE OF THE CHEMIST WHO
SEES THE CRYSTALS FALLING INTO POSITION FROM HIS OVERSATURATED
SOLUTION
REMARKABLE SAID HE REMARKABLE
YOU DONT SEEM SURPRISED
INTERESTED MR MAC BUT HARDLY SURPRISED WHY SHOULD I BE
SURPRISED I RECEIVE AN ANONYMOUS COMMUNICATION FROM A QUARTER WHICH
I KNOW TO BE IMPORTANT WARNING ME THAT DANGER THREATENS A CERTAIN
PERSON WITHIN AN HOUR I LEARN THAT THIS DANGER HAS ACTUALLY
MATERIALIZED AND THAT THE PERSON IS DEAD I AM INTERESTED BUT AS
YOU OBSERVE I AM NOT SURPRISED
IN A FEW SHORT SENTENCES HE EXPLAINED TO THE INSPECTOR THE FACTS
ABOUT THE LETTER AND THE CIPHER MACDONALD SAT WITH HIS CHIN ON HIS
HANDS AND HIS GREAT SANDY EYEBROWS BUNCHED INTO A YELLOW TANGLE
I WAS GOING DOWN TO BIRLSTONE THIS MORNING SAID HE I HAD COME TO
ASK YOU IF YOU CARED TO COME WITH MEYOU AND YOUR FRIEND HERE BUT
FROM WHAT YOU SAY WE MIGHT PERHAPS BE DOING BETTER WORK IN LONDON
I RATHER THINK NOT SAID HOLMES
HANG IT ALL MR HOLMES CRIED THE INSPECTOR THE PAPERS WILL BE
FULL OF THE BIRLSTONE MYSTERY IN A DAY OR TWO BUT WHERES THE
MYSTERY IF THERE IS A MAN IN LONDON WHO PROPHESIED THE CRIME BEFORE
EVER IT OCCURRED WE HAVE ONLY TO LAY OUR HANDS ON THAT MAN AND THE
REST WILL FOLLOW
NO DOUBT MR MAC BUT HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO LAY YOUR HANDS ON THE
SOCALLED PORLOCK
MACDONALD TURNED OVER THE LETTER WHICH HOLMES HAD HANDED HIM POSTED
IN CAMBERWELLTHAT DOESNT HELP US MUCH NAME YOU SAY IS ASSUMED
NOT MUCH TO GO ON CERTAINLY DIDNT YOU SAY THAT YOU HAVE SENT HIM
MONEY
TWICE
AND HOW
IN NOTES TO CAMBERWELL POSTOFFICE
DID YOU EVER TROUBLE TO SEE WHO CALLED FOR THEM
NO
THE INSPECTOR LOOKED SURPRISED AND A LITTLE SHOCKED WHY NOT
BECAUSE I ALWAYS KEEP FAITH I HAD PROMISED WHEN HE FIRST WROTE THAT
I WOULD NOT TRY TO TRACE HIM
YOU THINK THERE IS SOMEONE BEHIND HIM
I KNOW THERE IS
THIS PROFESSOR THAT IVE HEARD YOU MENTION
EXACTLY
INSPECTOR MACDONALD SMILED AND HIS EYELID QUIVERED AS HE GLANCED
TOWARDS ME I WONT CONCEAL FROM YOU MR HOLMES THAT WE THINK IN
THE C I D THAT YOU HAVE A WEE BIT OF A BEE IN YOUR BONNET OVER
THIS PROFESSOR I MADE SOME INQUIRIES MYSELF ABOUT THE MATTER HE
SEEMS TO BE A VERY RESPECTABLE LEARNED AND TALENTED SORT OF MAN
IM GLAD YOUVE GOT SO FAR AS TO RECOGNIZE THE TALENT
MAN YOU CANT BUT RECOGNIZE IT AFTER I HEARD YOUR VIEW I MADE IT
MY BUSINESS TO SEE HIM I HAD A CHAT WITH HIM ON ECLIPSES HOW THE
TALK GOT THAT WAY I CANNA THINK BUT HE HAD OUT A REFLECTOR LANTERN
AND A GLOBE AND MADE IT ALL CLEAR IN A MINUTE HE LENT ME A BOOK
BUT I DONT MIND SAYING THAT IT WAS A BIT ABOVE MY HEAD THOUGH I HAD
A GOOD ABERDEEN UPBRINGING HED HAVE MADE A GRAND MEENISTER WITH HIS
THIN FACE AND GRAY HAIR AND SOLEMNLIKE WAY OF TALKING WHEN HE PUT
HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER AS WE WERE PARTING IT WAS LIKE A FATHERS
BLESSING BEFORE YOU GO OUT INTO THE COLD CRUEL WORLD
HOLMES CHUCKLED AND RUBBED HIS HANDS GREAT HE SAID GREAT TELL
ME FRIEND MACDONALD THIS PLEASING AND TOUCHING INTERVIEW WAS I
SUPPOSE IN THE PROFESSORS STUDY
THATS SO
A FINE ROOM IS IT NOT
VERY FINEVERY HANDSOME INDEED MR HOLMES
YOU SAT IN FRONT OF HIS WRITING DESK
JUST SO
SUN IN YOUR EYES AND HIS FACE IN THE SHADOW
WELL IT WAS EVENING BUT I MIND THAT THE LAMP WAS TURNED ON MY
FACE
IT WOULD BE DID YOU HAPPEN TO OBSERVE A PICTURE OVER THE
PROFESSORS HEAD
I DONT MISS MUCH MR HOLMES MAYBE I LEARNED THAT FROM YOU YES I
SAW THE PICTUREA YOUNG WOMAN WITH HER HEAD ON HER HANDS PEEPING AT
YOU SIDEWAYS
THAT PAINTING WAS BY JEAN BAPTISTE GREUZE
THE INSPECTOR ENDEAVOURED TO LOOK INTERESTED
JEAN BAPTISTE GREUZE HOLMES CONTINUED JOINING HIS FINGER TIPS AND
LEANING WELL BACK IN HIS CHAIR WAS A FRENCH ARTIST WHO FLOURISHED
BETWEEN THE YEARS AND I ALLUDE OF COURSE TO HIS WORKING
CAREER MODERN CRITICISM HAS MORE THAN INDORSED THE HIGH OPINION
FORMED OF HIM BY HIS CONTEMPORARIES
THE INSPECTORS EYES GREW ABSTRACTED HADNT WE BETTER HE SAID
WE ARE DOING SO HOLMES INTERRUPTED ALL THAT I AM SAYING HAS A
VERY DIRECT AND VITAL BEARING UPON WHAT YOU HAVE CALLED THE BIRLSTONE
MYSTERY IN FACT IT MAY IN A SENSE BE CALLED THE VERY CENTRE OF IT
MACDONALD SMILED FEEBLY AND LOOKED APPEALINGLY TO ME YOUR THOUGHTS
MOVE A BIT TOO QUICK FOR ME MR HOLMES YOU LEAVE OUT A LINK OR TWO
AND I CANT GET OVER THE GAP WHAT IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD CAN BE THE
CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS DEAD PAINTING MAN AND THE AFFAIR AT
BIRLSTONE
ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE REMARKED HOLMES EVEN
THE TRIVIAL FACT THAT IN THE YEAR A PICTURE BY GREUZE ENTITLED
LA JEUNE FILLE A LAGNEAU FETCHED ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND
FRANCSMORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND POUNDSAT THE PORTALIS SALE MAY
START A TRAIN OF REFLECTION IN YOUR MIND
IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT DID THE INSPECTOR LOOKED HONESTLY INTERESTED
I MAY REMIND YOU HOLMES CONTINUED THAT THE PROFESSORS SALARY
CAN BE ASCERTAINED IN SEVERAL TRUSTWORTHY BOOKS OF REFERENCE IT IS
SEVEN HUNDRED A YEAR
THEN HOW COULD HE BUY
QUITE SO HOW COULD HE
AY THATS REMARKABLE SAID THE INSPECTOR THOUGHTFULLY TALK AWAY
MR HOLMES IM JUST LOVING IT ITS FINE
HOLMES SMILED HE WAS ALWAYS WARMED BY GENUINE ADMIRATIONTHE
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE REAL ARTIST WHAT ABOUT BIRLSTONE HE ASKED
WEVE TIME YET SAID THE INSPECTOR GLANCING AT HIS WATCH IVE A
CAB AT THE DOOR AND IT WONT TAKE US TWENTY MINUTES TO VICTORIA BUT
ABOUT THIS PICTURE I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME ONCE MR HOLMES THAT YOU
HAD NEVER MET PROFESSOR MORIARTY
NO I NEVER HAVE
THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HIS ROOMS
AH THATS ANOTHER MATTER I HAVE BEEN THREE TIMES IN HIS ROOMS
TWICE WAITING FOR HIM UNDER DIFFERENT PRETEXTS AND LEAVING BEFORE HE
CAME ONCEWELL I CAN HARDLY TELL ABOUT THE ONCE TO AN OFFICIAL
DETECTIVE IT WAS ON THE LAST OCCASION THAT I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF
RUNNING OVER HIS PAPERSWITH THE MOST UNEXPECTED RESULTS
YOU FOUND SOMETHING COMPROMISING
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT WAS WHAT AMAZED ME HOWEVER YOU HAVE NOW
SEEN THE POINT OF THE PICTURE IT SHOWS HIM TO BE A VERY WEALTHY MAN
HOW DID HE ACQUIRE WEALTH HE IS UNMARRIED HIS YOUNGER BROTHER IS A
STATION MASTER IN THE WEST OF ENGLAND HIS CHAIR IS WORTH SEVEN
HUNDRED A YEAR AND HE OWNS A GREUZE
WELL
SURELY THE INFERENCE IS PLAIN
YOU MEAN THAT HE HAS A GREAT INCOME AND THAT HE MUST EARN IT IN AN
ILLEGAL FASHION
EXACTLY OF COURSE I HAVE OTHER REASONS FOR THINKING SODOZENS OF
EXIGUOUS THREADS WHICH LEAD VAGUELY UP TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE WEB
WHERE THE POISONOUS MOTIONLESS CREATURE IS LURKING I ONLY MENTION
THE GREUZE BECAUSE IT BRINGS THE MATTER WITHIN THE RANGE OF YOUR OWN
OBSERVATION
WELL MR HOLMES I ADMIT THAT WHAT YOU SAY IS INTERESTING ITS
MORE THAN INTERESTINGITS JUST WONDERFUL BUT LET US HAVE IT A
LITTLE CLEARER IF YOU CAN IS IT FORGERY COINING BURGLARYWHERE
DOES THE MONEY COME FROM
HAVE YOU EVER READ OF JONATHAN WILD
WELL THE NAME HAS A FAMILIAR SOUND SOMEONE IN A NOVEL WAS HE NOT
I DONT TAKE MUCH STOCK OF DETECTIVES IN NOVELSCHAPS THAT DO THINGS
AND NEVER LET YOU SEE HOW THEY DO THEM THATS JUST INSPIRATION NOT
BUSINESS
JONATHAN WILD WASNT A DETECTIVE AND HE WASNT IN A NOVEL HE WAS A
MASTER CRIMINAL AND HE LIVED LAST CENTURY OR THEREABOUTS
THEN HES NO USE TO ME IM A PRACTICAL MAN
MR MAC THE MOST PRACTICAL THING THAT YOU EVER DID IN YOUR LIFE
WOULD BE TO SHUT YOURSELF UP FOR THREE MONTHS AND READ TWELVE HOURS A
DAY AT THE ANNALS OF CRIME EVERYTHING COMES IN CIRCLESEVEN
PROFESSOR MORIARTY JONATHAN WILD WAS THE HIDDEN FORCE OF THE LONDON
CRIMINALS TO WHOM HE SOLD HIS BRAINS AND HIS ORGANIZATION ON A
FIFTEEN PER CENT COMMISSION THE OLD WHEEL TURNS AND THE SAME SPOKE
COMES UP ITS ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE AND WILL BE AGAIN ILL TELL YOU
ONE OR TWO THINGS ABOUT MORIARTY WHICH MAY INTEREST YOU
YOULL INTEREST ME RIGHT ENOUGH
I HAPPEN TO KNOW WHO IS THE FIRST LINK IN HIS CHAINA CHAIN WITH
THIS NAPOLEONGONEWRONG AT ONE END AND A HUNDRED BROKEN FIGHTING
MEN PICKPOCKETS BLACKMAILERS AND CARD SHARPERS AT THE OTHER WITH
EVERY SORT OF CRIME IN BETWEEN HIS CHIEF OF STAFF IS COLONEL
SEBASTIAN MORAN AS ALOOF AND GUARDED AND INACCESSIBLE TO THE LAW AS
HIMSELF WHAT DO YOU THINK HE PAYS HIM
ID LIKE TO HEAR
SIX THOUSAND A YEAR THATS PAYING FOR BRAINS YOU SEETHE AMERICAN
BUSINESS PRINCIPLE I LEARNED THAT DETAIL QUITE BY CHANCE ITS MORE
THAN THE PRIME MINISTER GETS THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF MORIARTYS
GAINS AND OF THE SCALE ON WHICH HE WORKS ANOTHER POINT I MADE IT MY
BUSINESS TO HUNT DOWN SOME OF MORIARTYS CHECKS LATELYJUST COMMON
INNOCENT CHECKS THAT HE PAYS HIS HOUSEHOLD BILLS WITH THEY WERE
DRAWN ON SIX DIFFERENT BANKS DOES THAT MAKE ANY IMPRESSION ON YOUR
MIND
QUEER CERTAINLY BUT WHAT DO YOU GATHER FROM IT
THAT HE WANTED NO GOSSIP ABOUT HIS WEALTH NO SINGLE MAN SHOULD KNOW
WHAT HE HAD I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE HAS TWENTY BANKING ACCOUNTS THE
BULK OF HIS FORTUNE ABROAD IN THE DEUTSCHE BANK OR THE CREDIT
LYONNAIS AS LIKELY AS NOT SOMETIME WHEN YOU HAVE A YEAR OR TWO TO
SPARE I COMMEND TO YOU THE STUDY OF PROFESSOR MORIARTY
INSPECTOR MACDONALD HAD GROWN STEADILY MORE IMPRESSED AS THE
CONVERSATION PROCEEDED HE HAD LOST HIMSELF IN HIS INTEREST NOW HIS
PRACTICAL SCOTCH INTELLIGENCE BROUGHT HIM BACK WITH A SNAP TO THE
MATTER IN HAND
HE CAN KEEP ANYHOW SAID HE YOUVE GOT US SIDETRACKED WITH YOUR
INTERESTING ANECDOTES MR HOLMES WHAT REALLY COUNTS IS YOUR REMARK
THAT THERE IS SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PROFESSOR AND THE CRIME
THAT YOU GET FROM THE WARNING RECEIVED THROUGH THE MAN PORLOCK CAN
WE FOR OUR PRESENT PRACTICAL NEEDS GET ANY FURTHER THAN THAT
WE MAY FORM SOME CONCEPTION AS TO THE MOTIVES OF THE CRIME IT IS
AS I GATHER FROM YOUR ORIGINAL REMARKS AN INEXPLICABLE OR AT LEAST
AN UNEXPLAINED MURDER NOW PRESUMING THAT THE SOURCE OF THE CRIME
IS AS WE SUSPECT IT TO BE THERE MIGHT BE TWO DIFFERENT MOTIVES IN
THE FIRST PLACE I MAY TELL YOU THAT MORIARTY RULES WITH A ROD OF
IRON OVER HIS PEOPLE HIS DISCIPLINE IS TREMENDOUS THERE IS ONLY ONE
PUNISHMENT IN HIS CODE IT IS DEATH NOW WE MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT THIS
MURDERED MANTHIS DOUGLAS WHOSE APPROACHING FATE WAS KNOWN BY ONE OF
THE ARCHCRIMINALS SUBORDINATESHAD IN SOME WAY BETRAYED THE CHIEF
HIS PUNISHMENT FOLLOWED AND WOULD BE KNOWN TO ALLIF ONLY TO PUT
THE FEAR OF DEATH INTO THEM
WELL THAT IS ONE SUGGESTION MR HOLMES
THE OTHER IS THAT IT HAS BEEN ENGINEERED BY MORIARTY IN THE ORDINARY
COURSE OF BUSINESS WAS THERE ANY ROBBERY
I HAVE NOT HEARD
IF SO IT WOULD OF COURSE BE AGAINST THE FIRST HYPOTHESIS AND IN
FAVOUR OF THE SECOND MORIARTY MAY HAVE BEEN ENGAGED TO ENGINEER IT
ON A PROMISE OF PART SPOILS OR HE MAY HAVE BEEN PAID SO MUCH DOWN TO
MANAGE IT EITHER IS POSSIBLE BUT WHICHEVER IT MAY BE OR IF IT IS
SOME THIRD COMBINATION IT IS DOWN AT BIRLSTONE THAT WE MUST SEEK THE
SOLUTION I KNOW OUR MAN TOO WELL TO SUPPOSE THAT HE HAS LEFT
ANYTHING UP HERE WHICH MAY LEAD US TO HIM
THEN TO BIRLSTONE WE MUST GO CRIED MACDONALD JUMPING FROM HIS
CHAIR MY WORD ITS LATER THAN I THOUGHT I CAN GIVE YOU
GENTLEMEN FIVE MINUTES FOR PREPARATION AND THAT IS ALL
AND AMPLE FOR US BOTH SAID HOLMES AS HE SPRANG UP AND HASTENED TO
CHANGE FROM HIS DRESSING GOWN TO HIS COAT WHILE WE ARE ON OUR WAY
MR MAC I WILL ASK YOU TO BE GOOD ENOUGH TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT
ALL ABOUT IT PROVED TO BE DISAPPOINTINGLY LITTLE AND YET THERE WAS
ENOUGH TO ASSURE US THAT THE CASE BEFORE US MIGHT WELL BE WORTHY OF
THE EXPERTS CLOSEST ATTENTION HE BRIGHTENED AND RUBBED HIS THIN
HANDS TOGETHER AS HE LISTENED TO THE MEAGRE BUT REMARKABLE DETAILS A
LONG SERIES OF STERILE WEEKS LAY BEHIND US AND HERE AT LAST THERE
WAS A FITTING OBJECT FOR THOSE REMARKABLE POWERS WHICH LIKE ALL
SPECIAL GIFTS BECOME IRKSOME TO THEIR OWNER WHEN THEY ARE NOT IN
USE THAT RAZOR BRAIN BLUNTED AND RUSTED WITH INACTION
SHERLOCK HOLMESS EYES GLISTENED HIS PALE CHEEKS TOOK A WARMER HUE
AND HIS WHOLE EAGER FACE SHONE WITH AN INWARD LIGHT WHEN THE CALL FOR
WORK REACHED HIM LEANING FORWARD IN THE CAB HE LISTENED INTENTLY TO
MACDONALDS SHORT SKETCH OF THE PROBLEM WHICH AWAITED US IN SUSSEX
THE INSPECTOR WAS HIMSELF DEPENDENT AS HE EXPLAINED TO US UPON A
SCRIBBLED ACCOUNT FORWARDED TO HIM BY THE MILK TRAIN IN THE EARLY
HOURS OF THE MORNING WHITE MASON THE LOCAL OFFICER WAS A PERSONAL
FRIEND AND HENCE MACDONALD HAD BEEN NOTIFIED MUCH MORE PROMPTLY THAN
IS USUAL AT SCOTLAND YARD WHEN PROVINCIALS NEED THEIR ASSISTANCE IT
IS A VERY COLD SCENT UPON WHICH THE METROPOLITAN EXPERT IS GENERALLY
ASKED TO RUN
DEAR INSPECTOR MACDONALD SAID THE LETTER WHICH HE READ TO US
OFFICIAL REQUISITION FOR YOUR SERVICES IS IN SEPARATE ENVELOPE THIS
IS FOR YOUR PRIVATE EYE WIRE ME WHAT TRAIN IN THE MORNING YOU CAN
GET FOR BIRLSTONE AND I WILL MEET ITOR HAVE IT MET IF I AM TOO
OCCUPIED THIS CASE IS A SNORTER DONT WASTE A MOMENT IN GETTING
STARTED IF YOU CAN BRING MR HOLMES PLEASE DO SO FOR HE WILL FIND
SOMETHING AFTER HIS OWN HEART WE WOULD THINK THE WHOLE THING HAD
BEEN FIXED UP FOR THEATRICAL EFFECT IF THERE WASNT A DEAD MAN IN THE
MIDDLE OF IT MY WORD IT IS A SNORTER
YOUR FRIEND SEEMS TO BE NO FOOL REMARKED HOLMES
NO SIR WHITE MASON IS A VERY LIVE MAN IF I AM ANY JUDGE
WELL HAVE YOU ANYTHING MORE
ONLY THAT HE WILL GIVE US EVERY DETAIL WHEN WE MEET
THEN HOW DID YOU GET AT MR DOUGLAS AND THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN
HORRIBLY MURDERED
THAT WAS IN THE ENCLOSED OFFICIAL REPORT IT DIDNT SAY HORRIBLE
THATS NOT A RECOGNIZED OFFICIAL TERM IT GAVE THE NAME JOHN DOUGLAS
IT MENTIONED THAT HIS INJURIES HAD BEEN IN THE HEAD FROM THE
DISCHARGE OF A SHOTGUN IT ALSO MENTIONED THE HOUR OF THE ALARM
WHICH WAS CLOSE ON TO MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT IT ADDED THAT THE CASE WAS
UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF MURDER BUT THAT NO ARREST HAD BEEN MADE AND THAT
THE CASE WAS ONE WHICH PRESENTED SOME VERY PERPLEXING AND
EXTRAORDINARY FEATURES THATS ABSOLUTELY ALL WE HAVE AT PRESENT MR
HOLMES
THEN WITH YOUR PERMISSION WE WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT MR MAC THE
TEMPTATION TO FORM PREMATURE THEORIES UPON INSUFFICIENT DATA IS THE
BANE OF OUR PROFESSION I CAN SEE ONLY TWO THINGS FOR CERTAIN AT
PRESENTA GREAT BRAIN IN LONDON AND A DEAD MAN IN SUSSEX ITS THE
CHAIN BETWEEN THAT WE ARE GOING TO TRACE
CHAPTER III
THE TRAGEDY OF BIRLSTONE
NOW FOR A MOMENT I WILL ASK LEAVE TO REMOVE MY OWN INSIGNIFICANT
PERSONALITY AND TO DESCRIBE EVENTS WHICH OCCURRED BEFORE WE ARRIVED
UPON THE SCENE BY THE LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH CAME TO US AFTERWARDS
ONLY IN THIS WAY CAN I MAKE THE READER APPRECIATE THE PEOPLE
CONCERNED AND THE STRANGE SETTING IN WHICH THEIR FATE WAS CAST
THE VILLAGE OF BIRLSTONE IS A SMALL AND VERY ANCIENT CLUSTER OF
HALFTIMBERED COTTAGES ON THE NORTHERN BORDER OF THE COUNTY OF
SUSSEX FOR CENTURIES IT HAD REMAINED UNCHANGED BUT WITHIN THE LAST
FEW YEARS ITS PICTURESQUE APPEARANCE AND SITUATION HAVE ATTRACTED A
NUMBER OF WELLTODO RESIDENTS WHOSE VILLAS PEEP OUT FROM THE WOODS
AROUND THESE WOODS ARE LOCALLY SUPPOSED TO BE THE EXTREME FRINGE OF
THE GREAT WEALD FOREST WHICH THINS AWAY UNTIL IT REACHES THE
NORTHERN CHALK DOWNS A NUMBER OF SMALL SHOPS HAVE COME INTO BEING TO
MEET THE WANTS OF THE INCREASED POPULATION SO THERE SEEMS SOME
PROSPECT THAT BIRLSTONE MAY SOON GROW FROM AN ANCIENT VILLAGE INTO A
MODERN TOWN IT IS THE CENTRE FOR A CONSIDERABLE AREA OF COUNTRY
SINCE TUNBRIDGE WELLS THE NEAREST PLACE OF IMPORTANCE IS TEN OR
TWELVE MILES TO THE EASTWARD OVER THE BORDERS OF KENT
ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE TOWN STANDING IN AN OLD PARK FAMOUS FOR
ITS HUGE BEECH TREES IS THE ANCIENT MANOR HOUSE OF BIRLSTONE PART
OF THIS VENERABLE BUILDING DATES BACK TO THE TIME OF THE FIRST
CRUSADE WHEN HUGO DE CAPUS BUILT A FORTALICE IN THE CENTRE OF THE
ESTATE WHICH HAD BEEN GRANTED TO HIM BY THE RED KING THIS WAS
DESTROYED BY FIRE IN AND SOME OF ITS SMOKEBLACKENED CORNER
STONES WERE USED WHEN IN JACOBEAN TIMES A BRICK COUNTRY HOUSE ROSE
UPON THE RUINS OF THE FEUDAL CASTLE
THE MANOR HOUSE WITH ITS MANY GABLES AND ITS SMALL DIAMONDPANED
WINDOWS WAS STILL MUCH AS THE BUILDER HAD LEFT IT IN THE EARLY
SEVENTEENTH CENTURY OF THE DOUBLE MOATS WHICH HAD GUARDED ITS MORE
WARLIKE PREDECESSOR THE OUTER HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO DRY UP AND SERVED
THE HUMBLE FUNCTION OF A KITCHEN GARDEN THE INNER ONE WAS STILL
THERE AND LAY FORTY FEET IN BREADTH THOUGH NOW ONLY A FEW FEET IN
DEPTH ROUND THE WHOLE HOUSE A SMALL STREAM FED IT AND CONTINUED
BEYOND IT SO THAT THE SHEET OF WATER THOUGH TURBID WAS NEVER
DITCHLIKE OR UNHEALTHY THE GROUND FLOOR WINDOWS WERE WITHIN A FOOT
OF THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
THE ONLY APPROACH TO THE HOUSE WAS OVER A DRAWBRIDGE THE CHAINS AND
WINDLASS OF WHICH HAD LONG BEEN RUSTED AND BROKEN THE LATEST TENANTS
OF THE MANOR HOUSE HAD HOWEVER WITH CHARACTERISTIC ENERGY SET THIS
RIGHT AND THE DRAWBRIDGE WAS NOT ONLY CAPABLE OF BEING RAISED BUT
ACTUALLY WAS RAISED EVERY EVENING AND LOWERED EVERY MORNING BY THUS
RENEWING THE CUSTOM OF THE OLD FEUDAL DAYS THE MANOR HOUSE WAS
CONVERTED INTO AN ISLAND DURING THE NIGHTA FACT WHICH HAD A VERY
DIRECT BEARING UPON THE MYSTERY WHICH WAS SOON TO ENGAGE THE
ATTENTION OF ALL ENGLAND
THE HOUSE HAD BEEN UNTENANTED FOR SOME YEARS AND WAS THREATENING TO
MOULDER INTO A PICTURESQUE DECAY WHEN THE DOUGLASES TOOK POSSESSION
OF IT THIS FAMILY CONSISTED OF ONLY TWO INDIVIDUALSJOHN DOUGLAS
AND HIS WIFE DOUGLAS WAS A REMARKABLE MAN BOTH IN CHARACTER AND IN
PERSON IN AGE HE MAY HAVE BEEN ABOUT FIFTY WITH A STRONGJAWED
RUGGED FACE A GRIZZLING MOUSTACHE PECULIARLY KEEN GRAY EYES AND A
WIRY VIGOROUS FIGURE WHICH HAD LOST NOTHING OF THE STRENGTH AND
ACTIVITY OF YOUTH HE WAS CHEERY AND GENIAL TO ALL BUT SOMEWHAT
OFFHAND IN HIS MANNERS GIVING THE IMPRESSION THAT HE HAD SEEN LIFE
IN SOCIAL STRATA ON SOME FAR LOWER HORIZON THAN THE COUNTY SOCIETY OF
SUSSEX
YET THOUGH LOOKED AT WITH SOME CURIOSITY AND RESERVE BY HIS MORE
CULTIVATED NEIGHBOURS HE SOON ACQUIRED A GREAT POPULARITY AMONG THE
VILLAGERS SUBSCRIBING HANDSOMELY TO ALL LOCAL OBJECTS AND ATTENDING
THEIR SMOKING CONCERTS AND OTHER FUNCTIONS WHERE HAVING A
REMARKABLY RICH TENOR VOICE HE WAS ALWAYS READY TO OBLIGE WITH AN
EXCELLENT SONG HE APPEARED TO HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY WHICH WAS SAID
TO HAVE BEEN GAINED IN THE CALIFORNIA GOLD FIELDS AND IT WAS CLEAR
FROM HIS OWN TALK AND THAT OF HIS WIFE THAT HE HAD SPENT A PART OF
HIS LIFE IN AMERICA
THE GOOD IMPRESSION WHICH HAD BEEN PRODUCED BY HIS GENEROSITY AND BY
HIS DEMOCRATIC MANNERS WAS INCREASED BY A REPUTATION GAINED FOR UTTER
INDIFFERENCE TO DANGER THOUGH A WRETCHED RIDER HE TURNED OUT AT
EVERY MEET AND TOOK THE MOST AMAZING FALLS IN HIS DETERMINATION TO
HOLD HIS OWN WITH THE BEST WHEN THE VICARAGE CAUGHT FIRE HE
DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF ALSO BY THE FEARLESSNESS WITH WHICH HE
REENTERED THE BUILDING TO SAVE PROPERTY AFTER THE LOCAL FIRE BRIGADE
HAD GIVEN IT UP AS IMPOSSIBLE THUS IT CAME ABOUT THAT JOHN DOUGLAS
OF THE MANOR HOUSE HAD WITHIN FIVE YEARS WON HIMSELF QUITE A
REPUTATION IN BIRLSTONE
HIS WIFE TOO WAS POPULAR WITH THOSE WHO HAD MADE HER ACQUAINTANCE
THOUGH AFTER THE ENGLISH FASHION THE CALLERS UPON A STRANGER WHO
SETTLED IN THE COUNTY WITHOUT INTRODUCTIONS WERE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
THIS MATTERED THE LESS TO HER AS SHE WAS RETIRING BY DISPOSITION
AND VERY MUCH ABSORBED TO ALL APPEARANCE IN HER HUSBAND AND HER
DOMESTIC DUTIES IT WAS KNOWN THAT SHE WAS AN ENGLISH LADY WHO HAD
MET MR DOUGLAS IN LONDON HE BEING AT THAT TIME A WIDOWER SHE WAS A
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN TALL DARK AND SLENDER SOME TWENTY YEARS YOUNGER
THAN HER HUSBAND A DISPARITY WHICH SEEMED IN NO WISE TO MAR THE
CONTENTMENT OF THEIR FAMILY LIFE
IT WAS REMARKED SOMETIMES HOWEVER BY THOSE WHO KNEW THEM BEST THAT
THE CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO DID NOT APPEAR TO BE COMPLETE SINCE
THE WIFE WAS EITHER VERY RETICENT ABOUT HER HUSBANDS PAST LIFE OR
ELSE AS SEEMED MORE LIKELY WAS IMPERFECTLY INFORMED ABOUT IT IT
HAD ALSO BEEN NOTED AND COMMENTED UPON BY A FEW OBSERVANT PEOPLE THAT
THERE WERE SIGNS SOMETIMES OF SOME NERVESTRAIN UPON THE PART OF MRS
DOUGLAS AND THAT SHE WOULD DISPLAY ACUTE UNEASINESS IF HER ABSENT
HUSBAND SHOULD EVER BE PARTICULARLY LATE IN HIS RETURN ON A QUIET
COUNTRYSIDE WHERE ALL GOSSIP IS WELCOME THIS WEAKNESS OF THE LADY
OF THE MANOR HOUSE DID NOT PASS WITHOUT REMARK AND IT BULKED LARGER
UPON PEOPLES MEMORY WHEN THE EVENTS AROSE WHICH GAVE IT A VERY
SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE
THERE WAS YET ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL WHOSE RESIDENCE UNDER THAT ROOF WAS
IT IS TRUE ONLY AN INTERMITTENT ONE BUT WHOSE PRESENCE AT THE TIME
OF THE STRANGE HAPPENINGS WHICH WILL NOW BE NARRATED BROUGHT HIS NAME
PROMINENTLY BEFORE THE PUBLIC THIS WAS CECIL JAMES BARKER OF HALES
LODGE HAMPSTEAD
CECIL BARKERS TALL LOOSEJOINTED FIGURE WAS A FAMILIAR ONE IN THE
MAIN STREET OF BIRLSTONE VILLAGE FOR HE WAS A FREQUENT AND WELCOME
VISITOR AT THE MANOR HOUSE HE WAS THE MORE NOTICED AS BEING THE ONLY
FRIEND OF THE PAST UNKNOWN LIFE OF MR DOUGLAS WHO WAS EVER SEEN IN
HIS NEW ENGLISH SURROUNDINGS BARKER WAS HIMSELF AN UNDOUBTED
ENGLISHMAN BUT BY HIS REMARKS IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE HAD FIRST KNOWN
DOUGLAS IN AMERICA AND HAD THERE LIVED ON INTIMATE TERMS WITH HIM HE
APPEARED TO BE A MAN OF CONSIDERABLE WEALTH AND WAS REPUTED TO BE A
BACHELOR
IN AGE HE WAS RATHER YOUNGER THAN DOUGLASFORTYFIVE AT THE MOSTA
TALL STRAIGHT BROADCHESTED FELLOW WITH A CLEANSHAVED
PRIZEFIGHTER FACE THICK STRONG BLACK EYEBROWS AND A PAIR OF
MASTERFUL BLACK EYES WHICH MIGHT EVEN WITHOUT THE AID OF HIS VERY
CAPABLE HANDS CLEAR A WAY FOR HIM THROUGH A HOSTILE CROWD HE
NEITHER RODE NOR SHOT BUT SPENT HIS DAYS IN WANDERING ROUND THE OLD
VILLAGE WITH HIS PIPE IN HIS MOUTH OR IN DRIVING WITH HIS HOST OR
IN HIS ABSENCE WITH HIS HOSTESS OVER THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE AN
EASYGOING FREEHANDED GENTLEMAN SAID AMES THE BUTLER BUT MY
WORD I HAD RATHER NOT BE THE MAN THAT CROSSED HIM HE WAS CORDIAL
AND INTIMATE WITH DOUGLAS AND HE WAS NO LESS FRIENDLY WITH HIS
WIFEA FRIENDSHIP WHICH MORE THAN ONCE SEEMED TO CAUSE SOME
IRRITATION TO THE HUSBAND SO THAT EVEN THE SERVANTS WERE ABLE TO
PERCEIVE HIS ANNOYANCE SUCH WAS THE THIRD PERSON WHO WAS ONE OF THE
FAMILY WHEN THE CATASTROPHE OCCURRED
AS TO THE OTHER DENIZENS OF THE OLD BUILDING IT WILL SUFFICE OUT OF
A LARGE HOUSEHOLD TO MENTION THE PRIM RESPECTABLE AND CAPABLE AMES
AND MRS ALLEN A BUXOM AND CHEERFUL PERSON WHO RELIEVED THE LADY OF
SOME OF HER HOUSEHOLD CARES THE OTHER SIX SERVANTS IN THE HOUSE BEAR
NO RELATION TO THE EVENTS OF THE NIGHT OF JANUARY TH
IT WAS AT ELEVEN FORTYFIVE THAT THE FIRST ALARM REACHED THE SMALL
LOCAL POLICE STATION IN CHARGE OF SERGEANT WILSON OF THE SUSSEX
CONSTABULARY CECIL BARKER MUCH EXCITED HAD RUSHED UP TO THE DOOR
AND PEALED FURIOUSLY UPON THE BELL A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY HAD OCCURRED
AT THE MANOR HOUSE AND JOHN DOUGLAS HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT WAS THE
BREATHLESS BURDEN OF HIS MESSAGE HE HAD HURRIED BACK TO THE HOUSE
FOLLOWED WITHIN A FEW MINUTES BY THE POLICE SERGEANT WHO ARRIVED AT
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME A LITTLE AFTER TWELVE OCLOCK AFTER TAKING
PROMPT STEPS TO WARN THE COUNTY AUTHORITIES THAT SOMETHING SERIOUS
WAS AFOOT
ON REACHING THE MANOR HOUSE THE SERGEANT HAD FOUND THE DRAWBRIDGE
DOWN THE WINDOWS LIGHTED UP AND THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD IN A STATE OF
WILD CONFUSION AND ALARM THE WHITEFACED SERVANTS WERE HUDDLING
TOGETHER IN THE HALL WITH THE FRIGHTENED BUTLER WRINGING HIS HANDS
IN THE DOORWAY ONLY CECIL BARKER SEEMED TO BE MASTER OF HIMSELF AND
HIS EMOTIONS HE HAD OPENED THE DOOR WHICH WAS NEAREST TO THE
ENTRANCE AND HE HAD BECKONED TO THE SERGEANT TO FOLLOW HIM AT THAT
MOMENT THERE ARRIVED DR WOOD A BRISK AND CAPABLE GENERAL
PRACTITIONER FROM THE VILLAGE THE THREE MEN ENTERED THE FATAL ROOM
TOGETHER WHILE THE HORRORSTRICKEN BUTLER FOLLOWED AT THEIR HEELS
CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM TO SHUT OUT THE TERRIBLE SCENE FROM THE
MAID SERVANTS
THE DEAD MAN LAY ON HIS BACK SPRAWLING WITH OUTSTRETCHED LIMBS IN
THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM HE WAS CLAD ONLY IN A PINK DRESSING GOWN
WHICH COVERED HIS NIGHT CLOTHES THERE WERE CARPET SLIPPERS ON HIS
BARE FEET THE DOCTOR KNELT BESIDE HIM AND HELD DOWN THE HAND LAMP
WHICH HAD STOOD ON THE TABLE ONE GLANCE AT THE VICTIM WAS ENOUGH TO
SHOW THE HEALER THAT HIS PRESENCE COULD BE DISPENSED WITH THE MAN
HAD BEEN HORRIBLY INJURED LYING ACROSS HIS CHEST WAS A CURIOUS
WEAPON A SHOTGUN WITH THE BARREL SAWED OFF A FOOT IN FRONT OF THE
TRIGGERS IT WAS CLEAR THAT THIS HAD BEEN FIRED AT CLOSE RANGE AND
THAT HE HAD RECEIVED THE WHOLE CHARGE IN THE FACE BLOWING HIS HEAD
ALMOST TO PIECES THE TRIGGERS HAD BEEN WIRED TOGETHER SO AS TO MAKE
THE SIMULTANEOUS DISCHARGE MORE DESTRUCTIVE
THE COUNTRY POLICEMAN WAS UNNERVED AND TROUBLED BY THE TREMENDOUS
RESPONSIBILITY WHICH HAD COME SO SUDDENLY UPON HIM WE WILL TOUCH
NOTHING UNTIL MY SUPERIORS ARRIVE HE SAID IN A HUSHED VOICE
STARING IN HORROR AT THE DREADFUL HEAD
NOTHING HAS BEEN TOUCHED UP TO NOW SAID CECIL BARKER ILL ANSWER
FOR THAT YOU SEE IT ALL EXACTLY AS I FOUND IT
WHEN WAS THAT THE SERGEANT HAD DRAWN OUT HIS NOTEBOOK
IT WAS JUST HALFPAST ELEVEN I HAD NOT BEGUN TO UNDRESS AND I WAS
SITTING BY THE FIRE IN MY BEDROOM WHEN I HEARD THE REPORT IT WAS NOT
VERY LOUDIT SEEMED TO BE MUFFLED I RUSHED DOWNI DONT SUPPOSE IT
WAS THIRTY SECONDS BEFORE I WAS IN THE ROOM
WAS THE DOOR OPEN
YES IT WAS OPEN POOR DOUGLAS WAS LYING AS YOU SEE HIM HIS BEDROOM
CANDLE WAS BURNING ON THE TABLE IT WAS I WHO LIT THE LAMP SOME
MINUTES AFTERWARD
DID YOU SEE NO ONE
NO I HEARD MRS DOUGLAS COMING DOWN THE STAIR BEHIND ME AND I
RUSHED OUT TO PREVENT HER FROM SEEING THIS DREADFUL SIGHT MRS
ALLEN THE HOUSEKEEPER CAME AND TOOK HER AWAY AMES HAD ARRIVED AND
WE RAN BACK INTO THE ROOM ONCE MORE
BUT SURELY I HAVE HEARD THAT THE DRAWBRIDGE IS KEPT UP ALL NIGHT
YES IT WAS UP UNTIL I LOWERED IT
THEN HOW COULD ANY MURDERER HAVE GOT AWAY IT IS OUT OF THE
QUESTION MR DOUGLAS MUST HAVE SHOT HIMSELF
THAT WAS OUR FIRST IDEA BUT SEE BARKER DREW ASIDE THE CURTAIN
AND SHOWED THAT THE LONG DIAMONDPANED WINDOW WAS OPEN TO ITS FULL
EXTENT AND LOOK AT THIS HE HELD THE LAMP DOWN AND ILLUMINATED A
SMUDGE OF BLOOD LIKE THE MARK OF A BOOTSOLE UPON THE WOODEN SILL
SOMEONE HAS STOOD THERE IN GETTING OUT
YOU MEAN THAT SOMEONE WADED ACROSS THE MOAT
EXACTLY
THEN IF YOU WERE IN THE ROOM WITHIN HALF A MINUTE OF THE CRIME HE
MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE WATER AT THAT VERY MOMENT
I HAVE NOT A DOUBT OF IT I WISH TO HEAVEN THAT I HAD RUSHED TO THE
WINDOW BUT THE CURTAIN SCREENED IT AS YOU CAN SEE AND SO IT NEVER
OCCURRED TO ME THEN I HEARD THE STEP OF MRS DOUGLAS AND I COULD
NOT LET HER ENTER THE ROOM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO HORRIBLE
HORRIBLE ENOUGH SAID THE DOCTOR LOOKING AT THE SHATTERED HEAD AND
THE TERRIBLE MARKS WHICH SURROUNDED IT IVE NEVER SEEN SUCH
INJURIES SINCE THE BIRLSTONE RAILWAY SMASH
BUT I SAY REMARKED THE POLICE SERGEANT WHOSE SLOW BUCOLIC
COMMON SENSE WAS STILL PONDERING THE OPEN WINDOW ITS ALL VERY WELL
YOUR SAYING THAT A MAN ESCAPED BY WADING THIS MOAT BUT WHAT I ASK
YOU IS HOW DID HE EVER GET INTO THE HOUSE AT ALL IF THE BRIDGE WAS
UP
AH THATS THE QUESTION SAID BARKER
AT WHAT OCLOCK WAS IT RAISED
IT WAS NEARLY SIX OCLOCK SAID AMES THE BUTLER
IVE HEARD SAID THE SERGEANT THAT IT WAS USUALLY RAISED AT
SUNSET THAT WOULD BE NEARER HALFPAST FOUR THAN SIX AT THIS TIME OF
YEAR
MRS DOUGLAS HAD VISITORS TO TEA SAID AMES I COULDNT RAISE IT
UNTIL THEY WENT THEN I WOUND IT UP MYSELF
THEN IT COMES TO THIS SAID THE SERGEANT IF ANYONE CAME FROM
OUTSIDEIF THEY DIDTHEY MUST HAVE GOT IN ACROSS THE BRIDGE BEFORE
SIX AND BEEN IN HIDING EVER SINCE UNTIL MR DOUGLAS CAME INTO THE
ROOM AFTER ELEVEN
THAT IS SO MR DOUGLAS WENT ROUND THE HOUSE EVERY NIGHT THE LAST
THING BEFORE HE TURNED IN TO SEE THAT THE LIGHTS WERE RIGHT THAT
BROUGHT HIM IN HERE THE MAN WAS WAITING AND SHOT HIM THEN HE GOT
AWAY THROUGH THE WINDOW AND LEFT HIS GUN BEHIND HIM THATS HOW I
READ IT FOR NOTHING ELSE WILL FIT THE FACTS
THE SERGEANT PICKED UP A CARD WHICH LAY BESIDE THE DEAD MAN ON THE
FLOOR THE INITIALS V V AND UNDER THEM THE NUMBER WERE RUDELY
SCRAWLED IN INK UPON IT
WHATS THIS HE ASKED HOLDING IT UP
BARKER LOOKED AT IT WITH CURIOSITY I NEVER NOTICED IT BEFORE HE
SAID THE MURDERER MUST HAVE LEFT IT BEHIND HIM
V V I CAN MAKE NO SENSE OF THAT
THE SERGEANT KEPT TURNING IT OVER IN HIS BIG FINGERS WHATS V V
SOMEBODYS INITIALS MAYBE WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE DR WOOD
IT WAS A GOODSIZED HAMMER WHICH HAD BEEN LYING ON THE RUG IN FRONT
OF THE FIREPLACEA SUBSTANTIAL WORKMANLIKE HAMMER CECIL BARKER
POINTED TO A BOX OF BRASSHEADED NAILS UPON THE MANTELPIECE
MR DOUGLAS WAS ALTERING THE PICTURES YESTERDAY HE SAID I SAW
HIM MYSELF STANDING UPON THAT CHAIR AND FIXING THE BIG PICTURE ABOVE
IT THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE HAMMER
WED BEST PUT IT BACK ON THE RUG WHERE WE FOUND IT SAID THE
SERGEANT SCRATCHING HIS PUZZLED HEAD IN HIS PERPLEXITY IT WILL
WANT THE BEST BRAINS IN THE FORCE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS THING
IT WILL BE A LONDON JOB BEFORE IT IS FINISHED HE RAISED THE HAND
LAMP AND WALKED SLOWLY ROUND THE ROOM HULLO HE CRIED EXCITEDLY
DRAWING THE WINDOW CURTAIN TO ONE SIDE WHAT OCLOCK WERE THOSE
CURTAINS DRAWN
WHEN THE LAMPS WERE LIT SAID THE BUTLER IT WOULD BE SHORTLY
AFTER FOUR
SOMEONE HAD BEEN HIDING HERE SURE ENOUGH HE HELD DOWN THE LIGHT
AND THE MARKS OF MUDDY BOOTS WERE VERY VISIBLE IN THE CORNER IM
BOUND TO SAY THIS BEARS OUT YOUR THEORY MR BARKER IT LOOKS AS IF
THE MAN GOT INTO THE HOUSE AFTER FOUR WHEN THE CURTAINS WERE DRAWN
AND BEFORE SIX WHEN THE BRIDGE WAS RAISED HE SLIPPED INTO THIS ROOM
BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST THAT HE SAW THERE WAS NO OTHER PLACE WHERE
HE COULD HIDE SO HE POPPED IN BEHIND THIS CURTAIN THAT ALL SEEMS
CLEAR ENOUGH IT IS LIKELY THAT HIS MAIN IDEA WAS TO BURGLE THE
HOUSE BUT MR DOUGLAS CHANCED TO COME UPON HIM SO HE MURDERED HIM
AND ESCAPED
THATS HOW I READ IT SAID BARKER BUT I SAY ARENT WE WASTING
PRECIOUS TIME COULDNT WE START OUT AND SCOUR THE COUNTRY BEFORE THE
FELLOW GETS AWAY
THE SERGEANT CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT
THERE ARE NO TRAINS BEFORE SIX IN THE MORNING SO HE CANT GET AWAY
BY RAIL IF HE GOES BY ROAD WITH HIS LEGS ALL DRIPPING ITS ODDS
THAT SOMEONE WILL NOTICE HIM ANYHOW I CANT LEAVE HERE MYSELF UNTIL
I AM RELIEVED BUT I THINK NONE OF YOU SHOULD GO UNTIL WE SEE MORE
CLEARLY HOW WE ALL STAND
THE DOCTOR HAD TAKEN THE LAMP AND WAS NARROWLY SCRUTINIZING THE BODY
WHATS THIS MARK HE ASKED COULD THIS HAVE ANY CONNECTION WITH
THE CRIME
THE DEAD MANS RIGHT ARM WAS THRUST OUT FROM HIS DRESSING GOWN AND
EXPOSED AS HIGH AS THE ELBOW ABOUT HALFWAY UP THE FOREARM WAS A
CURIOUS BROWN DESIGN A TRIANGLE INSIDE A CIRCLE STANDING OUT IN
VIVID RELIEF UPON THE LARDCOLOURED SKIN
ITS NOT TATTOOED SAID THE DOCTOR PEERING THROUGH HIS GLASSES I
NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT THE MAN HAS BEEN BRANDED AT SOME TIME AS
THEY BRAND CATTLE WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS
I DONT PROFESS TO KNOW THE MEANING OF IT SAID CECIL BARKER BUT
I HAVE SEEN THE MARK ON DOUGLAS MANY TIMES THIS LAST TEN YEARS
AND SO HAVE I SAID THE BUTLER MANY A TIME WHEN THE MASTER HAS
ROLLED UP HIS SLEEVES I HAVE NOTICED THAT VERY MARK IVE OFTEN
WONDERED WHAT IT COULD BE
THEN IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CRIME ANYHOW SAID THE
SERGEANT BUT ITS A RUM THING ALL THE SAME EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS
CASE IS RUM WELL WHAT IS IT NOW
THE BUTLER HAD GIVEN AN EXCLAMATION OF ASTONISHMENT AND WAS POINTING
AT THE DEAD MANS OUTSTRETCHED HAND
THEYVE TAKEN HIS WEDDING RING HE GASPED
WHAT
YES INDEED MASTER ALWAYS WORE HIS PLAIN GOLD WEDDING RING ON THE
LITTLE FINGER OF HIS LEFT HAND THAT RING WITH THE ROUGH NUGGET ON IT
WAS ABOVE IT AND THE TWISTED SNAKE RING ON THE THIRD FINGER THERES
THE NUGGET AND THERES THE SNAKE BUT THE WEDDING RING IS GONE
HES RIGHT SAID BARKER
DO YOU TELL ME SAID THE SERGEANT THAT THE WEDDING RING WAS BELOW
THE OTHER
ALWAYS
THEN THE MURDERER OR WHOEVER IT WAS FIRST TOOK OFF THIS RING YOU
CALL THE NUGGET RING THEN THE WEDDING RING AND AFTERWARDS PUT THE
NUGGET RING BACK AGAIN
THAT IS SO
THE WORTHY COUNTRY POLICEMAN SHOOK HIS HEAD SEEMS TO ME THE SOONER
WE GET LONDON ON TO THIS CASE THE BETTER SAID HE WHITE MASON IS A
SMART MAN NO LOCAL JOB HAS EVER BEEN TOO MUCH FOR WHITE MASON IT
WONT BE LONG NOW BEFORE HE IS HERE TO HELP US BUT I EXPECT WELL
HAVE TO LOOK TO LONDON BEFORE WE ARE THROUGH ANYHOW IM NOT ASHAMED
TO SAY THAT IT IS A DEAL TOO THICK FOR THE LIKES OF ME
CHAPTER IV
DARKNESS
AT THREE IN THE MORNING THE CHIEF SUSSEX DETECTIVE OBEYING THE
URGENT CALL FROM SERGEANT WILSON OF BIRLSTONE ARRIVED FROM
HEADQUARTERS IN A LIGHT DOGCART BEHIND A BREATHLESS TROTTER BY THE
FIVEFORTY TRAIN IN THE MORNING HE HAD SENT HIS MESSAGE TO SCOTLAND
YARD AND HE WAS AT THE BIRLSTONE STATION AT TWELVE OCLOCK TO
WELCOME US WHITE MASON WAS A QUIET COMFORTABLELOOKING PERSON IN A
LOOSE TWEED SUIT WITH A CLEANSHAVED RUDDY FACE A STOUTISH BODY
AND POWERFUL BANDY LEGS ADORNED WITH GAITERS LOOKING LIKE A SMALL
FARMER A RETIRED GAMEKEEPER OR ANYTHING UPON EARTH EXCEPT A VERY
FAVOURABLE SPECIMEN OF THE PROVINCIAL CRIMINAL OFFICER
A REAL DOWNRIGHT SNORTER MR MACDONALD HE KEPT REPEATING WELL
HAVE THE PRESSMEN DOWN LIKE FLIES WHEN THEY UNDERSTAND IT IM HOPING
WE WILL GET OUR WORK DONE BEFORE THEY GET POKING THEIR NOSES INTO IT
AND MESSING UP ALL THE TRAILS THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING LIKE THIS THAT
I CAN REMEMBER THERE ARE SOME BITS THAT WILL COME HOME TO YOU MR
HOLMES OR I AM MISTAKEN AND YOU ALSO DR WATSON FOR THE MEDICOS
WILL HAVE A WORD TO SAY BEFORE WE FINISH YOUR ROOM IS AT THE
WESTVILLE ARMS THERES NO OTHER PLACE BUT I HEAR THAT IT IS CLEAN
AND GOOD THE MAN WILL CARRY YOUR BAGS THIS WAY GENTLEMEN IF YOU
PLEASE
HE WAS A VERY BUSTLING AND GENIAL PERSON THIS SUSSEX DETECTIVE IN
TEN MINUTES WE HAD ALL FOUND OUR QUARTERS IN TEN MORE WE WERE SEATED
IN THE PARLOUR OF THE INN AND BEING TREATED TO A RAPID SKETCH OF
THOSE EVENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN OUTLINED IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER
MACDONALD MADE AN OCCASIONAL NOTE WHILE HOLMES SAT ABSORBED WITH
THE EXPRESSION OF SURPRISED AND REVERENT ADMIRATION WITH WHICH THE
BOTANIST SURVEYS THE RARE AND PRECIOUS BLOOM
REMARKABLE HE SAID WHEN THE STORY WAS UNFOLDED MOST REMARKABLE
I CAN HARDLY RECALL ANY CASE WHERE THE FEATURES HAVE BEEN MORE
PECULIAR
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD SAY SO MR HOLMES SAID WHITE MASON IN GREAT
DELIGHT WERE WELL UP WITH THE TIMES IN SUSSEX IVE TOLD YOU NOW
HOW MATTERS WERE UP TO THE TIME WHEN I TOOK OVER FROM SERGEANT
WILSON BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR THIS MORNING MY WORD I MADE THE OLD
MARE GO BUT I NEED NOT HAVE BEEN IN SUCH A HURRY AS IT TURNED OUT
FOR THERE WAS NOTHING IMMEDIATE THAT I COULD DO SERGEANT WILSON HAD
ALL THE FACTS I CHECKED THEM AND CONSIDERED THEM AND MAYBE ADDED A
FEW OF MY OWN
WHAT WERE THEY ASKED HOLMES EAGERLY
WELL I FIRST HAD THE HAMMER EXAMINED THERE WAS DR WOOD THERE TO
HELP ME WE FOUND NO SIGNS OF VIOLENCE UPON IT I WAS HOPING THAT IF
MR DOUGLAS DEFENDED HIMSELF WITH THE HAMMER HE MIGHT HAVE LEFT HIS
MARK UPON THE MURDERER BEFORE HE DROPPED IT ON THE MAT BUT THERE WAS
NO STAIN
THAT OF COURSE PROVES NOTHING AT ALL REMARKED INSPECTOR
MACDONALD THERE HAS BEEN MANY A HAMMER MURDER AND NO TRACE ON THE
HAMMER
QUITE SO IT DOESNT PROVE IT WASNT USED BUT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
STAINS AND THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED US AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE WERE
NONE THEN I EXAMINED THE GUN THEY WERE BUCKSHOT CARTRIDGES AND AS
SERGEANT WILSON POINTED OUT THE TRIGGERS WERE WIRED TOGETHER SO
THAT IF YOU PULLED ON THE HINDER ONE BOTH BARRELS WERE DISCHARGED
WHOEVER FIXED THAT UP HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WAS GOING TO TAKE
NO CHANCES OF MISSING HIS MAN THE SAWED GUN WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO
FOOT LONGONE COULD CARRY IT EASILY UNDER ONES COAT THERE WAS NO
COMPLETE MAKERS NAME BUT THE PRINTED LETTERS PEN WERE ON THE
FLUTING BETWEEN THE BARRELS AND THE REST OF THE NAME HAD BEEN CUT
OFF BY THE SAW
A BIG P WITH A FLOURISH ABOVE IT E AND N SMALLER ASKED HOLMES
EXACTLY
PENNSYLVANIA SMALL ARMS COMPANYWELLKNOWN AMERICAN FIRM SAID
HOLMES
WHITE MASON GAZED AT MY FRIEND AS THE LITTLE VILLAGE PRACTITIONER
LOOKS AT THE HARLEY STREET SPECIALIST WHO BY A WORD CAN SOLVE THE
DIFFICULTIES THAT PERPLEX HIM
THAT IS VERY HELPFUL MR HOLMES NO DOUBT YOU ARE RIGHT WONDERFUL
WONDERFUL DO YOU CARRY THE NAMES OF ALL THE GUN MAKERS IN THE WORLD
IN YOUR MEMORY
HOLMES DISMISSED THE SUBJECT WITH A WAVE
NO DOUBT IT IS AN AMERICAN SHOTGUN WHITE MASON CONTINUED I SEEM
TO HAVE READ THAT A SAWEDOFF SHOTGUN IS A WEAPON USED IN SOME PARTS
OF AMERICA APART FROM THE NAME UPON THE BARREL THE IDEA HAD
OCCURRED TO ME THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THEN THAT THIS MAN WHO
ENTERED THE HOUSE AND KILLED ITS MASTER WAS AN AMERICAN
MACDONALD SHOOK HIS HEAD MAN YOU ARE SURELY TRAVELLING OVERFAST
SAID HE I HAVE HEARD NO EVIDENCE YET THAT ANY STRANGER WAS EVER IN
THE HOUSE AT ALL
THE OPEN WINDOW THE BLOOD ON THE SILL THE QUEER CARD THE MARKS OF
BOOTS IN THE CORNER THE GUN
NOTHING THERE THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ARRANGED MR DOUGLAS WAS AN
AMERICAN OR HAD LIVED LONG IN AMERICA SO HAD MR BARKER YOU DONT
NEED TO IMPORT AN AMERICAN FROM OUTSIDE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR
AMERICAN DOINGS
AMES THE BUTLER
WHAT ABOUT HIM IS HE RELIABLE
TEN YEARS WITH SIR CHARLES CHANDOSAS SOLID AS A ROCK HE HAS BEEN
WITH DOUGLAS EVER SINCE HE TOOK THE MANOR HOUSE FIVE YEARS AGO HE
HAS NEVER SEEN A GUN OF THIS SORT IN THE HOUSE
THE GUN WAS MADE TO CONCEAL THATS WHY THE BARRELS WERE SAWED IT
WOULD FIT INTO ANY BOX HOW COULD HE SWEAR THERE WAS NO SUCH GUN IN
THE HOUSE
WELL ANYHOW HE HAD NEVER SEEN ONE
MACDONALD SHOOK HIS OBSTINATE SCOTCH HEAD IM NOT CONVINCED YET
THAT THERE WAS EVER ANYONE IN THE HOUSE SAID HE IM ASKING YOU TO
CONSEEDAR HIS ACCENT BECAME MORE ABERDONIAN AS HE LOST HIMSELF IN
HIS ARGUMENT IM ASKING YOU TO CONSEEDAR WHAT IT INVOLVES IF YOU
SUPPOSE THAT THIS GUN WAS EVER BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE AND THAT ALL
THESE STRANGE THINGS WERE DONE BY A PERSON FROM OUTSIDE OH MAN
ITS JUST INCONCEIVABLE ITS CLEAN AGAINST COMMON SENSE I PUT IT TO
YOU MR HOLMES JUDGING IT BY WHAT WE HAVE HEARD
WELL STATE YOUR CASE MR MAC SAID HOLMES IN HIS MOST JUDICIAL
STYLE
THE MAN IS NOT A BURGLAR SUPPOSING THAT HE EVER EXISTED THE RING
BUSINESS AND THE CARD POINT TO PREMEDITATED MURDER FOR SOME PRIVATE
REASON VERY GOOD HERE IS A MAN WHO SLIPS INTO A HOUSE WITH THE
DELIBERATE INTENTION OF COMMITTING MURDER HE KNOWS IF HE KNOWS
ANYTHING THAT HE WILL HAVE A DEEFICULTY IN MAKING HIS ESCAPE AS THE
HOUSE IS SURROUNDED WITH WATER WHAT WEAPON WOULD HE CHOOSE YOU
WOULD SAY THE MOST SILENT IN THE WORLD THEN HE COULD HOPE WHEN THE
DEED WAS DONE TO SLIP QUICKLY FROM THE WINDOW TO WADE THE MOAT AND
TO GET AWAY AT HIS LEISURE THATS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT IS IT
UNDERSTANDABLE THAT HE SHOULD GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO BRING WITH HIM THE
MOST NOISY WEAPON HE COULD SELECT KNOWING WELL THAT IT WILL FETCH
EVERY HUMAN BEING IN THE HOUSE TO THE SPOT AS QUICK AS THEY CAN RUN
AND THAT IT IS ALL ODDS THAT HE WILL BE SEEN BEFORE HE CAN GET ACROSS
THE MOAT IS THAT CREDIBLE MR HOLMES
WELL YOU PUT THE CASE STRONGLY MY FRIEND REPLIED THOUGHTFULLY
IT CERTAINLY NEEDS A GOOD DEAL OF JUSTIFICATION MAY I ASK MR
WHITE MASON WHETHER YOU EXAMINED THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE MOAT AT
ONCE TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY SIGNS OF THE MAN HAVING CLIMBED OUT
FROM THE WATER
THERE WERE NO SIGNS MR HOLMES BUT IT IS A STONE LEDGE AND ONE
COULD HARDLY EXPECT THEM
NO TRACKS OR MARKS
NONE
HA WOULD THERE BE ANY OBJECTION MR WHITE MASON TO OUR GOING DOWN
TO THE HOUSE AT ONCE THERE MAY POSSIBLY BE SOME SMALL POINT WHICH
MIGHT BE SUGGESTIVE
I WAS GOING TO PROPOSE IT MR HOLMES BUT I THOUGHT IT WELL TO PUT
YOU IN TOUCH WITH ALL THE FACTS BEFORE WE GO I SUPPOSE IF ANYTHING
SHOULD STRIKE YOU WHITE MASON LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT THE AMATEUR
I HAVE WORKED WITH MR HOLMES BEFORE SAID INSPECTOR MACDONALD HE
PLAYS THE GAME
MY OWN IDEA OF THE GAME AT ANY RATE SAID HOLMES WITH A SMILE I
GO INTO A CASE TO HELP THE ENDS OF JUSTICE AND THE WORK OF THE
POLICE IF I HAVE EVER SEPARATED MYSELF FROM THE OFFICIAL FORCE IT
IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE FIRST SEPARATED THEMSELVES FROM ME I HAVE NO
WISH EVER TO SCORE AT THEIR EXPENSE AT THE SAME TIME MR WHITE
MASON I CLAIM THE RIGHT TO WORK IN MY OWN WAY AND GIVE MY RESULTS AT
MY OWN TIMECOMPLETE RATHER THAN IN STAGES
I AM SURE WE ARE HONOURED BY YOUR PRESENCE AND TO SHOW YOU ALL WE
KNOW SAID WHITE MASON CORDIALLY COME ALONG DR WATSON AND WHEN
THE TIME COMES WELL ALL HOPE FOR A PLACE IN YOUR BOOK
WE WALKED DOWN THE QUAINT VILLAGE STREET WITH A ROW OF POLLARDED ELMS
ON EACH SIDE OF IT JUST BEYOND WERE TWO ANCIENT STONE PILLARS
WEATHERSTAINED AND LICHENBLOTCHED BEARING UPON THEIR SUMMITS A
SHAPELESS SOMETHING WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN THE RAMPANT LION OF CAPUS OF
BIRLSTONE A SHORT WALK ALONG THE WINDING DRIVE WITH SUCH SWARD AND
OAKS AROUND IT AS ONE ONLY SEES IN RURAL ENGLAND THEN A SUDDEN TURN
AND THE LONG LOW JACOBEAN HOUSE OF DINGY LIVERCOLOURED BRICK LAY
BEFORE US WITH AN OLDFASHIONED GARDEN OF CUT YEWS ON EACH SIDE OF
IT AS WE APPROACHED IT THERE WAS THE WOODEN DRAWBRIDGE AND THE
BEAUTIFUL BROAD MOAT AS STILL AND LUMINOUS AS QUICKSILVER IN THE
COLD WINTER SUNSHINE
THREE CENTURIES HAD FLOWED PAST THE OLD MANOR HOUSE CENTURIES OF
BIRTHS AND OF HOMECOMINGS OF COUNTRY DANCES AND OF THE MEETINGS OF
FOX HUNTERS STRANGE THAT NOW IN ITS OLD AGE THIS DARK BUSINESS
SHOULD HAVE CAST ITS SHADOW UPON THE VENERABLE WALLS AND YET THOSE
STRANGE PEAKED ROOFS AND QUAINT OVERHUNG GABLES WERE A FITTING
COVERING TO GRIM AND TERRIBLE INTRIGUE AS I LOOKED AT THE DEEPSET
WINDOWS AND THE LONG SWEEP OF THE DULLCOLOURED WATERLAPPED FRONT
I FELT THAT NO MORE FITTING SCENE COULD BE SET FOR SUCH A TRAGEDY
THATS THE WINDOW SAID WHITE MASON THAT ONE ON THE IMMEDIATE
RIGHT OF THE DRAWBRIDGE ITS OPEN JUST AS IT WAS FOUND LAST NIGHT
IT LOOKS RATHER NARROW FOR A MAN TO PASS
WELL IT WASNT A FAT MAN ANYHOW WE DONT NEED YOUR DEDUCTIONS
MR HOLMES TO TELL US THAT BUT YOU OR I COULD SQUEEZE THROUGH ALL
RIGHT
HOLMES WALKED TO THE EDGE OF THE MOAT AND LOOKED ACROSS THEN HE
EXAMINED THE STONE LEDGE AND THE GRASS BORDER BEYOND IT
IVE HAD A GOOD LOOK MR HOLMES SAID WHITE MASON THERE IS
NOTHING THERE NO SIGN THAT ANYONE HAS LANDEDBUT WHY SHOULD HE
LEAVE ANY SIGN
EXACTLY WHY SHOULD HE IS THE WATER ALWAYS TURBID
GENERALLY ABOUT THIS COLOUR THE STREAM BRINGS DOWN THE CLAY
HOW DEEP IS IT
ABOUT TWO FEET AT EACH SIDE AND THREE IN THE MIDDLE
SO WE CAN PUT ASIDE ALL IDEA OF THE MAN HAVING BEEN DROWNED IN
CROSSING
NO A CHILD COULD NOT BE DROWNED IN IT
WE WALKED ACROSS THE DRAWBRIDGE AND WERE ADMITTED BY A QUAINT
GNARLED DRIEDUP PERSON WHO WAS THE BUTLER AMES THE POOR OLD
FELLOW WAS WHITE AND QUIVERING FROM THE SHOCK THE VILLAGE SERGEANT
A TALL FORMAL MELANCHOLY MAN STILL HELD HIS VIGIL IN THE ROOM OF
FATE THE DOCTOR HAD DEPARTED
ANYTHING FRESH SERGEANT WILSON ASKED WHITE MASON
NO SIR
THEN YOU CAN GO HOME YOUVE HAD ENOUGH WE CAN SEND FOR YOU IF WE
WANT YOU THE BUTLER HAD BETTER WAIT OUTSIDE TELL HIM TO WARN MR
CECIL BARKER MRS DOUGLAS AND THE HOUSEKEEPER THAT WE MAY WANT A
WORD WITH THEM PRESENTLY NOW GENTLEMEN PERHAPS YOU WILL ALLOW ME
TO GIVE YOU THE VIEWS I HAVE FORMED FIRST AND THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO ARRIVE AT YOUR OWN
HE IMPRESSED ME THIS COUNTRY SPECIALIST HE HAD A SOLID GRIP OF FACT
AND A COOL CLEAR COMMONSENSE BRAIN WHICH SHOULD TAKE HIM SOME WAY
IN HIS PROFESSION HOLMES LISTENED TO HIM INTENTLY WITH NO SIGN OF
THAT IMPATIENCE WHICH THE OFFICIAL EXPONENT TOO OFTEN PRODUCED
IS IT SUICIDE OR IS IT MURDERTHATS OUR FIRST QUESTION
GENTLEMEN IS IT NOT IF IT WERE SUICIDE THEN WE HAVE TO BELIEVE
THAT THIS MAN BEGAN BY TAKING OFF HIS WEDDING RING AND CONCEALING IT
THAT HE THEN CAME DOWN HERE IN HIS DRESSING GOWN TRAMPLED MUD INTO A
CORNER BEHIND THE CURTAIN IN ORDER TO GIVE THE IDEA SOMEONE HAD
WAITED FOR HIM OPENED THE WINDOW PUT BLOOD ON THE
WE CAN SURELY DISMISS THAT SAID MACDONALD
SO I THINK SUICIDE IS OUT OF THE QUESTION THEN A MURDER HAS BEEN
DONE WHAT WE HAVE TO DETERMINE IS WHETHER IT WAS DONE BY SOMEONE
OUTSIDE OR INSIDE THE HOUSE
WELL LETS HEAR THE ARGUMENT
THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTIES BOTH WAYS AND YET ONE OR THE
OTHER IT MUST BE WE WILL SUPPOSE FIRST THAT SOME PERSON OR PERSONS
INSIDE THE HOUSE DID THE CRIME THEY GOT THIS MAN DOWN HERE AT A TIME
WHEN EVERYTHING WAS STILL AND YET NO ONE WAS ASLEEP THEY THEN DID
THE DEED WITH THE QUEEREST AND NOISIEST WEAPON IN THE WORLD SO AS TO
TELL EVERYONE WHAT HAD HAPPENEDA WEAPON THAT WAS NEVER SEEN IN THE
HOUSE BEFORE THAT DOES NOT SEEM A VERY LIKELY START DOES IT
NO IT DOES NOT
WELL THEN EVERYONE IS AGREED THAT AFTER THE ALARM WAS GIVEN ONLY A
MINUTE AT THE MOST HAD PASSED BEFORE THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLDNOT MR
CECIL BARKER ALONE THOUGH HE CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST BUT AMES
AND ALL OF THEM WERE ON THE SPOT DO YOU TELL ME THAT IN THAT TIME
THE GUILTY PERSON MANAGED TO MAKE FOOTMARKS IN THE CORNER OPEN THE
WINDOW MARK THE SILL WITH BLOOD TAKE THE WEDDING RING OFF THE DEAD
MANS FINGER AND ALL THE REST OF IT ITS IMPOSSIBLE
YOU PUT IT VERY CLEARLY SAID HOLMES I AM INCLINED TO AGREE WITH
YOU
WELL THEN WE ARE DRIVEN BACK TO THE THEORY THAT IT WAS DONE BY
SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE WE ARE STILL FACED WITH SOME BIG DIFFICULTIES
BUT ANYHOW THEY HAVE CEASED TO BE IMPOSSIBILITIES THE MAN GOT INTO
THE HOUSE BETWEEN FOURTHIRTY AND SIX THAT IS TO SAY BETWEEN DUSK
AND THE TIME WHEN THE BRIDGE WAS RAISED THERE HAD BEEN SOME
VISITORS AND THE DOOR WAS OPEN SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO PREVENT HIM
HE MAY HAVE BEEN A COMMON BURGLAR OR HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME PRIVATE
GRUDGE AGAINST MR DOUGLAS SINCE MR DOUGLAS HAS SPENT MOST OF HIS
LIFE IN AMERICA AND THIS SHOTGUN SEEMS TO BE AN AMERICAN WEAPON IT
WOULD SEEM THAT THE PRIVATE GRUDGE IS THE MORE LIKELY THEORY HE
SLIPPED INTO THIS ROOM BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST HE CAME TO AND HE
HID BEHIND THE CURTAIN THERE HE REMAINED UNTIL PAST ELEVEN AT NIGHT
AT THAT TIME MR DOUGLAS ENTERED THE ROOM IT WAS A SHORT INTERVIEW
IF THERE WERE ANY INTERVIEW AT ALL FOR MRS DOUGLAS DECLARES THAT
HER HUSBAND HAD NOT LEFT HER MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES WHEN SHE HEARD
THE SHOT
THE CANDLE SHOWS THAT SAID HOLMES
EXACTLY THE CANDLE WHICH WAS A NEW ONE IS NOT BURNED MORE THAN
HALF AN INCH HE MUST HAVE PLACED IT ON THE TABLE BEFORE HE WAS
ATTACKED OTHERWISE OF COURSE IT WOULD HAVE FALLEN WHEN HE FELL
THIS SHOWS THAT HE WAS NOT ATTACKED THE INSTANT THAT HE ENTERED THE
ROOM WHEN MR BARKER ARRIVED THE CANDLE WAS LIT AND THE LAMP WAS
OUT
THATS ALL CLEAR ENOUGH
WELL NOW WE CAN RECONSTRUCT THINGS ON THOSE LINES MR DOUGLAS
ENTERS THE ROOM HE PUTS DOWN THE CANDLE A MAN APPEARS FROM BEHIND
THE CURTAIN HE IS ARMED WITH THIS GUN HE DEMANDS THE WEDDING
RINGHEAVEN ONLY KNOWS WHY BUT SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN MR DOUGLAS
GAVE IT UP THEN EITHER IN COLD BLOOD OR IN THE COURSE OF A
STRUGGLEDOUGLAS MAY HAVE GRIPPED THE HAMMER THAT WAS FOUND UPON THE
MATHE SHOT DOUGLAS IN THIS HORRIBLE WAY HE DROPPED HIS GUN AND
ALSO IT WOULD SEEM THIS QUEER CARDV V WHATEVER THAT MAY
MEANAND HE MADE HIS ESCAPE THROUGH THE WINDOW AND ACROSS THE MOAT
AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN CECIL BARKER WAS DISCOVERING THE CRIME HOWS
THAT MR HOLMES
VERY INTERESTING BUT JUST A LITTLE UNCONVINCING
MAN IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTE NONSENSE IF IT WASNT THAT ANYTHING ELSE
IS EVEN WORSE CRIED MACDONALD SOMEBODY KILLED THE MAN AND
WHOEVER IT WAS I COULD CLEARLY PROVE TO YOU THAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE
IT SOME OTHER WAY WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY ALLOWING HIS RETREAT TO BE
CUT OFF LIKE THAT WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY USING A SHOTGUN WHEN SILENCE
WAS HIS ONE CHANCE OF ESCAPE COME MR HOLMES ITS UP TO YOU TO
GIVE US A LEAD SINCE YOU SAY MR WHITE MASONS THEORY IS
UNCONVINCING
HOLMES HAD SAT INTENTLY OBSERVANT DURING THIS LONG DISCUSSION
MISSING NO WORD THAT WAS SAID WITH HIS KEEN EYES DARTING TO RIGHT
AND TO LEFT AND HIS FOREHEAD WRINKLED WITH SPECULATION
I SHOULD LIKE A FEW MORE FACTS BEFORE I GET SO FAR AS A THEORY MR
MAC SAID HE KNEELING DOWN BESIDE THE BODY DEAR ME THESE
INJURIES ARE REALLY APPALLING CAN WE HAVE THE BUTLER IN FOR A
MOMENT AMES I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE OFTEN SEEN THIS VERY
UNUSUAL MARKA BRANDED TRIANGLE INSIDE A CIRCLEUPON MR DOUGLASS
FOREARM
FREQUENTLY SIR
YOU NEVER HEARD ANY SPECULATION AS TO WHAT IT MEANT
NO SIR
IT MUST HAVE CAUSED GREAT PAIN WHEN IT WAS INFLICTED IT IS
UNDOUBTEDLY A BURN NOW I OBSERVE AMES THAT THERE IS A SMALL PIECE
OF PLASTER AT THE ANGLE OF MR DOUGLASS JAW DID YOU OBSERVE THAT IN
LIFE
YES SIR HE CUT HIMSELF IN SHAVING YESTERDAY MORNING
DID YOU EVER KNOW HIM TO CUT HIMSELF IN SHAVING BEFORE
NOT FOR A VERY LONG TIME SIR
SUGGESTIVE SAID HOLMES IT MAY OF COURSE BE A MERE COINCIDENCE
OR IT MAY POINT TO SOME NERVOUSNESS WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT HE HAD
REASON TO APPREHEND DANGER HAD YOU NOTICED ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN HIS
CONDUCT YESTERDAY AMES
IT STRUCK ME THAT HE WAS A LITTLE RESTLESS AND EXCITED SIR
HA THE ATTACK MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED WE DO SEEM TO
MAKE A LITTLE PROGRESS DO WE NOT PERHAPS YOU WOULD RATHER DO THE
QUESTIONING MR MAC
NO MR HOLMES ITS IN BETTER HANDS THAN MINE
WELL THEN WE WILL PASS TO THIS CARDV V IT IS ROUGH
CARDBOARD HAVE YOU ANY OF THE SORT IN THE HOUSE
I DONT THINK SO
HOLMES WALKED ACROSS TO THE DESK AND DABBED A LITTLE INK FROM EACH
BOTTLE ON TO THE BLOTTING PAPER IT WAS NOT PRINTED IN THIS ROOM
HE SAID THIS IS BLACK INK AND THE OTHER PURPLISH IT WAS DONE BY A
THICK PEN AND THESE ARE FINE NO IT WAS DONE ELSEWHERE I SHOULD
SAY CAN YOU MAKE ANYTHING OF THE INSCRIPTION AMES
NO SIR NOTHING
WHAT DO YOU THINK MR MAC
IT GIVES ME THE IMPRESSION OF A SECRET SOCIETY OF SOME SORT THE
SAME WITH HIS BADGE UPON THE FOREARM
THATS MY IDEA TOO SAID WHITE MASON
WELL WE CAN ADOPT IT AS A WORKING HYPOTHESIS AND THEN SEE HOW FAR
OUR DIFFICULTIES DISAPPEAR AN AGENT FROM SUCH A SOCIETY MAKES HIS
WAY INTO THE HOUSE WAITS FOR MR DOUGLAS BLOWS HIS HEAD NEARLY OFF
WITH THIS WEAPON AND ESCAPES BY WADING THE MOAT AFTER LEAVING A
CARD BESIDE THE DEAD MAN WHICH WILL WHEN MENTIONED IN THE PAPERS
TELL OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY THAT VENGEANCE HAS BEEN DONE THAT
ALL HANGS TOGETHER BUT WHY THIS GUN OF ALL WEAPONS
EXACTLY
AND WHY THE MISSING RING
QUITE SO
AND WHY NO ARREST ITS PAST TWO NOW I TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT
SINCE DAWN EVERY CONSTABLE WITHIN FORTY MILES HAS BEEN LOOKING OUT
FOR A WET STRANGER
THAT IS SO MR HOLMES
WELL UNLESS HE HAS A BURROW CLOSE BY OR A CHANGE OF CLOTHES READY
THEY CAN HARDLY MISS HIM AND YET THEY HAVE MISSED HIM UP TO NOW
HOLMES HAD GONE TO THE WINDOW AND WAS EXAMINING WITH HIS LENS THE
BLOOD MARK ON THE SILL IT IS CLEARLY THE TREAD OF A SHOE IT IS
REMARKABLY BROAD A SPLAYFOOT ONE WOULD SAY CURIOUS BECAUSE SO
FAR AS ONE CAN TRACE ANY FOOTMARK IN THIS MUDSTAINED CORNER ONE
WOULD SAY IT WAS A MORE SHAPELY SOLE HOWEVER THEY ARE CERTAINLY
VERY INDISTINCT WHATS THIS UNDER THE SIDE TABLE
MR DOUGLASS DUMBBELLS SAID AMES
DUMBBELLTHERES ONLY ONE WHERES THE OTHER
I DONT KNOW MR HOLMES THERE MAY HAVE BEEN ONLY ONE I HAVE NOT
NOTICED THEM FOR MONTHS
ONE DUMBBELL HOLMES SAID SERIOUSLY BUT HIS REMARKS WERE
INTERRUPTED BY A SHARP KNOCK AT THE DOOR
A TALL SUNBURNED CAPABLELOOKING CLEANSHAVED MAN LOOKED IN AT US
I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN GUESSING THAT IT WAS THE CECIL BARKER OF WHOM
I HAD HEARD HIS MASTERFUL EYES TRAVELLED QUICKLY WITH A QUESTIONING
GLANCE FROM FACE TO FACE
SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOUR CONSULTATION SAID HE BUT YOU SHOULD HEAR
THE LATEST NEWS
AN ARREST
NO SUCH LUCK BUT THEYVE FOUND HIS BICYCLE THE FELLOW LEFT HIS
BICYCLE BEHIND HIM COME AND HAVE A LOOK IT IS WITHIN A HUNDRED
YARDS OF THE HALL DOOR
WE FOUND THREE OR FOUR GROOMS AND IDLERS STANDING IN THE DRIVE
INSPECTING A BICYCLE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN OUT FROM A CLUMP OF
EVERGREENS IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN CONCEALED IT WAS A WELL USED
RUDGEWHITWORTH SPLASHED AS FROM A CONSIDERABLE JOURNEY THERE WAS A
SADDLEBAG WITH SPANNER AND OILCAN BUT NO CLUE AS TO THE OWNER
IT WOULD BE A GRAND HELP TO THE POLICE SAID THE INSPECTOR IF
THESE THINGS WERE NUMBERED AND REGISTERED BUT WE MUST BE THANKFUL
FOR WHAT WEVE GOT IF WE CANT FIND WHERE HE WENT TO AT LEAST WE
ARE LIKELY TO GET WHERE HE CAME FROM BUT WHAT IN THE NAME OF ALL
THAT IS WONDERFUL MADE THE FELLOW LEAVE IT BEHIND AND HOW IN THE
WORLD HAS HE GOT AWAY WITHOUT IT WE DONT SEEM TO GET A GLEAM OF
LIGHT IN THE CASE MR HOLMES
DONT WE MY FRIEND ANSWERED THOUGHTFULLY I WONDER
CHAPTER V
THE PEOPLE OF THE DRAMA
HAVE YOU SEEN ALL YOU WANT OF THE STUDY ASKED WHITE MASON AS WE
REENTERED THE HOUSE
FOR THE TIME SAID THE INSPECTOR AND HOLMES NODDED
THEN PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOW LIKE TO HEAR THE EVIDENCE OF SOME OF THE
PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE WE COULD USE THE DININGROOM AMES PLEASE COME
YOURSELF FIRST AND TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW
THE BUTLERS ACCOUNT WAS A SIMPLE AND A CLEAR ONE AND HE GAVE A
CONVINCING IMPRESSION OF SINCERITY HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED FIVE YEARS
BEFORE WHEN DOUGLAS FIRST CAME TO BIRLSTONE HE UNDERSTOOD THAT MR
DOUGLAS WAS A RICH GENTLEMAN WHO HAD MADE HIS MONEY IN AMERICA HE
HAD BEEN A KIND AND CONSIDERATE EMPLOYERNOT QUITE WHAT AMES WAS
USED TO PERHAPS BUT ONE CANT HAVE EVERYTHING HE NEVER SAW ANY
SIGNS OF APPREHENSION IN MR DOUGLAS ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS THE
MOST FEARLESS MAN HE HAD EVER KNOWN HE ORDERED THE DRAWBRIDGE TO BE
PULLED UP EVERY NIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS THE ANCIENT CUSTOM OF THE OLD
HOUSE AND HE LIKED TO KEEP THE OLD WAYS UP
MR DOUGLAS SELDOM WENT TO LONDON OR LEFT THE VILLAGE BUT ON THE DAY
BEFORE THE CRIME HE HAD BEEN SHOPPING AT TUNBRIDGE WELLS HE AMES
HAD OBSERVED SOME RESTLESSNESS AND EXCITEMENT ON THE PART OF MR
DOUGLAS THAT DAY FOR HE HAD SEEMED IMPATIENT AND IRRITABLE WHICH
WAS UNUSUAL WITH HIM HE HAD NOT GONE TO BED THAT NIGHT BUT WAS IN
THE PANTRY AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE PUTTING AWAY THE SILVER WHEN HE
HEARD THE BELL RING VIOLENTLY HE HEARD NO SHOT BUT IT WAS HARDLY
POSSIBLE HE WOULD AS THE PANTRY AND KITCHENS WERE AT THE VERY BACK
OF THE HOUSE AND THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOSED DOORS AND A LONG PASSAGE
BETWEEN THE HOUSEKEEPER HAD COME OUT OF HER ROOM ATTRACTED BY THE
VIOLENT RINGING OF THE BELL THEY HAD GONE TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE
TOGETHER
AS THEY REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIR HE HAD SEEN MRS DOUGLAS
COMING DOWN IT NO SHE WAS NOT HURRYING IT DID NOT SEEM TO HIM THAT
SHE WAS PARTICULARLY AGITATED JUST AS SHE REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE
STAIR MR BARKER HAD RUSHED OUT OF THE STUDY HE HAD STOPPED MRS
DOUGLAS AND BEGGED HER TO GO BACK
FOR GODS SAKE GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM HE CRIED POOR JACK IS DEAD
YOU CAN DO NOTHING FOR GODS SAKE GO BACK
AFTER SOME PERSUASION UPON THE STAIRS MRS DOUGLAS HAD GONE BACK SHE
DID NOT SCREAM SHE MADE NO OUTCRY WHATEVER MRS ALLEN THE
HOUSEKEEPER HAD TAKEN HER UPSTAIRS AND STAYED WITH HER IN THE
BEDROOM AMES AND MR BARKER HAD THEN RETURNED TO THE STUDY WHERE
THEY HAD FOUND EVERYTHING EXACTLY AS THE POLICE HAD SEEN IT THE
CANDLE WAS NOT LIT AT THAT TIME BUT THE LAMP WAS BURNING THEY HAD
LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW BUT THE NIGHT WAS VERY DARK AND NOTHING
COULD BE SEEN OR HEARD THEY HAD THEN RUSHED OUT INTO THE HALL WHERE
AMES HAD TURNED THE WINDLASS WHICH LOWERED THE DRAWBRIDGE MR BARKER
HAD THEN HURRIED OFF TO GET THE POLICE
SUCH IN ITS ESSENTIALS WAS THE EVIDENCE OF THE BUTLER
THE ACCOUNT OF MRS ALLEN THE HOUSEKEEPER WAS SO FAR AS IT WENT A
CORROBORATION OF THAT OF HER FELLOW SERVANT THE HOUSEKEEPERS ROOM
WAS RATHER NEARER TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE THAN THE PANTRY IN WHICH
AMES HAD BEEN WORKING SHE WAS PREPARING TO GO TO BED WHEN THE LOUD
RINGING OF THE BELL HAD ATTRACTED HER ATTENTION SHE WAS A LITTLE
HARD OF HEARING PERHAPS THAT WAS WHY SHE HAD NOT HEARD THE SHOT BUT
IN ANY CASE THE STUDY WAS A LONG WAY OFF SHE REMEMBERED HEARING SOME
SOUND WHICH SHE IMAGINED TO BE THE SLAMMING OF A DOOR THAT WAS A
GOOD DEAL EARLIERHALF AN HOUR AT LEAST BEFORE THE RINGING OF THE
BELL WHEN MR AMES RAN TO THE FRONT SHE WENT WITH HIM SHE SAW MR
BARKER VERY PALE AND EXCITED COME OUT OF THE STUDY HE INTERCEPTED
MRS DOUGLAS WHO WAS COMING DOWN THE STAIRS HE ENTREATED HER TO GO
BACK AND SHE ANSWERED HIM BUT WHAT SHE SAID COULD NOT BE HEARD
TAKE HER UP STAY WITH HER HE HAD SAID TO MRS ALLEN
SHE HAD THEREFORE TAKEN HER TO THE BEDROOM AND ENDEAVOURED TO SOOTHE
HER SHE WAS GREATLY EXCITED TREMBLING ALL OVER BUT MADE NO OTHER
ATTEMPT TO GO DOWNSTAIRS SHE JUST SAT IN HER DRESSING GOWN BY HER
BEDROOM FIRE WITH HER HEAD SUNK IN HER HANDS MRS ALLEN STAYED WITH
HER MOST OF THE NIGHT AS TO THE OTHER SERVANTS THEY HAD ALL GONE TO
BED AND THE ALARM DID NOT REACH THEM UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE POLICE
ARRIVED THEY SLEPT AT THE EXTREME BACK OF THE HOUSE AND COULD NOT
POSSIBLY HAVE HEARD ANYTHING
SO FAR THE HOUSEKEEPER COULD ADD NOTHING ON CROSSEXAMINATION SAVE
LAMENTATIONS AND EXPRESSIONS OF AMAZEMENT
CECIL BARKER SUCCEEDED MRS ALLEN AS A WITNESS AS TO THE OCCURRENCES
OF THE NIGHT BEFORE HE HAD VERY LITTLE TO ADD TO WHAT HE HAD ALREADY
TOLD THE POLICE PERSONALLY HE WAS CONVINCED THAT THE MURDERER HAD
ESCAPED BY THE WINDOW THE BLOODSTAIN WAS CONCLUSIVE IN HIS OPINION
ON THAT POINT BESIDES AS THE BRIDGE WAS UP THERE WAS NO OTHER
POSSIBLE WAY OF ESCAPING HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE
ASSASSIN OR WHY HE HAD NOT TAKEN HIS BICYCLE IF IT WERE INDEED HIS
HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN DROWNED IN THE MOAT WHICH WAS AT NO
PLACE MORE THAN THREE FEET DEEP
IN HIS OWN MIND HE HAD A VERY DEFINITE THEORY ABOUT THE MURDER
DOUGLAS WAS A RETICENT MAN AND THERE WERE SOME CHAPTERS IN HIS LIFE
OF WHICH HE NEVER SPOKE HE HAD EMIGRATED TO AMERICA WHEN HE WAS A
VERY YOUNG MAN HE HAD PROSPERED WELL AND BARKER HAD FIRST MET HIM
IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY HAD BECOME PARTNERS IN A SUCCESSFUL MINING
CLAIM AT A PLACE CALLED BENITO CANYON THEY HAD DONE VERY WELL BUT
DOUGLAS HAD SUDDENLY SOLD OUT AND STARTED FOR ENGLAND HE WAS A
WIDOWER AT THAT TIME BARKER HAD AFTERWARDS REALIZED HIS MONEY AND
COME TO LIVE IN LONDON THUS THEY HAD RENEWED THEIR FRIENDSHIP
DOUGLAS HAD GIVEN HIM THE IMPRESSION THAT SOME DANGER WAS HANGING
OVER HIS HEAD AND HE HAD ALWAYS LOOKED UPON HIS SUDDEN DEPARTURE
FROM CALIFORNIA AND ALSO HIS RENTING A HOUSE IN SO QUIET A PLACE IN
ENGLAND AS BEING CONNECTED WITH THIS PERIL HE IMAGINED THAT SOME
SECRET SOCIETY SOME IMPLACABLE ORGANIZATION WAS ON DOUGLASS TRACK
WHICH WOULD NEVER REST UNTIL IT KILLED HIM SOME REMARKS OF HIS HAD
GIVEN HIM THIS IDEA THOUGH HE HAD NEVER TOLD HIM WHAT THE SOCIETY
WAS NOR HOW HE HAD COME TO OFFEND IT HE COULD ONLY SUPPOSE THAT THE
LEGEND UPON THE PLACARD HAD SOME REFERENCE TO THIS SECRET SOCIETY
HOW LONG WERE YOU WITH DOUGLAS IN CALIFORNIA ASKED INSPECTOR
MACDONALD
FIVE YEARS ALTOGETHER
HE WAS A BACHELOR YOU SAY
A WIDOWER
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD WHERE HIS FIRST WIFE CAME FROM
NO I REMEMBER HIS SAYING THAT SHE WAS OF GERMAN EXTRACTION AND I
HAVE SEEN HER PORTRAIT SHE WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SHE DIED OF
TYPHOID THE YEAR BEFORE I MET HIM
YOU DONT ASSOCIATE HIS PAST WITH ANY PARTICULAR PART OF AMERICA
I HAVE HEARD HIM TALK OF CHICAGO HE KNEW THAT CITY WELL AND HAD
WORKED THERE I HAVE HEARD HIM TALK OF THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS
HE HAD TRAVELLED A GOOD DEAL IN HIS TIME
WAS HE A POLITICIAN HAD THIS SECRET SOCIETY TO DO WITH POLITICS
NO HE CARED NOTHING ABOUT POLITICS
YOU HAVE NO REASON TO THINK IT WAS CRIMINAL
ON THE CONTRARY I NEVER MET A STRAIGHTER MAN IN MY LIFE
WAS THERE ANYTHING CURIOUS ABOUT HIS LIFE IN CALIFORNIA
HE LIKED BEST TO STAY AND TO WORK AT OUR CLAIM IN THE MOUNTAINS HE
WOULD NEVER GO WHERE OTHER MEN WERE IF HE COULD HELP IT THATS WHY I
FIRST THOUGHT THAT SOMEONE WAS AFTER HIM THEN WHEN HE LEFT SO
SUDDENLY FOR EUROPE I MADE SURE THAT IT WAS SO I BELIEVE THAT HE HAD
A WARNING OF SOME SORT WITHIN A WEEK OF HIS LEAVING HALF A DOZEN MEN
WERE INQUIRING FOR HIM
WHAT SORT OF MEN
WELL THEY WERE A MIGHTY HARDLOOKING CROWD THEY CAME UP TO THE
CLAIM AND WANTED TO KNOW WHERE HE WAS I TOLD THEM THAT HE WAS GONE
TO EUROPE AND THAT I DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO FIND HIM THEY MEANT HIM
NO GOODIT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT
WERE THESE MEN AMERICANSCALIFORNIANS
WELL I DONT KNOW ABOUT CALIFORNIANS THEY WERE AMERICANS ALL
RIGHT BUT THEY WERE NOT MINERS I DONT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE AND WAS
VERY GLAD TO SEE THEIR BACKS
THAT WAS SIX YEARS AGO
NEARER SEVEN
AND THEN YOU WERE TOGETHER FIVE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT THIS
BUSINESS DATES BACK NOT LESS THAN ELEVEN YEARS AT THE LEAST
THAT IS SO
IT MUST BE A VERY SERIOUS FEUD THAT WOULD BE KEPT UP WITH SUCH
EARNESTNESS FOR AS LONG AS THAT IT WOULD BE NO LIGHT THING THAT
WOULD GIVE RISE TO IT
I THINK IT SHADOWED HIS WHOLE LIFE IT WAS NEVER QUITE OUT OF HIS
MIND
BUT IF A MAN HAD A DANGER HANGING OVER HIM AND KNEW WHAT IT WAS
DONT YOU THINK HE WOULD TURN TO THE POLICE FOR PROTECTION
MAYBE IT WAS SOME DANGER THAT HE COULD NOT BE PROTECTED AGAINST
THERES ONE THING YOU SHOULD KNOW HE ALWAYS WENT ABOUT ARMED HIS
REVOLVER WAS NEVER OUT OF HIS POCKET BUT BY BAD LUCK HE WAS IN HIS
DRESSING GOWN AND HAD LEFT IT IN THE BEDROOM LAST NIGHT ONCE THE
BRIDGE WAS UP I GUESS HE THOUGHT HE WAS SAFE
I SHOULD LIKE THESE DATES A LITTLE CLEARER SAID MACDONALD IT IS
QUITE SIX YEARS SINCE DOUGLAS LEFT CALIFORNIA YOU FOLLOWED HIM NEXT
YEAR DID YOU NOT
THAT IS SO
AND HE HAD BEEN MARRIED FIVE YEARS YOU MUST HAVE RETURNED ABOUT THE
TIME OF HIS MARRIAGE
ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE I WAS HIS BEST MAN
DID YOU KNOW MRS DOUGLAS BEFORE HER MARRIAGE
NO I DID NOT I HAD BEEN AWAY FROM ENGLAND FOR TEN YEARS
BUT YOU HAVE SEEN A GOOD DEAL OF HER SINCE
BARKER LOOKED STERNLY AT THE DETECTIVE I HAVE SEEN A GOOD DEAL OF
HIM SINCE HE ANSWERED IF I HAVE SEEN HER IT IS BECAUSE YOU
CANNOT VISIT A MAN WITHOUT KNOWING HIS WIFE IF YOU IMAGINE THERE IS
ANY CONNECTION
I IMAGINE NOTHING MR BARKER I AM BOUND TO MAKE EVERY INQUIRY
WHICH CAN BEAR UPON THE CASE BUT I MEAN NO OFFENSE
SOME INQUIRIES ARE OFFENSIVE BARKER ANSWERED ANGRILY
ITS ONLY THE FACTS THAT WE WANT IT IS IN YOUR INTEREST AND
EVERYONES INTEREST THAT THEY SHOULD BE CLEARED UP DID MR DOUGLAS
ENTIRELY APPROVE YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH HIS WIFE
BARKER GREW PALER AND HIS GREAT STRONG HANDS WERE CLASPED
CONVULSIVELY TOGETHER YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK SUCH QUESTIONS HE
CRIED WHAT HAS THIS TO DO WITH THE MATTER YOU ARE INVESTIGATING
I MUST REPEAT THE QUESTION
WELL I REFUSE TO ANSWER
YOU CAN REFUSE TO ANSWER BUT YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT YOUR REFUSAL IS
IN ITSELF AN ANSWER FOR YOU WOULD NOT REFUSE IF YOU HAD NOT
SOMETHING TO CONCEAL
BARKER STOOD FOR A MOMENT WITH HIS FACE SET GRIMLY AND HIS STRONG
BLACK EYEBROWS DRAWN LOW IN INTENSE THOUGHT THEN HE LOOKED UP WITH A
SMILE WELL I GUESS YOU GENTLEMEN ARE ONLY DOING YOUR CLEAR DUTY
AFTER ALL AND I HAVE NO RIGHT TO STAND IN THE WAY OF IT ID ONLY
ASK YOU NOT TO WORRY MRS DOUGLAS OVER THIS MATTER FOR SHE HAS
ENOUGH UPON HER JUST NOW I MAY TELL YOU THAT POOR DOUGLAS HAD JUST
ONE FAULT IN THE WORLD AND THAT WAS HIS JEALOUSY HE WAS FOND OF
MENO MAN COULD BE FONDER OF A FRIEND AND HE WAS DEVOTED TO HIS
WIFE HE LOVED ME TO COME HERE AND WAS FOREVER SENDING FOR ME AND
YET IF HIS WIFE AND I TALKED TOGETHER OR THERE SEEMED ANY SYMPATHY
BETWEEN US A KIND OF WAVE OF JEALOUSY WOULD PASS OVER HIM AND HE
WOULD BE OFF THE HANDLE AND SAYING THE WILDEST THINGS IN A MOMENT
MORE THAN ONCE IVE SWORN OFF COMING FOR THAT REASON AND THEN HE
WOULD WRITE ME SUCH PENITENT IMPLORING LETTERS THAT I JUST HAD TO
BUT YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM ME GENTLEMEN IF IT WAS MY LAST WORD THAT
NO MAN EVER HAD A MORE LOVING FAITHFUL WIFEAND I CAN SAY ALSO NO
FRIEND COULD BE MORE LOYAL THAN I
IT WAS SPOKEN WITH FERVOUR AND FEELING AND YET INSPECTOR MACDONALD
COULD NOT DISMISS THE SUBJECT
YOU ARE AWARE SAID HE THAT THE DEAD MANS WEDDING RING HAS BEEN
TAKEN FROM HIS FINGER
SO IT APPEARS SAID BARKER
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY APPEARS YOU KNOW IT AS A FACT
THE MAN SEEMED CONFUSED AND UNDECIDED WHEN I SAID APPEARS I MEANT
THAT IT WAS CONCEIVABLE THAT HE HAD HIMSELF TAKEN OFF THE RING
THE MERE FACT THAT THE RING SHOULD BE ABSENT WHOEVER MAY HAVE
REMOVED IT WOULD SUGGEST TO ANYONES MIND WOULD IT NOT THAT THE
MARRIAGE AND THE TRAGEDY WERE CONNECTED
BARKER SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS I CANT PROFESS TO SAY WHAT IT
MEANS HE ANSWERED BUT IF YOU MEAN TO HINT THAT IT COULD REFLECT
IN ANY WAY UPON THIS LADYS HONOURHIS EYES BLAZED FOR AN INSTANT
AND THEN WITH AN EVIDENT EFFORT HE GOT A GRIP UPON HIS OWN
EMOTIONSWELL YOU ARE ON THE WRONG TRACK THATS ALL
I DONT KNOW THAT IVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ASK YOU AT PRESENT SAID
MACDONALD COLDLY
THERE WAS ONE SMALL POINT REMARKED SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN YOU
ENTERED THE ROOM THERE WAS ONLY A CANDLE LIGHTED ON THE TABLE WAS
THERE NOT
YES THAT WAS SO
BY ITS LIGHT YOU SAW THAT SOME TERRIBLE INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED
EXACTLY
YOU AT ONCE RANG FOR HELP
YES
AND IT ARRIVED VERY SPEEDILY
WITHIN A MINUTE OR SO
AND YET WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY FOUND THAT THE CANDLE WAS OUT AND
THAT THE LAMP HAD BEEN LIGHTED THAT SEEMS VERY REMARKABLE
AGAIN BARKER SHOWED SOME SIGNS OF INDECISION I DONT SEE THAT IT
WAS REMARKABLE MR HOLMES HE ANSWERED AFTER A PAUSE THE CANDLE
THREW A VERY BAD LIGHT MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO GET A BETTER ONE THE
LAMP WAS ON THE TABLE SO I LIT IT
AND BLEW OUT THE CANDLE
EXACTLY
HOLMES ASKED NO FURTHER QUESTION AND BARKER WITH A DELIBERATE LOOK
FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US WHICH HAD AS IT SEEMED TO ME SOMETHING
OF DEFIANCE IN IT TURNED AND LEFT THE ROOM
INSPECTOR MACDONALD HAD SENT UP A NOTE TO THE EFFECT THAT HE WOULD
WAIT UPON MRS DOUGLAS IN HER ROOM BUT SHE HAD REPLIED THAT SHE
WOULD MEET US IN THE DINING ROOM SHE ENTERED NOW A TALL AND
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN OF THIRTY RESERVED AND SELFPOSSESSED TO A
REMARKABLE DEGREE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE TRAGIC AND DISTRACTED
FIGURE I HAD PICTURED IT IS TRUE THAT HER FACE WAS PALE AND DRAWN
LIKE THAT OF ONE WHO HAS ENDURED A GREAT SHOCK BUT HER MANNER WAS
COMPOSED AND THE FINELY MOULDED HAND WHICH SHE RESTED UPON THE EDGE
OF THE TABLE WAS AS STEADY AS MY OWN HER SAD APPEALING EYES
TRAVELLED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US WITH A CURIOUSLY INQUISITIVE
EXPRESSION THAT QUESTIONING GAZE TRANSFORMED ITSELF SUDDENLY INTO
ABRUPT SPEECH
HAVE YOU FOUND ANYTHING OUT YET SHE ASKED
WAS IT MY IMAGINATION THAT THERE WAS AN UNDERTONE OF FEAR RATHER THAN
OF HOPE IN THE QUESTION
WE HAVE TAKEN EVERY POSSIBLE STEP MRS DOUGLAS SAID THE
INSPECTOR YOU MAY REST ASSURED THAT NOTHING WILL BE NEGLECTED
SPARE NO MONEY SHE SAID IN A DEAD EVEN TONE IT IS MY DESIRE
THAT EVERY POSSIBLE EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE
PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL US SOMETHING WHICH MAY THROW SOME LIGHT UPON
THE MATTER
I FEAR NOT BUT ALL I KNOW IS AT YOUR SERVICE
WE HAVE HEARD FROM MR CECIL BARKER THAT YOU DID NOT ACTUALLY
SEETHAT YOU WERE NEVER IN THE ROOM WHERE THE TRAGEDY OCCURRED
NO HE TURNED ME BACK UPON THE STAIRS HE BEGGED ME TO RETURN TO MY
ROOM
QUITE SO YOU HAD HEARD THE SHOT AND YOU HAD AT ONCE COME DOWN
I PUT ON MY DRESSING GOWN AND THEN CAME DOWN
HOW LONG WAS IT AFTER HEARING THE SHOT THAT YOU WERE STOPPED ON THE
STAIR BY MR BARKER
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF MINUTES IT IS SO HARD TO RECKON TIME
AT SUCH A MOMENT HE IMPLORED ME NOT TO GO ON HE ASSURED ME THAT I
COULD DO NOTHING THEN MRS ALLEN THE HOUSEKEEPER LED ME UPSTAIRS
AGAIN IT WAS ALL LIKE SOME DREADFUL DREAM
CAN YOU GIVE US ANY IDEA HOW LONG YOUR HUSBAND HAD BEEN DOWNSTAIRS
BEFORE YOU HEARD THE SHOT
NO I CANNOT SAY HE WENT FROM HIS DRESSING ROOM AND I DID NOT HEAR
HIM GO HE DID THE ROUND OF THE HOUSE EVERY NIGHT FOR HE WAS NERVOUS
OF FIRE IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE EVER KNOWN HIM NERVOUS OF
THAT IS JUST THE POINT WHICH I WANT TO COME TO MRS DOUGLAS YOU
HAVE KNOWN YOUR HUSBAND ONLY IN ENGLAND HAVE YOU NOT
YES WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED FIVE YEARS
HAVE YOU HEARD HIM SPEAK OF ANYTHING WHICH OCCURRED IN AMERICA AND
MIGHT BRING SOME DANGER UPON HIM
MRS DOUGLAS THOUGHT EARNESTLY BEFORE SHE ANSWERED YES SHE SAID
AT LAST I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THERE WAS A DANGER HANGING OVER
HIM HE REFUSED TO DISCUSS IT WITH ME IT WAS NOT FROM WANT OF
CONFIDENCE IN METHERE WAS THE MOST COMPLETE LOVE AND CONFIDENCE
BETWEEN USBUT IT WAS OUT OF HIS DESIRE TO KEEP ALL ALARM AWAY FROM
ME HE THOUGHT I SHOULD BROOD OVER IT IF I KNEW ALL AND SO HE WAS
SILENT
HOW DID YOU KNOW IT THEN
MRS DOUGLASS FACE LIT WITH A QUICK SMILE CAN A HUSBAND EVER CARRY
ABOUT A SECRET ALL HIS LIFE AND A WOMAN WHO LOVES HIM HAVE NO
SUSPICION OF IT I KNEW IT BY HIS REFUSAL TO TALK ABOUT SOME EPISODES
IN HIS AMERICAN LIFE I KNEW IT BY CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS HE TOOK I
KNEW IT BY CERTAIN WORDS HE LET FALL I KNEW IT BY THE WAY HE LOOKED
AT UNEXPECTED STRANGERS I WAS PERFECTLY CERTAIN THAT HE HAD SOME
POWERFUL ENEMIES THAT HE BELIEVED THEY WERE ON HIS TRACK AND THAT
HE WAS ALWAYS ON HIS GUARD AGAINST THEM I WAS SO SURE OF IT THAT FOR
YEARS I HAVE BEEN TERRIFIED IF EVER HE CAME HOME LATER THAN WAS
EXPECTED
MIGHT I ASK ASKED HOLMES WHAT THE WORDS WERE WHICH ATTRACTED
YOUR ATTENTION
THE VALLEY OF FEAR THE LADY ANSWERED THAT WAS AN EXPRESSION HE
HAS USED WHEN I QUESTIONED HIM I HAVE BEEN IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR I
AM NOT OUT OF IT YETARE WE NEVER TO GET OUT OF THE VALLEY OF
FEAR I HAVE ASKED HIM WHEN I HAVE SEEN HIM MORE SERIOUS THAN USUAL
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT WE NEVER SHALL HE HAS ANSWERED
SURELY YOU ASKED HIM WHAT HE MEANT BY THE VALLEY OF FEAR
I DID BUT HIS FACE WOULD BECOME VERY GRAVE AND HE WOULD SHAKE HIS
HEAD IT IS BAD ENOUGH THAT ONE OF US SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN ITS
SHADOW HE SAID PLEASE GOD IT SHALL NEVER FALL UPON YOU IT WAS
SOME REAL VALLEY IN WHICH HE HAD LIVED AND IN WHICH SOMETHING
TERRIBLE HAD OCCURRED TO HIM OF THAT I AM CERTAIN BUT I CAN TELL
YOU NO MORE
AND HE NEVER MENTIONED ANY NAMES
YES HE WAS DELIRIOUS WITH FEVER ONCE WHEN HE HAD HIS HUNTING
ACCIDENT THREE YEARS AGO THEN I REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS A NAME THAT
CAME CONTINUALLY TO HIS LIPS HE SPOKE IT WITH ANGER AND A SORT OF
HORROR MCGINTY WAS THE NAMEBODYMASTER MCGINTY I ASKED HIM WHEN HE
RECOVERED WHO BODYMASTER MCGINTY WAS AND WHOSE BODY HE WAS MASTER
OF NEVER OF MINE THANK GOD HE ANSWERED WITH A LAUGH AND THAT
WAS ALL I COULD GET FROM HIM BUT THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN
BODYMASTER MCGINTY AND THE VALLEY OF FEAR
THERE IS ONE OTHER POINT SAID INSPECTOR MACDONALD YOU MET MR
DOUGLAS IN A BOARDING HOUSE IN LONDON DID YOU NOT AND BECAME
ENGAGED TO HIM THERE WAS THERE ANY ROMANCE ANYTHING SECRET OR
MYSTERIOUS ABOUT THE WEDDING
THERE WAS ROMANCE THERE IS ALWAYS ROMANCE THERE WAS NOTHING
MYSTERIOUS
HE HAD NO RIVAL
NO I WAS QUITE FREE
YOU HAVE HEARD NO DOUBT THAT HIS WEDDING RING HAS BEEN TAKEN DOES
THAT SUGGEST ANYTHING TO YOU SUPPOSE THAT SOME ENEMY OF HIS OLD LIFE
HAD TRACKED HIM DOWN AND COMMITTED THIS CRIME WHAT POSSIBLE REASON
COULD HE HAVE FOR TAKING HIS WEDDING RING
FOR AN INSTANT I COULD HAVE SWORN THAT THE FAINTEST SHADOW OF A SMILE
FLICKERED OVER THE WOMANS LIPS
I REALLY CANNOT TELL SHE ANSWERED IT IS CERTAINLY A MOST
EXTRAORDINARY THING
WELL WE WILL NOT DETAIN YOU ANY LONGER AND WE ARE SORRY TO HAVE
PUT YOU TO THIS TROUBLE AT SUCH A TIME SAID THE INSPECTOR THERE
ARE SOME OTHER POINTS NO DOUBT BUT WE CAN REFER TO YOU AS THEY
ARISE
SHE ROSE AND I WAS AGAIN CONSCIOUS OF THAT QUICK QUESTIONING GLANCE
WITH WHICH SHE HAD JUST SURVEYED US WHAT IMPRESSION HAS MY EVIDENCE
MADE UPON YOU THE QUESTION MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN SPOKEN THEN
WITH A BOW SHE SWEPT FROM THE ROOM
SHES A BEAUTIFUL WOMANA VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SAID MACDONALD
THOUGHTFULLY AFTER THE DOOR HAD CLOSED BEHIND HER THIS MAN BARKER
HAS CERTAINLY BEEN DOWN HERE A GOOD DEAL HE IS A MAN WHO MIGHT BE
ATTRACTIVE TO A WOMAN HE ADMITS THAT THE DEAD MAN WAS JEALOUS AND
MAYBE HE KNEW BEST HIMSELF WHAT CAUSE HE HAD FOR JEALOUSY THEN
THERES THAT WEDDING RING YOU CANT GET PAST THAT THE MAN WHO TEARS
A WEDDING RING OFF A DEAD MANSWHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT MR HOLMES
MY FRIEND HAD SAT WITH HIS HEAD UPON HIS HANDS SUNK IN THE DEEPEST
THOUGHT NOW HE ROSE AND RANG THE BELL AMES HE SAID WHEN THE
BUTLER ENTERED WHERE IS MR CECIL BARKER NOW
ILL SEE SIR
HE CAME BACK IN A MOMENT TO SAY THAT BARKER WAS IN THE GARDEN
CAN YOU REMEMBER AMES WHAT MR BARKER HAD ON HIS FEET LAST NIGHT
WHEN YOU JOINED HIM IN THE STUDY
YES MR HOLMES HE HAD A PAIR OF BEDROOM SLIPPERS I BROUGHT HIM
HIS BOOTS WHEN HE WENT FOR THE POLICE
WHERE ARE THE SLIPPERS NOW
THEY ARE STILL UNDER THE CHAIR IN THE HALL
VERY GOOD AMES IT IS OF COURSE IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW WHICH
TRACKS MAY BE MR BARKERS AND WHICH FROM OUTSIDE
YES SIR I MAY SAY THAT I NOTICED THAT THE SLIPPERS WERE STAINED
WITH BLOODSO INDEED WERE MY OWN
THAT IS NATURAL ENOUGH CONSIDERING THE CONDITION OF THE ROOM VERY
GOOD AMES WE WILL RING IF WE WANT YOU
A FEW MINUTES LATER WE WERE IN THE STUDY HOLMES HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM
THE CARPET SLIPPERS FROM THE HALL AS AMES HAD OBSERVED THE SOLES OF
BOTH WERE DARK WITH BLOOD
STRANGE MURMURED HOLMES AS HE STOOD IN THE LIGHT OF THE WINDOW
AND EXAMINED THEM MINUTELY VERY STRANGE INDEED
STOOPING WITH ONE OF HIS QUICK FELINE POUNCES HE PLACED THE SLIPPER
UPON THE BLOOD MARK ON THE SILL IT EXACTLY CORRESPONDED HE SMILED
IN SILENCE AT HIS COLLEAGUES
THE INSPECTOR WAS TRANSFIGURED WITH EXCITEMENT HIS NATIVE ACCENT
RATTLED LIKE A STICK UPON RAILINGS
MAN HE CRIED THERES NOT A DOUBT OF IT BARKER HAS JUST MARKED
THE WINDOW HIMSELF ITS A GOOD DEAL BROADER THAN ANY BOOTMARK I
MIND THAT YOU SAID IT WAS A SPLAYFOOT AND HERES THE EXPLANATION
BUT WHATS THE GAME MR HOLMESWHATS THE GAME
AY WHATS THE GAME MY FRIEND REPEATED THOUGHTFULLY
WHITE MASON CHUCKLED AND RUBBED HIS FAT HANDS TOGETHER IN HIS
PROFESSIONAL SATISFACTION I SAID IT WAS A SNORTER HE CRIED AND
A REAL SNORTER IT IS
CHAPTER VI
A DAWNING LIGHT
THE THREE DETECTIVES HAD MANY MATTERS OF DETAIL INTO WHICH TO
INQUIRE SO I RETURNED ALONE TO OUR MODEST QUARTERS AT THE VILLAGE
INN BUT BEFORE DOING SO I TOOK A STROLL IN THE CURIOUS OLDWORLD
GARDEN WHICH FLANKED THE HOUSE ROWS OF VERY ANCIENT YEW TREES CUT
INTO STRANGE DESIGNS GIRDED IT ROUND INSIDE WAS A BEAUTIFUL STRETCH
OF LAWN WITH AN OLD SUNDIAL IN THE MIDDLE THE WHOLE EFFECT SO
SOOTHING AND RESTFUL THAT IT WAS WELCOME TO MY SOMEWHAT JANGLED
NERVES
IN THAT DEEPLY PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE ONE COULD FORGET OR REMEMBER ONLY
AS SOME FANTASTIC NIGHTMARE THAT DARKENED STUDY WITH THE SPRAWLING
BLOODSTAINED FIGURE ON THE FLOOR AND YET AS I STROLLED ROUND IT AND
TRIED TO STEEP MY SOUL IN ITS GENTLE BALM A STRANGE INCIDENT
OCCURRED WHICH BROUGHT ME BACK TO THE TRAGEDY AND LEFT A SINISTER
IMPRESSION IN MY MIND
I HAVE SAID THAT A DECORATION OF YEW TREES CIRCLED THE GARDEN AT THE
END FARTHEST FROM THE HOUSE THEY THICKENED INTO A CONTINUOUS HEDGE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS HEDGE CONCEALED FROM THE EYES OF ANYONE
APPROACHING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE THERE WAS A STONE SEAT
AS I APPROACHED THE SPOT I WAS AWARE OF VOICES SOME REMARK IN THE
DEEP TONES OF A MAN ANSWERED BY A LITTLE RIPPLE OF FEMININE
LAUGHTER
AN INSTANT LATER I HAD COME ROUND THE END OF THE HEDGE AND MY EYES
LIT UPON MRS DOUGLAS AND THE MAN BARKER BEFORE THEY WERE AWARE OF MY
PRESENCE HER APPEARANCE GAVE ME A SHOCK IN THE DININGROOM SHE HAD
BEEN DEMURE AND DISCREET NOW ALL PRETENSE OF GRIEF HAD PASSED AWAY
FROM HER HER EYES SHONE WITH THE JOY OF LIVING AND HER FACE STILL
QUIVERED WITH AMUSEMENT AT SOME REMARK OF HER COMPANION HE SAT
FORWARD HIS HANDS CLASPED AND HIS FOREARMS ON HIS KNEES WITH AN
ANSWERING SMILE UPON HIS BOLD HANDSOME FACE IN AN INSTANTBUT IT
WAS JUST ONE INSTANT TOO LATETHEY RESUMED THEIR SOLEMN MASKS AS MY
FIGURE CAME INTO VIEW A HURRIED WORD OR TWO PASSED BETWEEN THEM AND
THEN BARKER ROSE AND CAME TOWARDS ME
EXCUSE ME SIR SAID HE BUT AM I ADDRESSING DR WATSON
I BOWED WITH A COLDNESS WHICH SHOWED I DARE SAY VERY PLAINLY THE
IMPRESSION WHICH HAD BEEN PRODUCED UPON MY MIND
WE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS PROBABLY YOU AS YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES IS SO WELL KNOWN WOULD YOU MIND COMING OVER AND
SPEAKING TO MRS DOUGLAS FOR ONE INSTANT
I FOLLOWED HIM WITH A DOUR FACE VERY CLEARLY I COULD SEE IN MY
MINDS EYE THAT SHATTERED FIGURE ON THE FLOOR HERE WITHIN A FEW
HOURS OF THE TRAGEDY WERE HIS WIFE AND HIS NEAREST FRIEND LAUGHING
TOGETHER BEHIND A BUSH IN THE GARDEN WHICH HAD BEEN HIS I GREETED
THE LADY WITH RESERVE I HAD GRIEVED WITH HER GRIEF IN THE
DININGROOM NOW I MET HER APPEALING GAZE WITH AN UNRESPONSIVE EYE
I FEAR THAT YOU THINK ME CALLOUS AND HARDHEARTED SAID SHE
I SHRUGGED MY SHOULDERS IT IS NO BUSINESS OF MINE SAID I
PERHAPS SOME DAY YOU WILL DO ME JUSTICE IF YOU ONLY REALIZED
THERE IS NO NEED WHY DR WATSON SHOULD REALIZE SAID BARKER
QUICKLY AS HE HAS HIMSELF SAID IT IS NO POSSIBLE BUSINESS OF HIS
EXACTLY SAID I AND SO I WILL BEG LEAVE TO RESUME MY WALK
ONE MOMENT DR WATSON CRIED THE WOMAN IN A PLEADING VOICE THERE
IS ONE QUESTION WHICH YOU CAN ANSWER WITH MORE AUTHORITY THAN ANYONE
ELSE IN THE WORLD AND IT MAY MAKE A VERY GREAT DIFFERENCE TO ME YOU
KNOW MR HOLMES AND HIS RELATIONS WITH THE POLICE BETTER THAN ANYONE
ELSE CAN SUPPOSING THAT A MATTER WERE BROUGHT CONFIDENTIALLY TO HIS
KNOWLEDGE IS IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD PASS IT ON TO
THE DETECTIVES
YES THATS IT SAID BARKER EAGERLY IS HE ON HIS OWN OR IS HE
ENTIRELY IN WITH THEM
I REALLY DONT KNOW THAT I SHOULD BE JUSTIFIED IN DISCUSSING SUCH A
POINT
I BEGI IMPLORE THAT YOU WILL DR WATSON I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU
WILL BE HELPING USHELPING ME GREATLY IF YOU WILL GUIDE US ON THAT
POINT
THERE WAS SUCH A RING OF SINCERITY IN THE WOMANS VOICE THAT FOR THE
INSTANT I FORGOT ALL ABOUT HER LEVITY AND WAS MOVED ONLY TO DO HER
WILL
MR HOLMES IS AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR I SAID HE IS HIS OWN
MASTER AND WOULD ACT AS HIS OWN JUDGMENT DIRECTED AT THE SAME TIME
HE WOULD NATURALLY FEEL LOYALTY TOWARDS THE OFFICIALS WHO WERE
WORKING ON THE SAME CASE AND HE WOULD NOT CONCEAL FROM THEM ANYTHING
WHICH WOULD HELP THEM IN BRINGING A CRIMINAL TO JUSTICE BEYOND THIS
I CAN SAY NOTHING AND I WOULD REFER YOU TO MR HOLMES HIMSELF IF YOU
WANTED FULLER INFORMATION
SO SAYING I RAISED MY HAT AND WENT UPON MY WAY LEAVING THEM STILL
SEATED BEHIND THAT CONCEALING HEDGE I LOOKED BACK AS I ROUNDED THE
FAR END OF IT AND SAW THAT THEY WERE STILL TALKING VERY EARNESTLY
TOGETHER AND AS THEY WERE GAZING AFTER ME IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS
OUR INTERVIEW THAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THEIR DEBATE
I WISH NONE OF THEIR CONFIDENCES SAID HOLMES WHEN I REPORTED TO
HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED HE HAD SPENT THE WHOLE AFTERNOON AT THE MANOR
HOUSE IN CONSULTATION WITH HIS TWO COLLEAGUES AND RETURNED ABOUT
FIVE WITH A RAVENOUS APPETITE FOR A HIGH TEA WHICH I HAD ORDERED FOR
HIM NO CONFIDENCES WATSON FOR THEY ARE MIGHTY AWKWARD IF IT COMES
TO AN ARREST FOR CONSPIRACY AND MURDER
YOU THINK IT WILL COME TO THAT
HE WAS IN HIS MOST CHEERFUL AND DEBONAIR HUMOUR MY DEAR WATSON
WHEN I HAVE EXTERMINATED THAT FOURTH EGG I SHALL BE READY TO PUT YOU
IN TOUCH WITH THE WHOLE SITUATION I DONT SAY THAT WE HAVE FATHOMED
ITFAR FROM ITBUT WHEN WE HAVE TRACED THE MISSING DUMBBELL
THE DUMBBELL
DEAR ME WATSON IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU HAVE NOT PENETRATED THE
FACT THAT THE CASE HANGS UPON THE MISSING DUMBBELL WELL WELL YOU
NEED NOT BE DOWNCAST FOR BETWEEN OURSELVES I DONT THINK THAT EITHER
INSPECTOR MAC OR THE EXCELLENT LOCAL PRACTITIONER HAS GRASPED THE
OVERWHELMING IMPORTANCE OF THIS INCIDENT ONE DUMBBELL WATSON
CONSIDER AN ATHLETE WITH ONE DUMBBELL PICTURE TO YOURSELF THE
UNILATERAL DEVELOPMENT THE IMMINENT DANGER OF A SPINAL CURVATURE
SHOCKING WATSON SHOCKING
HE SAT WITH HIS MOUTH FULL OF TOAST AND HIS EYES SPARKLING WITH
MISCHIEF WATCHING MY INTELLECTUAL ENTANGLEMENT THE MERE SIGHT OF
HIS EXCELLENT APPETITE WAS AN ASSURANCE OF SUCCESS FOR I HAD VERY
CLEAR RECOLLECTIONS OF DAYS AND NIGHTS WITHOUT A THOUGHT OF FOOD
WHEN HIS BAFFLED MIND HAD CHAFED BEFORE SOME PROBLEM WHILE HIS THIN
EAGER FEATURES BECAME MORE ATTENUATED WITH THE ASCETICISM OF COMPLETE
MENTAL CONCENTRATION FINALLY HE LIT HIS PIPE AND SITTING IN THE
INGLENOOK OF THE OLD VILLAGE INN HE TALKED SLOWLY AND AT RANDOM ABOUT
HIS CASE RATHER AS ONE WHO THINKS ALOUD THAN AS ONE WHO MAKES A
CONSIDERED STATEMENT
A LIE WATSONA GREAT BIG THUMPING OBTRUSIVE UNCOMPROMISING
LIETHATS WHAT MEETS US ON THE THRESHOLD THERE IS OUR STARTING
POINT THE WHOLE STORY TOLD BY BARKER IS A LIE BUT BARKERS STORY IS
CORROBORATED BY MRS DOUGLAS THEREFORE SHE IS LYING ALSO THEY ARE
BOTH LYING AND IN A CONSPIRACY SO NOW WE HAVE THE CLEAR PROBLEM
WHY ARE THEY LYING AND WHAT IS THE TRUTH WHICH THEY ARE TRYING SO
HARD TO CONCEAL LET US TRY WATSON YOU AND I IF WE CAN GET BEHIND
THE LIE AND RECONSTRUCT THE TRUTH
HOW DO I KNOW THAT THEY ARE LYING BECAUSE IT IS A CLUMSY
FABRICATION WHICH SIMPLY COULD NOT BE TRUE CONSIDER ACCORDING TO
THE STORY GIVEN TO US THE ASSASSIN HAD LESS THAN A MINUTE AFTER THE
MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED TO TAKE THAT RING WHICH WAS UNDER ANOTHER
RING FROM THE DEAD MANS FINGER TO REPLACE THE OTHER RINGA THING
WHICH HE WOULD SURELY NEVER HAVE DONEAND TO PUT THAT SINGULAR CARD
BESIDE HIS VICTIM I SAY THAT THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE
YOU MAY ARGUEBUT I HAVE TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR YOUR JUDGMENT
WATSON TO THINK THAT YOU WILL DO SOTHAT THE RING MAY HAVE BEEN
TAKEN BEFORE THE MAN WAS KILLED THE FACT THAT THE CANDLE HAD BEEN
LIT ONLY A SHORT TIME SHOWS THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO LENGTHY INTERVIEW
WAS DOUGLAS FROM WHAT WE HEAR OF HIS FEARLESS CHARACTER A MAN WHO
WOULD BE LIKELY TO GIVE UP HIS WEDDING RING AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE OR
COULD WE CONCEIVE OF HIS GIVING IT UP AT ALL NO NO WATSON THE
ASSASSIN WAS ALONE WITH THE DEAD MAN FOR SOME TIME WITH THE LAMP LIT
OF THAT I HAVE NO DOUBT AT ALL
BUT THE GUNSHOT WAS APPARENTLY THE CAUSE OF DEATH THEREFORE THE
SHOT MUST HAVE BEEN FIRED SOME TIME EARLIER THAN WE ARE TOLD BUT
THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT SUCH A MATTER AS THAT WE ARE IN THE
PRESENCE THEREFORE OF A DELIBERATE CONSPIRACY UPON THE PART OF THE
TWO PEOPLE WHO HEARD THE GUNSHOTOF THE MAN BARKER AND OF THE WOMAN
DOUGLAS WHEN ON THE TOP OF THIS I AM ABLE TO SHOW THAT THE BLOOD
MARK ON THE WINDOWSILL WAS DELIBERATELY PLACED THERE BY BARKER IN
ORDER TO GIVE A FALSE CLUE TO THE POLICE YOU WILL ADMIT THAT THE
CASE GROWS DARK AGAINST HIM
NOW WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES AT WHAT HOUR THE MURDER ACTUALLY DID
OCCUR UP TO HALFPAST TEN THE SERVANTS WERE MOVING ABOUT THE HOUSE
SO IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT BEFORE THAT TIME AT A QUARTER TO ELEVEN THEY
HAD ALL GONE TO THEIR ROOMS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AMES WHO WAS IN
THE PANTRY I HAVE BEEN TRYING SOME EXPERIMENTS AFTER YOU LEFT US
THIS AFTERNOON AND I FIND THAT NO NOISE WHICH MACDONALD CAN MAKE IN
THE STUDY CAN PENETRATE TO ME IN THE PANTRY WHEN THE DOORS ARE ALL
SHUT
IT IS OTHERWISE HOWEVER FROM THE HOUSEKEEPERS ROOM IT IS NOT SO
FAR DOWN THE CORRIDOR AND FROM IT I COULD VAGUELY HEAR A VOICE WHEN
IT WAS VERY LOUDLY RAISED THE SOUND FROM A SHOTGUN IS TO SOME EXTENT
MUFFLED WHEN THE DISCHARGE IS AT VERY CLOSE RANGE AS IT UNDOUBTEDLY
WAS IN THIS INSTANCE IT WOULD NOT BE VERY LOUD AND YET IN THE
SILENCE OF THE NIGHT IT SHOULD HAVE EASILY PENETRATED TO MRS ALLENS
ROOM SHE IS AS SHE HAS TOLD US SOMEWHAT DEAF BUT NONE THE LESS
SHE MENTIONED IN HER EVIDENCE THAT SHE DID HEAR SOMETHING LIKE A DOOR
SLAMMING HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THE ALARM WAS GIVEN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE
THE ALARM WAS GIVEN WOULD BE A QUARTER TO ELEVEN I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT WHAT SHE HEARD WAS THE REPORT OF THE GUN AND THAT THIS WAS THE
REAL INSTANT OF THE MURDER
IF THIS IS SO WE HAVE NOW TO DETERMINE WHAT BARKER AND MRS
DOUGLAS PRESUMING THAT THEY ARE NOT THE ACTUAL MURDERERS COULD HAVE
BEEN DOING FROM QUARTER TO ELEVEN WHEN THE SOUND OF THE SHOT BROUGHT
THEM DOWN UNTIL QUARTER PAST ELEVEN WHEN THEY RANG THE BELL AND
SUMMONED THE SERVANTS WHAT WERE THEY DOING AND WHY DID THEY NOT
INSTANTLY GIVE THE ALARM THAT IS THE QUESTION WHICH FACES US AND
WHEN IT HAS BEEN ANSWERED WE SHALL SURELY HAVE GONE SOME WAY TO SOLVE
OUR PROBLEM
I AM CONVINCED MYSELF SAID I THAT THERE IS AN UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN THOSE TWO PEOPLE SHE MUST BE A HEARTLESS CREATURE TO SIT
LAUGHING AT SOME JEST WITHIN A FEW HOURS OF HER HUSBANDS MURDER
EXACTLY SHE DOES NOT SHINE AS A WIFE EVEN IN HER OWN ACCOUNT OF
WHAT OCCURRED I AM NOT A WHOLESOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND AS YOU
ARE AWARE WATSON BUT MY EXPERIENCE OF LIFE HAS TAUGHT ME THAT THERE
ARE FEW WIVES HAVING ANY REGARD FOR THEIR HUSBANDS WHO WOULD LET
ANY MANS SPOKEN WORD STAND BETWEEN THEM AND THAT HUSBANDS DEAD
BODY SHOULD I EVER MARRY WATSON I SHOULD HOPE TO INSPIRE MY WIFE
WITH SOME FEELING WHICH WOULD PREVENT HER FROM BEING WALKED OFF BY A
HOUSEKEEPER WHEN MY CORPSE WAS LYING WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF HER IT
WAS BADLY STAGEMANAGED FOR EVEN THE RAWEST INVESTIGATORS MUST BE
STRUCK BY THE ABSENCE OF THE USUAL FEMININE ULULATION IF THERE HAD
BEEN NOTHING ELSE THIS INCIDENT ALONE WOULD HAVE SUGGESTED A
PREARRANGED CONSPIRACY TO MY MIND
YOU THINK THEN DEFINITELY THAT BARKER AND MRS DOUGLAS ARE GUILTY
OF THE MURDER
THERE IS AN APPALLING DIRECTNESS ABOUT YOUR QUESTIONS WATSON SAID
HOLMES SHAKING HIS PIPE AT ME THEY COME AT ME LIKE BULLETS IF YOU
PUT IT THAT MRS DOUGLAS AND BARKER KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MURDER
AND ARE CONSPIRING TO CONCEAL IT THEN I CAN GIVE YOU A WHOLESOULED
ANSWER I AM SURE THEY DO BUT YOUR MORE DEADLY PROPOSITION IS NOT SO
CLEAR LET US FOR A MOMENT CONSIDER THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH STAND IN
THE WAY
WE WILL SUPPOSE THAT THIS COUPLE ARE UNITED BY THE BONDS OF A GUILTY
LOVE AND THAT THEY HAVE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF THE MAN WHO STANDS
BETWEEN THEM IT IS A LARGE SUPPOSITION FOR DISCREET INQUIRY AMONG
SERVANTS AND OTHERS HAS FAILED TO CORROBORATE IT IN ANY WAY ON THE
CONTRARY THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF EVIDENCE THAT THE DOUGLASES WERE
VERY ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER
THAT I AM SURE CANNOT HE TRUE SAID I THINKING OF THE BEAUTIFUL
SMILING FACE IN THE GARDEN
WELL AT LEAST THEY GAVE THAT IMPRESSION HOWEVER WE WILL SUPPOSE
THAT THEY ARE AN EXTRAORDINARILY ASTUTE COUPLE WHO DECEIVE EVERYONE
UPON THIS POINT AND CONSPIRE TO MURDER THE HUSBAND HE HAPPENS TO BE
A MAN OVER WHOSE HEAD SOME DANGER HANGS
WE HAVE ONLY THEIR WORD FOR THAT
HOLMES LOOKED THOUGHTFUL I SEE WATSON YOU ARE SKETCHING OUT A
THEORY BY WHICH EVERYTHING THEY SAY FROM THE BEGINNING IS FALSE
ACCORDING TO YOUR IDEA THERE WAS NEVER ANY HIDDEN MENACE OR SECRET
SOCIETY OR VALLEY OF FEAR OR BOSS MACSOMEBODY OR ANYTHING ELSE
WELL THAT IS A GOOD SWEEPING GENERALIZATION LET US SEE WHAT THAT
BRINGS US TO THEY INVENT THIS THEORY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CRIME THEY
THEN PLAY UP TO THE IDEA BY LEAVING THIS BICYCLE IN THE PARK AS PROOF
OF THE EXISTENCE OF SOME OUTSIDER THE STAIN ON THE WINDOWSILL
CONVEYS THE SAME IDEA SO DOES THE CARD ON THE BODY WHICH MIGHT HAVE
BEEN PREPARED IN THE HOUSE THAT ALL FITS INTO YOUR HYPOTHESIS
WATSON BUT NOW WE COME ON THE NASTY ANGULAR UNCOMPROMISING BITS
WHICH WONT SLIP INTO THEIR PLACES WHY A CUTOFF SHOTGUN OF ALL
WEAPONSAND AN AMERICAN ONE AT THAT HOW COULD THEY BE SO SURE THAT
THE SOUND OF IT WOULD NOT BRING SOMEONE ON TO THEM ITS A MERE
CHANCE AS IT IS THAT MRS ALLEN DID NOT START OUT TO INQUIRE FOR THE
SLAMMING DOOR WHY DID YOUR GUILTY COUPLE DO ALL THIS WATSON
I CONFESS THAT I CANT EXPLAIN IT
THEN AGAIN IF A WOMAN AND HER LOVER CONSPIRE TO MURDER A HUSBAND
ARE THEY GOING TO ADVERTISE THEIR GUILT BY OSTENTATIOUSLY REMOVING
HIS WEDDING RING AFTER HIS DEATH DOES THAT STRIKE YOU AS VERY
PROBABLE WATSON
NO IT DOES NOT
AND ONCE AGAIN IF THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING A BICYCLE CONCEALED
OUTSIDE HAD OCCURRED TO YOU WOULD IT REALLY HAVE SEEMED WORTH DOING
WHEN THE DULLEST DETECTIVE WOULD NATURALLY SAY THIS IS AN OBVIOUS
BLIND AS THE BICYCLE IS THE FIRST THING WHICH THE FUGITIVE NEEDED IN
ORDER TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
I CAN CONCEIVE OF NO EXPLANATION
AND YET THERE SHOULD BE NO COMBINATION OF EVENTS FOR WHICH THE WIT
OF MAN CANNOT CONCEIVE AN EXPLANATION SIMPLY AS A MENTAL EXERCISE
WITHOUT ANY ASSERTION THAT IT IS TRUE LET ME INDICATE A POSSIBLE
LINE OF THOUGHT IT IS I ADMIT MERE IMAGINATION BUT HOW OFTEN IS
IMAGINATION THE MOTHER OF TRUTH
WE WILL SUPPOSE THAT THERE WAS A GUILTY SECRET A REALLY SHAMEFUL
SECRET IN THE LIFE OF THIS MAN DOUGLAS THIS LEADS TO HIS MURDER BY
SOMEONE WHO IS WE WILL SUPPOSE AN AVENGER SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE
THIS AVENGER FOR SOME REASON WHICH I CONFESS I AM STILL AT A LOSS TO
EXPLAIN TOOK THE DEAD MANS WEDDING RING THE VENDETTA MIGHT
CONCEIVABLY DATE BACK TO THE MANS FIRST MARRIAGE AND THE RING BE
TAKEN FOR SOME SUCH REASON
BEFORE THIS AVENGER GOT AWAY BARKER AND THE WIFE HAD REACHED THE
ROOM THE ASSASSIN CONVINCED THEM THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO ARREST HIM
WOULD LEAD TO THE PUBLICATION OF SOME HIDEOUS SCANDAL THEY WERE
CONVERTED TO THIS IDEA AND PREFERRED TO LET HIM GO FOR THIS PURPOSE
THEY PROBABLY LOWERED THE BRIDGE WHICH CAN BE DONE QUITE
NOISELESSLY AND THEN RAISED IT AGAIN HE MADE HIS ESCAPE AND FOR
SOME REASON THOUGHT THAT HE COULD DO SO MORE SAFELY ON FOOT THAN ON
THE BICYCLE HE THEREFORE LEFT HIS MACHINE WHERE IT WOULD NOT BE
DISCOVERED UNTIL HE HAD GOT SAFELY AWAY SO FAR WE ARE WITHIN THE
BOUNDS OF POSSIBILITY ARE WE NOT
WELL IT IS POSSIBLE NO DOUBT SAID I WITH SOME RESERVE
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WATSON THAT WHATEVER OCCURRED IS CERTAINLY
SOMETHING VERY EXTRAORDINARY WELL NOW TO CONTINUE OUR
SUPPOSITITIOUS CASE THE COUPLENOT NECESSARILY A GUILTY
COUPLEREALIZE AFTER THE MURDERER IS GONE THAT THEY HAVE PLACED
THEMSELVES IN A POSITION IN WHICH IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO
PROVE THAT THEY DID NOT THEMSELVES EITHER DO THE DEED OR CONNIVE AT
IT THEY RAPIDLY AND RATHER CLUMSILY MET THE SITUATION THE MARK WAS
PUT BY BARKERS BLOODSTAINED SLIPPER UPON THE WINDOWSILL TO SUGGEST
HOW THE FUGITIVE GOT AWAY THEY OBVIOUSLY WERE THE TWO WHO MUST HAVE
HEARD THE SOUND OF THE GUN SO THEY GAVE THE ALARM EXACTLY AS THEY
WOULD HAVE DONE BUT A GOOD HALF HOUR AFTER THE EVENT
AND HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO PROVE ALL THIS
WELL IF THERE WERE AN OUTSIDER HE MAY BE TRACED AND TAKEN THAT
WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE OF ALL PROOFS BUT IF NOTWELL THE
RESOURCES OF SCIENCE ARE FAR FROM BEING EXHAUSTED I THINK THAT AN
EVENING ALONE IN THAT STUDY WOULD HELP ME MUCH
AN EVENING ALONE
I PROPOSE TO GO UP THERE PRESENTLY I HAVE ARRANGED IT WITH THE
ESTIMABLE AMES WHO IS BY NO MEANS WHOLEHEARTED ABOUT BARKER I
SHALL SIT IN THAT ROOM AND SEE IF ITS ATMOSPHERE BRINGS ME
INSPIRATION IM A BELIEVER IN THE GENIUS LOCI YOU SMILE FRIEND
WATSON WELL WE SHALL SEE BY THE WAY YOU HAVE THAT BIG UMBRELLA OF
YOURS HAVE YOU NOT
IT IS HERE
WELL ILL BORROW THAT IF I MAY
CERTAINLYBUT WHAT A WRETCHED WEAPON IF THERE IS DANGER
NOTHING SERIOUS MY DEAR WATSON OR I SHOULD CERTAINLY ASK FOR YOUR
ASSISTANCE BUT ILL TAKE THE UMBRELLA AT PRESENT I AM ONLY AWAITING
THE RETURN OF OUR COLLEAGUES FROM TUNBRIDGE WELLS WHERE THEY ARE AT
PRESENT ENGAGED IN TRYING FOR A LIKELY OWNER TO THE BICYCLE
IT WAS NIGHTFALL BEFORE INSPECTOR MACDONALD AND WHITE MASON CAME BACK
FROM THEIR EXPEDITION AND THEY ARRIVED EXULTANT REPORTING A GREAT
ADVANCE IN OUR INVESTIGATION
MAN ILL ADMEET THAT I HAD MY DOUBTS IF THERE WAS EVER AN
OUTSIDER SAID MACDONALD BUT THATS ALL PAST NOW WEVE HAD THE
BICYCLE IDENTIFIED AND WE HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF OUR MAN SO THATS A
LONG STEP ON OUR JOURNEY
IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE END SAID HOLMES IM
SURE I CONGRATULATE YOU BOTH WITH ALL MY HEART
WELL I STARTED FROM THE FACT THAT MR DOUGLAS HAD SEEMED DISTURBED
SINCE THE DAY BEFORE WHEN HE HAD BEEN AT TUNBRIDGE WELLS IT WAS AT
TUNBRIDGE WELLS THEN THAT HE HAD BECOME CONSCIOUS OF SOME DANGER IT
WAS CLEAR THEREFORE THAT IF A MAN HAD COME OVER WITH A BICYCLE IT
WAS FROM TUNBRIDGE WELLS THAT HE MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO HAVE COME WE
TOOK THE BICYCLE OVER WITH US AND SHOWED IT AT THE HOTELS IT WAS
IDENTIFIED AT ONCE BY THE MANAGER OF THE EAGLE COMMERCIAL AS
BELONGING TO A MAN NAMED HARGRAVE WHO HAD TAKEN A ROOM THERE TWO
DAYS BEFORE THIS BICYCLE AND A SMALL VALISE WERE HIS WHOLE
BELONGINGS HE HAD REGISTERED HIS NAME AS COMING FROM LONDON BUT HAD
GIVEN NO ADDRESS THE VALISE WAS LONDON MADE AND THE CONTENTS WERE
BRITISH BUT THE MAN HIMSELF WAS UNDOUBTEDLY AN AMERICAN
WELL WELL SAID HOLMES GLEEFULLY YOU HAVE INDEED DONE SOME SOLID
WORK WHILE I HAVE BEEN SITTING SPINNING THEORIES WITH MY FRIEND ITS
A LESSON IN BEING PRACTICAL MR MAC
AY ITS JUST THAT MR HOLMES SAID THE INSPECTOR WITH
SATISFACTION
BUT THIS MAY ALL FIT IN WITH YOUR THEORIES I REMARKED
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE BUT LET US HEAR THE END MR MAC WAS THERE
NOTHING TO IDENTIFY THIS MAN
SO LITTLE THAT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD CAREFULLY GUARDED HIMSELF
AGAINST IDENTIFICATION THERE WERE NO PAPERS OR LETTERS AND NO
MARKING UPON THE CLOTHES A CYCLE MAP OF THE COUNTY LAY ON HIS
BEDROOM TABLE HE HAD LEFT THE HOTEL AFTER BREAKFAST YESTERDAY
MORNING ON HIS BICYCLE AND NO MORE WAS HEARD OF HIM UNTIL OUR
INQUIRIES
THATS WHAT PUZZLES ME MR HOLMES SAID WHITE MASON IF THE
FELLOW DID NOT WANT THE HUE AND CRY RAISED OVER HIM ONE WOULD
IMAGINE THAT HE WOULD HAVE RETURNED AND REMAINED AT THE HOTEL AS AN
INOFFENSIVE TOURIST AS IT IS HE MUST KNOW THAT HE WILL BE REPORTED
TO THE POLICE BY THE HOTEL MANAGER AND THAT HIS DISAPPEARANCE WILL BE
CONNECTED WITH THE MURDER
SO ONE WOULD IMAGINE STILL HE HAS BEEN JUSTIFIED OF HIS WISDOM UP
TO DATE AT ANY RATE SINCE HE HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN BUT HIS
DESCRIPTIONWHAT OF THAT
MACDONALD REFERRED TO HIS NOTEBOOK HERE WE HAVE IT SO FAR AS THEY
COULD GIVE IT THEY DONT SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN ANY VERY PARTICULAR
STOCK OF HIM BUT STILL THE PORTER THE CLERK AND THE CHAMBERMAID
ARE ALL AGREED THAT THIS ABOUT COVERS THE POINTS HE WAS A MAN ABOUT
FIVE FOOT NINE IN HEIGHT FIFTY OR SO YEARS OF AGE HIS HAIR SLIGHTLY
GRIZZLED A GRAYISH MOUSTACHE A CURVED NOSE AND A FACE WHICH ALL OF
THEM DESCRIBED AS FIERCE AND FORBIDDING
WELL BAR THE EXPRESSION THAT MIGHT ALMOST BE A DESCRIPTION OF
DOUGLAS HIMSELF SAID HOLMES HE IS JUST OVER FIFTY WITH GRIZZLED
HAIR AND MOUSTACHE AND ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT DID YOU GET ANYTHING
ELSE
HE WAS DRESSED IN A HEAVY GRAY SUIT WITH A REEFER JACKET AND HE
WORE A SHORT YELLOW OVERCOAT AND A SOFT CAP
WHAT ABOUT THE SHOTGUN
IT IS LESS THAN TWO FEET LONG IT COULD VERY WELL HAVE FITTED INTO
HIS VALISE HE COULD HAVE CARRIED IT INSIDE HIS OVERCOAT WITHOUT
DIFFICULTY
AND HOW DO YOU CONSIDER THAT ALL THIS BEARS UPON THE GENERAL CASE
WELL MR HOLMES SAID MACDONALD WHEN WE HAVE GOT OUR MANAND
YOU MAY BE SURE THAT I HAD HIS DESCRIPTION ON THE WIRES WITHIN FIVE
MINUTES OF HEARING ITWE SHALL BE BETTER ABLE TO JUDGE BUT EVEN AS
IT STANDS WE HAVE SURELY GONE A LONG WAY WE KNOW THAT AN AMERICAN
CALLING HIMSELF HARGRAVE CAME TO TUNBRIDGE WELLS TWO DAYS AGO WITH
BICYCLE AND VALISE IN THE LATTER WAS A SAWEDOFF SHOTGUN SO HE CAME
WITH THE DELIBERATE PURPOSE OF CRIME YESTERDAY MORNING HE SET OFF
FOR THIS PLACE ON HIS BICYCLE WITH HIS GUN CONCEALED IN HIS
OVERCOAT NO ONE SAW HIM ARRIVE SO FAR AS WE CAN LEARN BUT HE NEED
NOT PASS THROUGH THE VILLAGE TO REACH THE PARK GATES AND THERE ARE
MANY CYCLISTS UPON THE ROAD PRESUMABLY HE AT ONCE CONCEALED HIS
CYCLE AMONG THE LAURELS WHERE IT WAS FOUND AND POSSIBLY LURKED THERE
HIMSELF WITH HIS EYE ON THE HOUSE WAITING FOR MR DOUGLAS TO COME
OUT THE SHOTGUN IS A STRANGE WEAPON TO USE INSIDE A HOUSE BUT HE
HAD INTENDED TO USE IT OUTSIDE AND THERE IT HAS VERY OBVIOUS
ADVANTAGES AS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS WITH IT AND THE SOUND
OF SHOTS IS SO COMMON IN AN ENGLISH SPORTING NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT NO
PARTICULAR NOTICE WOULD BE TAKEN
THAT IS ALL VERY CLEAR SAID HOLMES
WELL MR DOUGLAS DID NOT APPEAR WHAT WAS HE TO DO NEXT HE LEFT
HIS BICYCLE AND APPROACHED THE HOUSE IN THE TWILIGHT HE FOUND THE
BRIDGE DOWN AND NO ONE ABOUT HE TOOK HIS CHANCE INTENDING NO
DOUBT TO MAKE SOME EXCUSE IF HE MET ANYONE HE MET NO ONE HE
SLIPPED INTO THE FIRST ROOM THAT HE SAW AND CONCEALED HIMSELF BEHIND
THE CURTAIN THENCE HE COULD SEE THE DRAWBRIDGE GO UP AND HE KNEW
THAT HIS ONLY ESCAPE WAS THROUGH THE MOAT HE WAITED UNTIL
QUARTERPAST ELEVEN WHEN MR DOUGLAS UPON HIS USUAL NIGHTLY ROUND
CAME INTO THE ROOM HE SHOT HIM AND ESCAPED AS ARRANGED HE WAS
AWARE THAT THE BICYCLE WOULD BE DESCRIBED BY THE HOTEL PEOPLE AND BE
A CLUE AGAINST HIM SO HE LEFT IT THERE AND MADE HIS WAY BY SOME
OTHER MEANS TO LONDON OR TO SOME SAFE HIDING PLACE WHICH HE HAD
ALREADY ARRANGED HOW IS THAT MR HOLMES
WELL MR MAC IT IS VERY GOOD AND VERY CLEAR SO FAR AS IT GOES
THAT IS YOUR END OF THE STORY MY END IS THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED
HALF AN HOUR EARLIER THAN REPORTED THAT MRS DOUGLAS AND BARKER ARE
BOTH IN A CONSPIRACY TO CONCEAL SOMETHING THAT THEY AIDED THE
MURDERERS ESCAPEOR AT LEAST THAT THEY REACHED THE ROOM BEFORE HE
ESCAPEDAND THAT THEY FABRICATED EVIDENCE OF HIS ESCAPE THROUGH THE
WINDOW WHEREAS IN ALL PROBABILITY THEY HAD THEMSELVES LET HIM GO BY
LOWERING THE BRIDGE THATS MY READING OF THE FIRST HALF
THE TWO DETECTIVES SHOOK THEIR HEADS
WELL MR HOLMES IF THIS IS TRUE WE ONLY TUMBLE OUT OF ONE MYSTERY
INTO ANOTHER SAID THE LONDON INSPECTOR
AND IN SOME WAYS A WORSE ONE ADDED WHITE MASON THE LADY HAS
NEVER BEEN IN AMERICA IN ALL HER LIFE WHAT POSSIBLE CONNECTION COULD
SHE HAVE WITH AN AMERICAN ASSASSIN WHICH WOULD CAUSE HER TO SHELTER
HIM
I FREELY ADMIT THE DIFFICULTIES SAID HOLMES I PROPOSE TO MAKE A
LITTLE INVESTIGATION OF MY OWN TONIGHT AND IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT
IT MAY CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING TO THE COMMON CAUSE
CAN WE HELP YOU MR HOLMES
NO NO DARKNESS AND DR WATSONS UMBRELLAMY WANTS ARE SIMPLE AND
AMES THE FAITHFUL AMES NO DOUBT HE WILL STRETCH A POINT FOR ME ALL
MY LINES OF THOUGHT LEAD ME BACK INVARIABLY TO THE ONE BASIC
QUESTIONWHY SHOULD AN ATHLETIC MAN DEVELOP HIS FRAME UPON SO
UNNATURAL AN INSTRUMENT AS A SINGLE DUMBBELL
IT WAS LATE THAT NIGHT WHEN HOLMES RETURNED FROM HIS SOLITARY
EXCURSION WE SLEPT IN A DOUBLEBEDDED ROOM WHICH WAS THE BEST THAT
THE LITTLE COUNTRY INN COULD DO FOR US I WAS ALREADY ASLEEP WHEN I
WAS PARTLY AWAKENED BY HIS ENTRANCE
WELL HOLMES I MURMURED HAVE YOU FOUND ANYTHING OUT
HE STOOD BESIDE ME IN SILENCE HIS CANDLE IN HIS HAND THEN THE TALL
LEAN FIGURE INCLINED TOWARDS ME I SAY WATSON HE WHISPERED
WOULD YOU BE AFRAID TO SLEEP IN THE SAME ROOM WITH A LUNATIC A MAN
WITH SOFTENING OF THE BRAIN AN IDIOT WHOSE MIND HAS LOST ITS GRIP
NOT IN THE LEAST I ANSWERED IN ASTONISHMENT
AH THATS LUCKY HE SAID AND NOT ANOTHER WORD WOULD HE UTTER THAT
NIGHT
CHAPTER VII
THE SOLUTION
NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST WE FOUND INSPECTOR MACDONALD AND WHITE
MASON SEATED IN CLOSE CONSULTATION IN THE SMALL PARLOUR OF THE LOCAL
POLICE SERGEANT ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF THEM WERE PILED A NUMBER OF
LETTERS AND TELEGRAMS WHICH THEY WERE CAREFULLY SORTING AND
DOCKETING THREE HAD BEEN PLACED ON ONE SIDE
STILL ON THE TRACK OF THE ELUSIVE BICYCLIST HOLMES ASKED
CHEERFULLY WHAT IS THE LATEST NEWS OF THE RUFFIAN
MACDONALD POINTED RUEFULLY TO HIS HEAP OF CORRESPONDENCE
HE IS AT PRESENT REPORTED FROM LEICESTER NOTTINGHAM SOUTHAMPTON
DERBY EAST HAM RICHMOND AND FOURTEEN OTHER PLACES IN THREE OF
THEMEAST HAM LEICESTER AND LIVERPOOLTHERE IS A CLEAR CASE
AGAINST HIM AND HE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ARRESTED THE COUNTRY SEEMS TO
BE FULL OF THE FUGITIVES WITH YELLOW COATS
DEAR ME SAID HOLMES SYMPATHETICALLY NOW MR MAC AND YOU MR
WHITE MASON I WISH TO GIVE YOU A VERY EARNEST PIECE OF ADVICE WHEN
I WENT INTO THIS CASE WITH YOU I BARGAINED AS YOU WILL NO DOUBT
REMEMBER THAT I SHOULD NOT PRESENT YOU WITH HALFPROVED THEORIES
BUT THAT I SHOULD RETAIN AND WORK OUT MY OWN IDEAS UNTIL I HAD
SATISFIED MYSELF THAT THEY WERE CORRECT FOR THIS REASON I AM NOT AT
THE PRESENT MOMENT TELLING YOU ALL THAT IS IN MY MIND ON THE OTHER
HAND I SAID THAT I WOULD PLAY THE GAME FAIRLY BY YOU AND I DO NOT
THINK IT IS A FAIR GAME TO ALLOW YOU FOR ONE UNNECESSARY MOMENT TO
WASTE YOUR ENERGIES UPON A PROFITLESS TASK THEREFORE I AM HERE TO
ADVISE YOU THIS MORNING AND MY ADVICE TO YOU IS SUMMED UP IN THREE
WORDSABANDON THE CASE
MACDONALD AND WHITE MASON STARED IN AMAZEMENT AT THEIR CELEBRATED
COLLEAGUE
YOU CONSIDER IT HOPELESS CRIED THE INSPECTOR
I CONSIDER YOUR CASE TO BE HOPELESS I DO NOT CONSIDER THAT IT IS
HOPELESS TO ARRIVE AT THE TRUTH
BUT THIS CYCLIST HE IS NOT AN INVENTION WE HAVE HIS DESCRIPTION
HIS VALISE HIS BICYCLE THE FELLOW MUST BE SOMEWHERE WHY SHOULD WE
NOT GET HIM
YES YES NO DOUBT HE IS SOMEWHERE AND NO DOUBT WE SHALL GET HIM
BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU WASTE YOUR ENERGIES IN EAST HAM OR
LIVERPOOL I AM SURE THAT WE CAN FIND SOME SHORTER CUT TO A RESULT
YOU ARE HOLDING SOMETHING BACK ITS HARDLY FAIR OF YOU MR
HOLMES THE INSPECTOR WAS ANNOYED
YOU KNOW MY METHODS OF WORK MR MAC BUT I WILL HOLD IT BACK FOR
THE SHORTEST TIME POSSIBLE I ONLY WISH TO VERIFY MY DETAILS IN ONE
WAY WHICH CAN VERY READILY BE DONE AND THEN I MAKE MY BOW AND
RETURN TO LONDON LEAVING MY RESULTS ENTIRELY AT YOUR SERVICE I OWE
YOU TOO MUCH TO ACT OTHERWISE FOR IN ALL MY EXPERIENCE I CANNOT
RECALL ANY MORE SINGULAR AND INTERESTING STUDY
THIS IS CLEAN BEYOND ME MR HOLMES WE SAW YOU WHEN WE RETURNED
FROM TUNBRIDGE WELLS LAST NIGHT AND YOU WERE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT
WITH OUR RESULTS WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN TO GIVE YOU A
COMPLETELY NEW IDEA OF THE CASE
WELL SINCE YOU ASK ME I SPENT AS I TOLD YOU THAT I WOULD SOME
HOURS LAST NIGHT AT THE MANOR HOUSE
WELL WHAT HAPPENED
AH I CAN ONLY GIVE YOU A VERY GENERAL ANSWER TO THAT FOR THE
MOMENT BY THE WAY I HAVE BEEN READING A SHORT BUT CLEAR AND
INTERESTING ACCOUNT OF THE OLD BUILDING PURCHASABLE AT THE MODEST
SUM OF ONE PENNY FROM THE LOCAL TOBACCONIST
HERE HOLMES DREW A SMALL TRACT EMBELLISHED WITH A RUDE ENGRAVING OF
THE ANCIENT MANOR HOUSE FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET
IT IMMENSELY ADDS TO THE ZEST OF AN INVESTIGATION MY DEAR MR MAC
WHEN ONE IS IN CONSCIOUS SYMPATHY WITH THE HISTORICAL ATMOSPHERE OF
ONES SURROUNDINGS DONT LOOK SO IMPATIENT FOR I ASSURE YOU THAT
EVEN SO BALD AN ACCOUNT AS THIS RAISES SOME SORT OF PICTURE OF THE
PAST IN ONES MIND PERMIT ME TO GIVE YOU A SAMPLE ERECTED IN THE
FIFTH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF JAMES I AND STANDING UPON THE SITE OF A
MUCH OLDER BUILDING THE MANOR HOUSE OF BIRLSTONE PRESENTS ONE OF THE
FINEST SURVIVING EXAMPLES OF THE MOATED JACOBEAN RESIDENCE YOU ARE
MAKING FOOLS OF US MR HOLMES
TUT TUT MR MACTHE FIRST SIGN OF TEMPER I HAVE DETECTED IN YOU
WELL I WONT READ IT VERBATIM SINCE YOU FEEL SO STRONGLY UPON THE
SUBJECT BUT WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THERE IS SOME ACCOUNT OF THE TAKING
OF THE PLACE BY A PARLIAMENTARY COLONEL IN OF THE CONCEALMENT
OF CHARLES FOR SEVERAL DAYS IN THE COURSE OF THE CIVIL WAR AND
FINALLY OF A VISIT THERE BY THE SECOND GEORGE YOU WILL ADMIT THAT
THERE ARE VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS OF INTEREST CONNECTED WITH THIS
ANCIENT HOUSE
I DONT DOUBT IT MR HOLMES BUT THAT IS NO BUSINESS OF OURS
IS IT NOT IS IT NOT BREADTH OF VIEW MY DEAR MR MAC IS ONE OF
THE ESSENTIALS OF OUR PROFESSION THE INTERPLAY OF IDEAS AND THE
OBLIQUE USES OF KNOWLEDGE ARE OFTEN OF EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST YOU
WILL EXCUSE THESE REMARKS FROM ONE WHO THOUGH A MERE CONNOISSEUR OF
CRIME IS STILL RATHER OLDER AND PERHAPS MORE EXPERIENCED THAN
YOURSELF
IM THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT SAID THE DETECTIVE HEARTILY YOU GET
TO YOUR POINT I ADMIT BUT YOU HAVE SUCH A DEUCED ROUNDTHECORNER
WAY OF DOING IT
WELL WELL ILL DROP PAST HISTORY AND GET DOWN TO PRESENTDAY
FACTS I CALLED LAST NIGHT AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID AT THE MANOR
HOUSE I DID NOT SEE EITHER BARKER OR MRS DOUGLAS I SAW NO
NECESSITY TO DISTURB THEM BUT I WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THE LADY
WAS NOT VISIBLY PINING AND THAT SHE HAD PARTAKEN OF AN EXCELLENT
DINNER MY VISIT WAS SPECIALLY MADE TO THE GOOD MR AMES WITH WHOM I
EXCHANGED SOME AMIABILITIES WHICH CULMINATED IN HIS ALLOWING ME
WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ANYONE ELSE TO SIT ALONE FOR A TIME IN THE
STUDY
WHAT WITH THAT I EJACULATED
NO NO EVERYTHING IS NOW IN ORDER YOU GAVE PERMISSION FOR THAT
MR MAC AS I AM INFORMED THE ROOM WAS IN ITS NORMAL STATE AND IN
IT I PASSED AN INSTRUCTIVE QUARTER OF AN HOUR
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
WELL NOT TO MAKE A MYSTERY OF SO SIMPLE A MATTER I WAS LOOKING FOR
THE MISSING DUMBBELL IT HAS ALWAYS BULKED RATHER LARGE IN MY
ESTIMATE OF THE CASE I ENDED BY FINDING IT
WHERE
AH THERE WE COME TO THE EDGE OF THE UNEXPLORED LET ME GO A LITTLE
FURTHER A VERY LITTLE FURTHER AND I WILL PROMISE THAT YOU SHALL
SHARE EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW
WELL WERE BOUND TO TAKE YOU ON YOUR OWN TERMS SAID THE
INSPECTOR BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TELLING US TO ABANDON THE CASEWHY
IN THE NAME OF GOODNESS SHOULD WE ABANDON THE CASE
FOR THE SIMPLE REASON MY DEAR MR MAC THAT YOU HAVE NOT GOT THE
FIRST IDEA WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ARE INVESTIGATING
WE ARE INVESTIGATING THE MURDER OF MR JOHN DOUGLAS OF BIRLSTONE
MANOR
YES YES SO YOU ARE BUT DONT TROUBLE TO TRACE THE MYSTERIOUS
GENTLEMAN UPON THE BICYCLE I ASSURE YOU THAT IT WONT HELP YOU
THEN WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST THAT WE DO
I WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT TO DO IF YOU WILL DO IT
WELL IM BOUND TO SAY IVE ALWAYS FOUND YOU HAD REASON BEHIND ALL
YOUR QUEER WAYS ILL DO WHAT YOU ADVISE
AND YOU MR WHITE MASON
THE COUNTRY DETECTIVE LOOKED HELPLESSLY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER HOLMES
AND HIS METHODS WERE NEW TO HIM WELL IF IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE
INSPECTOR IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME HE SAID AT LAST
CAPITAL SAID HOLMES WELL THEN I SHOULD RECOMMEND A NICE
CHEERY COUNTRY WALK FOR BOTH OF YOU THEY TELL ME THAT THE VIEWS FROM
BIRLSTONE RIDGE OVER THE WEALD ARE VERY REMARKABLE NO DOUBT LUNCH
COULD BE GOT AT SOME SUITABLE HOSTELRY THOUGH MY IGNORANCE OF THE
COUNTRY PREVENTS ME FROM RECOMMENDING ONE IN THE EVENING TIRED BUT
HAPPY
MAN THIS IS GETTING PAST A JOKE CRIED MACDONALD RISING ANGRILY
FROM HIS CHAIR
WELL WELL SPEND THE DAY AS YOU LIKE SAID HOLMES PATTING HIM
CHEERFULLY UPON THE SHOULDER DO WHAT YOU LIKE AND GO WHERE YOU
WILL BUT MEET ME HERE BEFORE DUSK WITHOUT FAILWITHOUT FAIL MR
MAC
THAT SOUNDS MORE LIKE SANITY
ALL OF IT WAS EXCELLENT ADVICE BUT I DONT INSIST SO LONG AS YOU
ARE HERE WHEN I NEED YOU BUT NOW BEFORE WE PART I WANT YOU TO
WRITE A NOTE TO MR BARKER
WELL
ILL DICTATE IT IF YOU LIKE READY
DEAR SIR
IT HAS STRUCK ME THAT IT IS OUR DUTY TO DRAIN THE MOAT IN THE HOPE
THAT WE MAY FIND SOME
ITS IMPOSSIBLE SAID THE INSPECTOR IVE MADE INQUIRY
TUT TUT MY DEAR SIR PLEASE DO WHAT I ASK YOU
WELL GO ON
IN THE HOPE THAT WE MAY FIND SOMETHING WHICH MAY BEAR UPON OUR
INVESTIGATION I HAVE MADE ARRANGEMENTS AND THE WORKMEN WILL BE AT
WORK EARLY TOMORROW MORNING DIVERTING THE STREAM
IMPOSSIBLE
DIVERTING THE STREAM SO I THOUGHT IT BEST TO EXPLAIN MATTERS
BEFOREHAND
NOW SIGN THAT AND SEND IT BY HAND ABOUT FOUR OCLOCK AT THAT HOUR
WE SHALL MEET AGAIN IN THIS ROOM UNTIL THEN WE MAY EACH DO WHAT WE
LIKE FOR I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS INQUIRY HAS COME TO A DEFINITE
PAUSE
EVENING WAS DRAWING IN WHEN WE REASSEMBLED HOLMES WAS VERY SERIOUS
IN HIS MANNER MYSELF CURIOUS AND THE DETECTIVES OBVIOUSLY CRITICAL
AND ANNOYED
WELL GENTLEMEN SAID MY FRIEND GRAVELY I AM ASKING YOU NOW TO
PUT EVERYTHING TO THE TEST WITH ME AND YOU WILL JUDGE FOR YOURSELVES
WHETHER THE OBSERVATIONS I HAVE MADE JUSTIFY THE CONCLUSIONS TO WHICH
I HAVE COME IT IS A CHILL EVENING AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG OUR
EXPEDITION MAY LAST SO I BEG THAT YOU WILL WEAR YOUR WARMEST COATS
IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE THAT WE SHOULD BE IN OUR PLACES BEFORE
IT GROWS DARK SO WITH YOUR PERMISSION WE SHALL GET STARTED AT ONCE
WE PASSED ALONG THE OUTER BOUNDS OF THE MANOR HOUSE PARK UNTIL WE
CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS A GAP IN THE RAILS WHICH FENCED IT
THROUGH THIS WE SLIPPED AND THEN IN THE GATHERING GLOOM WE FOLLOWED
HOLMES UNTIL WE HAD REACHED A SHRUBBERY WHICH LIES NEARLY OPPOSITE TO
THE MAIN DOOR AND THE DRAWBRIDGE THE LATTER HAD NOT BEEN RAISED
HOLMES CROUCHED DOWN BEHIND THE SCREEN OF LAURELS AND WE ALL THREE
FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE
WELL WHAT ARE WE TO DO NOW ASKED MACDONALD WITH SOME GRUFFNESS
POSSESS OUR SOULS IN PATIENCE AND MAKE AS LITTLE NOISE AS POSSIBLE
HOLMES ANSWERED
WHAT ARE WE HERE FOR AT ALL I REALLY THINK THAT YOU MIGHT TREAT US
WITH MORE FRANKNESS
HOLMES LAUGHED WATSON INSISTS THAT I AM THE DRAMATIST IN REAL
LIFE SAID HE SOME TOUCH OF THE ARTIST WELLS UP WITHIN ME AND
CALLS INSISTENTLY FOR A WELLSTAGED PERFORMANCE SURELY OUR
PROFESSION MR MAC WOULD BE A DRAB AND SORDID ONE IF WE DID NOT
SOMETIMES SET THE SCENE SO AS TO GLORIFY OUR RESULTS THE BLUNT
ACCUSATION THE BRUTAL TAP UPON THE SHOULDERWHAT CAN ONE MAKE OF
SUCH A DNOUEMENT BUT THE QUICK INFERENCE THE SUBTLE TRAP THE
CLEVER FORECAST OF COMING EVENTS THE TRIUMPHANT VINDICATION OF BOLD
THEORIESARE THESE NOT THE PRIDE AND THE JUSTIFICATION OF OUR LIFES
WORK AT THE PRESENT MOMENT YOU THRILL WITH THE GLAMOUR OF THE
SITUATION AND THE ANTICIPATION OF THE HUNT WHERE WOULD BE THAT
THRILL IF I HAD BEEN AS DEFINITE AS A TIMETABLE I ONLY ASK A LITTLE
PATIENCE MR MAC AND ALL WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU
WELL I HOPE THE PRIDE AND JUSTIFICATION AND THE REST OF IT WILL
COME BEFORE WE ALL GET OUR DEATH OF COLD SAID THE LONDON DETECTIVE
WITH COMIC RESIGNATION
WE ALL HAD GOOD REASON TO JOIN IN THE ASPIRATION FOR OUR VIGIL WAS A
LONG AND BITTER ONE SLOWLY THE SHADOWS DARKENED OVER THE LONG
SOMBRE FACE OF THE OLD HOUSE A COLD DAMP REEK FROM THE MOAT CHILLED
US TO THE BONES AND SET OUR TEETH CHATTERING THERE WAS A SINGLE LAMP
OVER THE GATEWAY AND A STEADY GLOBE OF LIGHT IN THE FATAL STUDY
EVERYTHING ELSE WAS DARK AND STILL
HOW LONG IS THIS TO LAST ASKED THE INSPECTOR FINALLY AND WHAT IS
IT WE ARE WATCHING FOR
I HAVE NO MORE NOTION THAN YOU HOW LONG IT IS TO LAST HOLMES
ANSWERED WITH SOME ASPERITY IF CRIMINALS WOULD ALWAYS SCHEDULE
THEIR MOVEMENTS LIKE RAILWAY TRAINS IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE MORE
CONVENIENT FOR ALL OF US AS TO WHAT IT IS WEWELL THATS WHAT WE
ARE WATCHING FOR
AS HE SPOKE THE BRIGHT YELLOW LIGHT IN THE STUDY WAS OBSCURED BY
SOMEBODY PASSING TO AND FRO BEFORE IT THE LAURELS AMONG WHICH WE LAY
WERE IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE THE WINDOW AND NOT MORE THAN A HUNDRED FEET
FROM IT PRESENTLY IT WAS THROWN OPEN WITH A WHINING OF HINGES AND
WE COULD DIMLY SEE THE DARK OUTLINE OF A MANS HEAD AND SHOULDERS
LOOKING OUT INTO THE GLOOM FOR SOME MINUTES HE PEERED FORTH IN
FURTIVE STEALTHY FASHION AS ONE WHO WISHES TO BE ASSURED THAT HE IS
UNOBSERVED THEN HE LEANED FORWARD AND IN THE INTENSE SILENCE WE
WERE AWARE OF THE SOFT LAPPING OF AGITATED WATER HE SEEMED TO BE
STIRRING UP THE MOAT WITH SOMETHING WHICH HE HELD IN HIS HAND THEN
SUDDENLY HE HAULED SOMETHING IN AS A FISHERMAN LANDS A FISHSOME
LARGE ROUND OBJECT WHICH OBSCURED THE LIGHT AS IT WAS DRAGGED
THROUGH THE OPEN CASEMENT
NOW CRIED HOLMES NOW
WE WERE ALL UPON OUR FEET STAGGERING AFTER HIM WITH OUR STIFFENED
LIMBS WHILE HE RAN SWIFTLY ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND RANG VIOLENTLY AT
THE BELL THERE WAS THE RASPING OF BOLTS FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND THE
AMAZED AMES STOOD IN THE ENTRANCE HOLMES BRUSHED HIM ASIDE WITHOUT A
WORD AND FOLLOWED BY ALL OF US RUSHED INTO THE ROOM WHICH HAD BEEN
OCCUPIED BY THE MAN WHOM WE HAD BEEN WATCHING
THE OIL LAMP ON THE TABLE REPRESENTED THE GLOW WHICH WE HAD SEEN FROM
OUTSIDE IT WAS NOW IN THE HAND OF CECIL BARKER WHO HELD IT TOWARDS
US AS WE ENTERED ITS LIGHT SHONE UPON HIS STRONG RESOLUTE
CLEANSHAVED FACE AND HIS MENACING EYES
WHAT THE DEVIL IS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS HE CRIED WHAT ARE YOU
AFTER ANYHOW
HOLMES TOOK A SWIFT GLANCE ROUND AND THEN POUNCED UPON A SODDEN
BUNDLE TIED TOGETHER WITH CORD WHICH LAY WHERE IT HAD BEEN THRUST
UNDER THE WRITING TABLE
THIS IS WHAT WE ARE AFTER MR BARKERTHIS BUNDLE WEIGHTED WITH A
DUMBBELL WHICH YOU HAVE JUST RAISED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE MOAT
BARKER STARED AT HOLMES WITH AMAZEMENT IN HIS FACE HOW IN THUNDER
CAME YOU TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT HE ASKED
SIMPLY THAT I PUT IT THERE
YOU PUT IT THERE YOU
PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE SAID REPLACED IT THERE SAID HOLMES YOU
WILL REMEMBER INSPECTOR MACDONALD THAT I WAS SOMEWHAT STRUCK BY THE
ABSENCE OF A DUMBBELL I DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO IT BUT WITH THE
PRESSURE OF OTHER EVENTS YOU HAD HARDLY THE TIME TO GIVE IT THE
CONSIDERATION WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED YOU TO DRAW DEDUCTIONS FROM
IT WHEN WATER IS NEAR AND A WEIGHT IS MISSING IT IS NOT A VERY
FARFETCHED SUPPOSITION THAT SOMETHING HAS BEEN SUNK IN THE WATER
THE IDEA WAS AT LEAST WORTH TESTING SO WITH THE HELP OF AMES WHO
ADMITTED ME TO THE ROOM AND THE CROOK OF DR WATSONS UMBRELLA I
WAS ABLE LAST NIGHT TO FISH UP AND INSPECT THIS BUNDLE
IT WAS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE HOWEVER THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO
PROVE WHO PLACED IT THERE THIS WE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE VERY OBVIOUS
DEVICE OF ANNOUNCING THAT THE MOAT WOULD BE DRIED TOMORROW WHICH
HAD OF COURSE THE EFFECT THAT WHOEVER HAD HIDDEN THE BUNDLE WOULD
MOST CERTAINLY WITHDRAW IT THE MOMENT THAT DARKNESS ENABLED HIM TO DO
SO WE HAVE NO LESS THAN FOUR WITNESSES AS TO WHO IT WAS WHO TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY AND SO MR BARKER I THINK THE WORD
LIES NOW WITH YOU
SHERLOCK HOLMES PUT THE SOPPING BUNDLE UPON THE TABLE BESIDE THE LAMP
AND UNDID THE CORD WHICH BOUND IT FROM WITHIN HE EXTRACTED A
DUMBBELL WHICH HE TOSSED DOWN TO ITS FELLOW IN THE CORNER NEXT HE
DREW FORTH A PAIR OF BOOTS AMERICAN AS YOU PERCEIVE HE REMARKED
POINTING TO THE TOES THEN HE LAID UPON THE TABLE A LONG DEADLY
SHEATHED KNIFE FINALLY HE UNRAVELLED A BUNDLE OF CLOTHING
COMPRISING A COMPLETE SET OF UNDERCLOTHES SOCKS A GRAY TWEED SUIT
AND A SHORT YELLOW OVERCOAT
THE CLOTHES ARE COMMONPLACE REMARKED HOLMES SAVE ONLY THE
OVERCOAT WHICH IS FULL OF SUGGESTIVE TOUCHES HE HELD IT TENDERLY
TOWARDS THE LIGHT HERE AS YOU PERCEIVE IS THE INNER POCKET
PROLONGED INTO THE LINING IN SUCH FASHION AS TO GIVE AMPLE SPACE FOR
THE TRUNCATED FOWLING PIECE THE TAILORS TAB IS ON THE NECKNEAL
OUTFITTER VERMISSA U S A I HAVE SPENT AN INSTRUCTIVE AFTERNOON
IN THE RECTORS LIBRARY AND HAVE ENLARGED MY KNOWLEDGE BY ADDING THE
FACT THAT VERMISSA IS A FLOURISHING LITTLE TOWN AT THE HEAD OF ONE OF
THE BEST KNOWN COAL AND IRON VALLEYS IN THE UNITED STATES I HAVE
SOME RECOLLECTION MR BARKER THAT YOU ASSOCIATED THE COAL DISTRICTS
WITH MR DOUGLASS FIRST WIFE AND IT WOULD SURELY NOT BE TOO
FARFETCHED AN INFERENCE THAT THE V V UPON THE CARD BY THE DEAD
BODY MIGHT STAND FOR VERMISSA VALLEY OR THAT THIS VERY VALLEY WHICH
SENDS FORTH EMISSARIES OF MURDER MAY BE THAT VALLEY OF FEAR OF WHICH
WE HAVE HEARD SO MUCH IS FAIRLY CLEAR AND NOW MR BARKER I SEEM
TO BE STANDING RATHER IN THE WAY OF YOUR EXPLANATION
IT WAS A SIGHT TO SEE CECIL BARKERS EXPRESSIVE FACE DURING THIS
EXPOSITION OF THE GREAT DETECTIVE ANGER AMAZEMENT CONSTERNATION
AND INDECISION SWEPT OVER IT IN TURN FINALLY HE TOOK REFUGE IN A
SOMEWHAT ACRID IRONY
YOU KNOW SUCH A LOT MR HOLMES PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER TELL US SOME
MORE HE SNEERED
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I COULD TELL YOU A GREAT DEAL MORE MR BARKER
BUT IT WOULD COME WITH A BETTER GRACE FROM YOU
OH YOU THINK SO DO YOU WELL ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IF THERES ANY
SECRET HERE IT IS NOT MY SECRET AND I AM NOT THE MAN TO GIVE IT
AWAY
WELL IF YOU TAKE THAT LINE MR BARKER SAID THE INSPECTOR
QUIETLY WE MUST JUST KEEP YOU IN SIGHT UNTIL WE HAVE THE WARRANT
AND CAN HOLD YOU
YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU DAMN PLEASE ABOUT THAT SAID BARKER DEFIANTLY
THE PROCEEDINGS SEEMED TO HAVE COME TO A DEFINITE END SO FAR AS HE
WAS CONCERNED FOR ONE HAD ONLY TO LOOK AT THAT GRANITE FACE TO
REALIZE THAT NO PEINE FORTE ET DURE WOULD EVER FORCE HIM TO PLEAD
AGAINST HIS WILL THE DEADLOCK WAS BROKEN HOWEVER BY A WOMANS
VOICE MRS DOUGLAS HAD BEEN STANDING LISTENING AT THE HALF OPENED
DOOR AND NOW SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH FOR NOW CECIL SAID SHE WHATEVER COMES OF
IT IN THE FUTURE YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH
ENOUGH AND MORE THAN ENOUGH REMARKED SHERLOCK HOLMES GRAVELY I
HAVE EVERY SYMPATHY WITH YOU MADAM AND SHOULD STRONGLY URGE YOU TO
HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE IN THE COMMON SENSE OF OUR JURISDICTION AND TO
TAKE THE POLICE VOLUNTARILY INTO YOUR COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IT MAY BE
THAT I AM MYSELF AT FAULT FOR NOT FOLLOWING UP THE HINT WHICH YOU
CONVEYED TO ME THROUGH MY FRIEND DR WATSON BUT AT THAT TIME I HAD
EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE DIRECTLY CONCERNED IN THE
CRIME NOW I AM ASSURED THAT THIS IS NOT SO AT THE SAME TIME THERE
IS MUCH THAT IS UNEXPLAINED AND I SHOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU
ASK MR DOUGLAS TO TELL US HIS OWN STORY
MRS DOUGLAS GAVE A CRY OF ASTONISHMENT AT HOLMESS WORDS THE
DETECTIVES AND I MUST HAVE ECHOED IT WHEN WE WERE AWARE OF A MAN WHO
SEEMED TO HAVE EMERGED FROM THE WALL WHO ADVANCED NOW FROM THE GLOOM
OF THE CORNER IN WHICH HE HAD APPEARED MRS DOUGLAS TURNED AND IN
AN INSTANT HER ARMS WERE ROUND HIM BARKER HAD SEIZED HIS
OUTSTRETCHED HAND
ITS BEST THIS WAY JACK HIS WIFE REPEATED I AM SURE THAT IT IS
BEST
INDEED YES MR DOUGLAS SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES I AM SURE THAT YOU
WILL FIND IT BEST
THE MAN STOOD BLINKING AT US WITH THE DAZED LOOK OF ONE WHO COMES
FROM THE DARK INTO THE LIGHT IT WAS A REMARKABLE FACE BOLD GRAY
EYES A STRONG SHORTCLIPPED GRIZZLED MOUSTACHE A SQUARE
PROJECTING CHIN AND A HUMOROUS MOUTH HE TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT US ALL
AND THEN TO MY AMAZEMENT HE ADVANCED TO ME AND HANDED ME A BUNDLE OF
PAPER
IVE HEARD OF YOU SAID HE IN A VOICE WHICH WAS NOT QUITE ENGLISH
AND NOT QUITE AMERICAN BUT WAS ALTOGETHER MELLOW AND PLEASING YOU
ARE THE HISTORIAN OF THIS BUNCH WELL DR WATSON YOUVE NEVER HAD
SUCH A STORY AS THAT PASS THROUGH YOUR HANDS BEFORE AND ILL LAY MY
LAST DOLLAR ON THAT TELL IT YOUR OWN WAY BUT THERE ARE THE FACTS
AND YOU CANT MISS THE PUBLIC SO LONG AS YOU HAVE THOSE IVE BEEN
COOPED UP TWO DAYS AND IVE SPENT THE DAYLIGHT HOURSAS MUCH
DAYLIGHT AS I COULD GET IN THAT RAT TRAPIN PUTTING THE THING INTO
WORDS YOURE WELCOME TO THEMYOU AND YOUR PUBLIC THERES THE STORY
OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR
THATS THE PAST MR DOUGLAS SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES QUIETLY WHAT
WE DESIRE NOW IS TO HEAR YOUR STORY OF THE PRESENT
YOULL HAVE IT SIR SAID DOUGLAS MAY I SMOKE AS I TALK WELL
THANK YOU MR HOLMES YOURE A SMOKER YOURSELF IF I REMEMBER RIGHT
AND YOULL GUESS WHAT IT IS TO BE SITTING FOR TWO DAYS WITH TOBACCO
IN YOUR POCKET AND AFRAID THAT THE SMELL WILL GIVE YOU AWAY HE
LEANED AGAINST THE MANTELPIECE AND SUCKED AT THE CIGAR WHICH HOLMES
HAD HANDED HIM IVE HEARD OF YOU MR HOLMES I NEVER GUESSED THAT
I SHOULD MEET YOU BUT BEFORE YOU ARE THROUGH WITH THAT HE NODDED
AT MY PAPERS YOU WILL SAY IVE BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING FRESH
INSPECTOR MACDONALD HAD BEEN STARING AT THE NEWCOMER WITH THE
GREATEST AMAZEMENT WELL THIS FAIRLY BEATS ME HE CRIED AT LAST
IF YOU ARE MR JOHN DOUGLAS OF BIRLSTONE MANOR THEN WHOSE DEATH
HAVE WE BEEN INVESTIGATING FOR THESE TWO DAYS AND WHERE IN THE WORLD
HAVE YOU SPRUNG FROM NOW YOU SEEMED TO ME TO COME OUT OF THE FLOOR
LIKE A JACKINABOX
AH MR MAC SAID HOLMES SHAKING A REPROVING FOREFINGER YOU
WOULD NOT READ THAT EXCELLENT LOCAL COMPILATION WHICH DESCRIBED THE
CONCEALMENT OF KING CHARLES PEOPLE DID NOT HIDE IN THOSE DAYS
WITHOUT EXCELLENT HIDING PLACES AND THE HIDING PLACE THAT HAS ONCE
BEEN USED MAY BE AGAIN I HAD PERSUADED MYSELF THAT WE SHOULD FIND
MR DOUGLAS UNDER THIS ROOF
AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN PLAYING THIS TRICK UPON US MR HOLMES
SAID THE INSPECTOR ANGRILY HOW LONG HAVE YOU ALLOWED US TO WASTE
OURSELVES UPON A SEARCH THAT YOU KNEW TO BE AN ABSURD ONE
NOT ONE INSTANT MY DEAR MR MAC ONLY LAST NIGHT DID I FORM MY
VIEWS OF THE CASE AS THEY COULD NOT BE PUT TO THE PROOF UNTIL THIS
EVENING I INVITED YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUE TO TAKE A HOLIDAY FOR THE
DAY PRAY WHAT MORE COULD I DO WHEN I FOUND THE SUIT OF CLOTHES IN
THE MOAT IT AT ONCE BECAME APPARENT TO ME THAT THE BODY WE HAD FOUND
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE BODY OF MR JOHN DOUGLAS AT ALL BUT MUST BE
THAT OF THE BICYCLIST FROM TUNBRIDGE WELLS NO OTHER CONCLUSION WAS
POSSIBLE THEREFORE I HAD TO DETERMINE WHERE MR JOHN DOUGLAS HIMSELF
COULD BE AND THE BALANCE OF PROBABILITY WAS THAT WITH THE CONNIVANCE
OF HIS WIFE AND HIS FRIEND HE WAS CONCEALED IN A HOUSE WHICH HAD SUCH
CONVENIENCES FOR A FUGITIVE AND AWAITING QUIETER TIMES WHEN HE COULD
MAKE HIS FINAL ESCAPE
WELL YOU FIGURED IT OUT ABOUT RIGHT SAID DOUGLAS APPROVINGLY I
THOUGHT ID DODGE YOUR BRITISH LAW FOR I WAS NOT SURE HOW I STOOD
UNDER IT AND ALSO I SAW MY CHANCE TO THROW THESE HOUNDS ONCE FOR ALL
OFF MY TRACK MIND YOU FROM FIRST TO LAST I HAVE DONE NOTHING TO BE
ASHAMED OF AND NOTHING THAT I WOULD NOT DO AGAIN BUT YOULL JUDGE
THAT FOR YOURSELVES WHEN I TELL YOU MY STORY NEVER MIND WARNING ME
INSPECTOR IM READY TO STAND PAT UPON THE TRUTH
IM NOT GOING TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING THATS ALL THERE HE
INDICATED MY BUNDLE OF PAPERS AND A MIGHTY QUEER YARN YOULL FIND
IT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS THAT THERE ARE SOME MEN THAT HAVE GOOD
CAUSE TO HATE ME AND WOULD GIVE THEIR LAST DOLLAR TO KNOW THAT THEY
HAD GOT ME SO LONG AS I AM ALIVE AND THEY ARE ALIVE THERE IS NO
SAFETY IN THIS WORLD FOR ME THEY HUNTED ME FROM CHICAGO TO
CALIFORNIA THEN THEY CHASED ME OUT OF AMERICA BUT WHEN I MARRIED
AND SETTLED DOWN IN THIS QUIET SPOT I THOUGHT MY LAST YEARS WERE
GOING TO BE PEACEABLE
I NEVER EXPLAINED TO MY WIFE HOW THINGS WERE WHY SHOULD I PULL HER
INTO IT SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE A QUIET MOMENT AGAIN BUT WOULD ALWAYS
BE IMAGINING TROUBLE I FANCY SHE KNEW SOMETHING FOR I MAY HAVE
DROPPED A WORD HERE OR A WORD THERE BUT UNTIL YESTERDAY AFTER YOU
GENTLEMEN HAD SEEN HER SHE NEVER KNEW THE RIGHTS OF THE MATTER SHE
TOLD YOU ALL SHE KNEW AND SO DID BARKER HERE FOR ON THE NIGHT WHEN
THIS THING HAPPENED THERE WAS MIGHTY LITTLE TIME FOR EXPLANATIONS
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING NOW AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN A WISER MAN IF I HAD
TOLD HER SOONER BUT IT WAS A HARD QUESTION DEAR HE TOOK HER HAND
FOR AN INSTANT IN HIS OWN AND I ACTED FOR THE BEST
WELL GENTLEMEN THE DAY BEFORE THESE HAPPENINGS I WAS OVER IN
TUNBRIDGE WELLS AND I GOT A GLIMPSE OF A MAN IN THE STREET IT WAS
ONLY A GLIMPSE BUT I HAVE A QUICK EYE FOR THESE THINGS AND I NEVER
DOUBTED WHO IT WAS IT WAS THE WORST ENEMY I HAD AMONG THEM ALLONE
WHO HAS BEEN AFTER ME LIKE A HUNGRY WOLF AFTER A CARIBOU ALL THESE
YEARS I KNEW THERE WAS TROUBLE COMING AND I CAME HOME AND MADE
READY FOR IT I GUESSED ID FIGHT THROUGH IT ALL RIGHT ON MY OWN MY
LUCK WAS A PROVERB IN THE STATES ABOUT I NEVER DOUBTED THAT IT
WOULD BE WITH ME STILL
I WAS ON MY GUARD ALL THAT NEXT DAY AND NEVER WENT OUT INTO THE
PARK ITS AS WELL OR HED HAVE HAD THE DROP ON ME WITH THAT
BUCKSHOT GUN OF HIS BEFORE EVER I COULD DRAW ON HIM AFTER THE BRIDGE
WAS UPMY MIND WAS ALWAYS MORE RESTFUL WHEN THAT BRIDGE WAS UP IN
THE EVENINGSI PUT THE THING CLEAR OUT OF MY HEAD I NEVER DREAMED
OF HIS GETTING INTO THE HOUSE AND WAITING FOR ME BUT WHEN I MADE MY
ROUND IN MY DRESSING GOWN AS WAS MY HABIT I HAD NO SOONER ENTERED
THE STUDY THAN I SCENTED DANGER I GUESS WHEN A MAN HAS HAD DANGERS
IN HIS LIFEAND IVE HAD MORE THAN MOST IN MY TIMETHERE IS A KIND
OF SIXTH SENSE THAT WAVES THE RED FLAG I SAW THE SIGNAL CLEAR
ENOUGH AND YET I COULDNT TELL YOU WHY NEXT INSTANT I SPOTTED A
BOOT UNDER THE WINDOW CURTAIN AND THEN I SAW WHY PLAIN ENOUGH
ID JUST THE ONE CANDLE THAT WAS IN MY HAND BUT THERE WAS A GOOD
LIGHT FROM THE HALL LAMP THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR I PUT DOWN THE CANDLE
AND JUMPED FOR A HAMMER THAT ID LEFT ON THE MANTEL AT THE SAME
MOMENT HE SPRANG AT ME I SAW THE GLINT OF A KNIFE AND I LASHED AT
HIM WITH THE HAMMER I GOT HIM SOMEWHERE FOR THE KNIFE TINKLED DOWN
ON THE FLOOR HE DODGED ROUND THE TABLE AS QUICK AS AN EEL AND A
MOMENT LATER HED GOT HIS GUN FROM UNDER HIS COAT I HEARD HIM COCK
IT BUT I HAD GOT HOLD OF IT BEFORE HE COULD FIRE I HAD IT BY THE
BARREL AND WE WRESTLED FOR IT ALL ENDS UP FOR A MINUTE OR MORE IT
WAS DEATH TO THE MAN THAT LOST HIS GRIP
HE NEVER LOST HIS GRIP BUT HE GOT IT BUTT DOWNWARD FOR A MOMENT TOO
LONG MAYBE IT WAS I THAT PULLED THE TRIGGER MAYBE WE JUST JOLTED IT
OFF BETWEEN US ANYHOW HE GOT BOTH BARRELS IN THE FACE AND THERE I
WAS STARING DOWN AT ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF TED BALDWIN ID RECOGNIZED
HIM IN THE TOWNSHIP AND AGAIN WHEN HE SPRANG FOR ME BUT HIS OWN
MOTHER WOULDNT RECOGNIZE HIM AS I SAW HIM THEN IM USED TO ROUGH
WORK BUT I FAIRLY TURNED SICK AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
I WAS HANGING ON THE SIDE OF THE TABLE WHEN BARKER CAME HURRYING
DOWN I HEARD MY WIFE COMING AND I RAN TO THE DOOR AND STOPPED HER
IT WAS NO SIGHT FOR A WOMAN I PROMISED ID COME TO HER SOON I SAID
A WORD OR TWO TO BARKERHE TOOK IT ALL IN AT A GLANCEAND WE WAITED
FOR THE REST TO COME ALONG BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THEM THEN WE
UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY COULD HEAR NOTHING AND THAT ALL THAT HAD
HAPPENED WAS KNOWN ONLY TO OURSELVES
IT WAS AT THAT INSTANT THAT THE IDEA CAME TO ME I WAS FAIRLY
DAZZLED BY THE BRILLIANCE OF IT THE MANS SLEEVE HAD SLIPPED UP AND
THERE WAS THE BRANDED MARK OF THE LODGE UPON HIS FOREARM SEE HERE
THE MAN WHOM WE HAD KNOWN AS DOUGLAS TURNED UP HIS OWN COAT AND CUFF
TO SHOW A BROWN TRIANGLE WITHIN A CIRCLE EXACTLY LIKE THAT WHICH WE
HAD SEEN UPON THE DEAD MAN
IT WAS THE SIGHT OF THAT WHICH STARTED ME ON IT I SEEMED TO SEE IT
ALL CLEAR AT A GLANCE THERE WERE HIS HEIGHT AND HAIR AND FIGURE
ABOUT THE SAME AS MY OWN NO ONE COULD SWEAR TO HIS FACE POOR DEVIL
I BROUGHT DOWN THIS SUIT OF CLOTHES AND IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
BARKER AND I HAD PUT MY DRESSING GOWN ON HIM AND HE LAY AS YOU FOUND
HIM WE TIED ALL HIS THINGS INTO A BUNDLE AND I WEIGHTED THEM WITH
THE ONLY WEIGHT I COULD FIND AND PUT THEM THROUGH THE WINDOW THE
CARD HE HAD MEANT TO LAY UPON MY BODY WAS LYING BESIDE HIS OWN
MY RINGS WERE PUT ON HIS FINGER BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE WEDDING
RING HE HELD OUT HIS MUSCULAR HAND YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELVES
THAT I HAD STRUCK THE LIMIT I HAVE NOT MOVED IT SINCE THE DAY I WAS
MARRIED AND IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A FILE TO GET IT OFF I DONT KNOW
ANYHOW THAT I SHOULD HAVE CARED TO PART WITH IT BUT IF I HAD WANTED
TO I COULDNT SO WE JUST HAD TO LEAVE THAT DETAIL TO TAKE CARE OF
ITSELF ON THE OTHER HAND I BROUGHT A BIT OF PLASTER DOWN AND PUT IT
WHERE I AM WEARING ONE MYSELF AT THIS INSTANT YOU SLIPPED UP THERE
MR HOLMES CLEVER AS YOU ARE FOR IF YOU HAD CHANCED TO TAKE OFF
THAT PLASTER YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND NO CUT UNDERNEATH IT
WELL THAT WAS THE SITUATION IF I COULD LIE LOW FOR A WHILE AND
THEN GET AWAY WHERE I COULD BE JOINED BY MY WIDOW WE SHOULD HAVE A
CHANCE AT LAST OF LIVING IN PEACE FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES THESE
DEVILS WOULD GIVE ME NO REST SO LONG AS I WAS ABOVE GROUND BUT IF
THEY SAW IN THE PAPERS THAT BALDWIN HAD GOT HIS MAN THERE WOULD BE
AN END OF ALL MY TROUBLES I HADNT MUCH TIME TO MAKE IT ALL CLEAR TO
BARKER AND TO MY WIFE BUT THEY UNDERSTOOD ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO HELP
ME I KNEW ALL ABOUT THIS HIDING PLACE SO DID AMES BUT IT NEVER
ENTERED HIS HEAD TO CONNECT IT WITH THE MATTER I RETIRED INTO IT
AND IT WAS UP TO BARKER TO DO THE REST
I GUESS YOU CAN FILL IN FOR YOURSELVES WHAT HE DID HE OPENED THE
WINDOW AND MADE THE MARK ON THE SILL TO GIVE AN IDEA OF HOW THE
MURDERER ESCAPED IT WAS A TALL ORDER THAT BUT AS THE BRIDGE WAS UP
THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY THEN WHEN EVERYTHING WAS FIXED HE RANG THE
BELL FOR ALL HE WAS WORTH WHAT HAPPENED AFTERWARD YOU KNOW AND SO
GENTLEMEN YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU PLEASE BUT IVE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH
AND THE WHOLE TRUTH SO HELP ME GOD WHAT I ASK YOU NOW IS HOW DO I
STAND BY THE ENGLISH LAW
THERE WAS A SILENCE WHICH WAS BROKEN BY SHERLOCK HOLMES
THE ENGLISH LAW IS IN THE MAIN A JUST LAW YOU WILL GET NO WORSE
THAN YOUR DESERTS FROM THAT MR DOUGLAS BUT I WOULD ASK YOU HOW DID
THIS MAN KNOW THAT YOU LIVED HERE OR HOW TO GET INTO YOUR HOUSE OR
WHERE TO HIDE TO GET YOU
I KNOW NOTHING OF THIS
HOLMESS FACE WAS VERY WHITE AND GRAVE THE STORY IS NOT OVER YET I
FEAR SAID HE YOU MAY FIND WORSE DANGERS THAN THE ENGLISH LAW OR
EVEN THAN YOUR ENEMIES FROM AMERICA I SEE TROUBLE BEFORE YOU MR
DOUGLAS YOULL TAKE MY ADVICE AND STILL BE ON YOUR GUARD
AND NOW MY LONGSUFFERING READERS I WILL ASK YOU TO COME AWAY WITH
ME FOR A TIME FAR FROM THE SUSSEX MANOR HOUSE OF BIRLSTONE AND FAR
ALSO FROM THE YEAR OF GRACE IN WHICH WE MADE OUR EVENTFUL JOURNEY
WHICH ENDED WITH THE STRANGE STORY OF THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN KNOWN AS
JOHN DOUGLAS I WISH YOU TO JOURNEY BACK SOME TWENTY YEARS IN TIME
AND WESTWARD SOME THOUSANDS OF MILES IN SPACE THAT I MAY LAY BEFORE
YOU A SINGULAR AND TERRIBLE NARRATIVESO SINGULAR AND SO TERRIBLE
THAT YOU MAY FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT EVEN AS I TELL IT EVEN SO
DID IT OCCUR
DO NOT THINK THAT I INTRUDE ONE STORY BEFORE ANOTHER IS FINISHED AS
YOU READ ON YOU WILL FIND THAT THIS IS NOT SO AND WHEN I HAVE
DETAILED THOSE DISTANT EVENTS AND YOU HAVE SOLVED THIS MYSTERY OF THE
PAST WE SHALL MEET ONCE MORE IN THOSE ROOMS ON BAKER STREET WHERE
THIS LIKE SO MANY OTHER WONDERFUL HAPPENINGS WILL FIND ITS END
PART II
THE SCOWRERS
CHAPTER I
THE MAN
IT WAS THE FOURTH OF FEBRUARY IN THE YEAR IT HAD BEEN A SEVERE
WINTER AND THE SNOW LAY DEEP IN THE GORGES OF THE GILMERTON
MOUNTAINS THE STEAM PLOUGHS HAD HOWEVER KEPT THE RAILROAD OPEN
AND THE EVENING TRAIN WHICH CONNECTS THE LONG LINE OF COALMINING AND
IRONWORKING SETTLEMENTS WAS SLOWLY GROANING ITS WAY UP THE STEEP
GRADIENTS WHICH LEAD FROM STAGVILLE ON THE PLAIN TO VERMISSA THE
CENTRAL TOWNSHIP WHICH LIES AT THE HEAD OF VERMISSA VALLEY FROM THIS
POINT THE TRACK SWEEPS DOWNWARD TO BARTONS CROSSING HELMDALE AND
THE PURELY AGRICULTURAL COUNTY OF MERTON IT WAS A SINGLETRACK
RAILROAD BUT AT EVERY SIDINGAND THEY WERE NUMEROUSLONG LINES OF
TRUCKS PILED WITH COAL AND IRON ORE TOLD OF THE HIDDEN WEALTH WHICH
HAD BROUGHT A RUDE POPULATION AND A BUSTLING LIFE TO THIS MOST
DESOLATE CORNER OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
FOR DESOLATE IT WAS LITTLE COULD THE FIRST PIONEER WHO HAD TRAVERSED
IT HAVE EVER IMAGINED THAT THE FAIREST PRAIRIES AND THE MOST LUSH
WATER PASTURES WERE VALUELESS COMPARED TO THIS GLOOMY LAND OF BLACK
CRAG AND TANGLED FOREST ABOVE THE DARK AND OFTEN SCARCELY PENETRABLE
WOODS UPON THEIR FLANKS THE HIGH BARE CROWNS OF THE MOUNTAINS
WHITE SNOW AND JAGGED ROCK TOWERED UPON EACH FLANK LEAVING A LONG
WINDING TORTUOUS VALLEY IN THE CENTRE UP THIS THE LITTLE TRAIN WAS
SLOWLY CRAWLING
THE OIL LAMPS HAD JUST BEEN LIT IN THE LEADING PASSENGER CAR A LONG
BARE CARRIAGE IN WHICH SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PEOPLE WERE SEATED THE
GREATER NUMBER OF THESE WERE WORKMEN RETURNING FROM THEIR DAYS TOIL
IN THE LOWER PART OF THE VALLEY AT LEAST A DOZEN BY THEIR GRIMED
FACES AND THE SAFETY LANTERNS WHICH THEY CARRIED PROCLAIMED
THEMSELVES MINERS THESE SAT SMOKING IN A GROUP AND CONVERSED IN LOW
VOICES GLANCING OCCASIONALLY AT TWO MEN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE
CAR WHOSE UNIFORMS AND BADGES SHOWED THEM TO BE POLICEMEN
SEVERAL WOMEN OF THE LABOURING CLASS AND ONE OR TWO TRAVELLERS WHO
MIGHT HAVE BEEN SMALL LOCAL STOREKEEPERS MADE UP THE REST OF THE
COMPANY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE YOUNG MAN IN A CORNER BY HIMSELF
IT IS WITH THIS MAN THAT WE ARE CONCERNED TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT HIM
FOR HE IS WORTH IT
HE IS A FRESHCOMPLEXIONED MIDDLESIZED YOUNG MAN NOT FAR ONE
WOULD GUESS FROM HIS THIRTIETH YEAR HE HAS LARGE SHREWD HUMOROUS
GRAY EYES WHICH TWINKLE INQUIRINGLY FROM TIME TO TIME AS HE LOOKS
ROUND THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES AT THE PEOPLE ABOUT HIM IT IS EASY TO
SEE THAT HE IS OF A SOCIABLE AND POSSIBLY SIMPLE DISPOSITION ANXIOUS
TO BE FRIENDLY TO ALL MEN ANYONE COULD PICK HIM AT ONCE AS
GREGARIOUS IN HIS HABITS AND COMMUNICATIVE IN HIS NATURE WITH A
QUICK WIT AND A READY SMILE AND YET THE MAN WHO STUDIED HIM MORE
CLOSELY MIGHT DISCERN A CERTAIN FIRMNESS OF JAW AND GRIM TIGHTNESS
ABOUT THE LIPS WHICH WOULD WARN HIM THAT THERE WERE DEPTHS BEYOND
AND THAT THIS PLEASANT BROWNHAIRED YOUNG IRISHMAN MIGHT CONCEIVABLY
LEAVE HIS MARK FOR GOOD OR EVIL UPON ANY SOCIETY TO WHICH HE WAS
INTRODUCED
HAVING MADE ONE OR TWO TENTATIVE REMARKS TO THE NEAREST MINER AND
RECEIVING ONLY SHORT GRUFF REPLIES THE TRAVELLER RESIGNED HIMSELF
TO UNCONGENIAL SILENCE STARING MOODILY OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE
FADING LANDSCAPE
IT WAS NOT A CHEERING PROSPECT THROUGH THE GROWING GLOOM THERE
PULSED THE RED GLOW OF THE FURNACES ON THE SIDES OF THE HILLS GREAT
HEAPS OF SLAG AND DUMPS OF CINDERS LOOMED UP ON EACH SIDE WITH THE
HIGH SHAFTS OF THE COLLIERIES TOWERING ABOVE THEM HUDDLED GROUPS OF
MEAN WOODEN HOUSES THE WINDOWS OF WHICH WERE BEGINNING TO OUTLINE
THEMSELVES IN LIGHT WERE SCATTERED HERE AND THERE ALONG THE LINE
AND THE FREQUENT HALTING PLACES WERE CROWDED WITH THEIR SWARTHY
INHABITANTS
THE IRON AND COAL VALLEYS OF THE VERMISSA DISTRICT WERE NO RESORTS
FOR THE LEISURED OR THE CULTURED EVERYWHERE THERE WERE STERN SIGNS
OF THE CRUDEST BATTLE OF LIFE THE RUDE WORK TO BE DONE AND THE
RUDE STRONG WORKERS WHO DID IT
THE YOUNG TRAVELLER GAZED OUT INTO THIS DISMAL COUNTRY WITH A FACE OF
MINGLED REPULSION AND INTEREST WHICH SHOWED THAT THE SCENE WAS NEW
TO HIM AT INTERVALS HE DREW FROM HIS POCKET A BULKY LETTER TO WHICH
HE REFERRED AND ON THE MARGINS OF WHICH HE SCRIBBLED SOME NOTES
ONCE FROM THE BACK OF HIS WAIST HE PRODUCED SOMETHING WHICH ONE WOULD
HARDLY HAVE EXPECTED TO FIND IN THE POSSESSION OF SO MILDMANNERED A
MAN IT WAS A NAVY REVOLVER OF THE LARGEST SIZE AS HE TURNED IT
SLANTWISE TO THE LIGHT THE GLINT UPON THE RIMS OF THE COPPER SHELLS
WITHIN THE DRUM SHOWED THAT IT WAS FULLY LOADED HE QUICKLY RESTORED
IT TO HIS SECRET POCKET BUT NOT BEFORE IT HAD BEEN OBSERVED BY A
WORKING MAN WHO HAD SEATED HIMSELF UPON THE ADJOINING BENCH
HULLO MATE SAID HE YOU SEEM HEELED AND READY
THE YOUNG MAN SMILED WITH AN AIR OF EMBARRASSMENT
YES SAID HE WE NEED THEM SOMETIMES IN THE PLACE I COME FROM
AND WHERE MAY THAT BE
IM LAST FROM CHICAGO
A STRANGER IN THESE PARTS

WHAT MADE YOU COME HERE
I HEARD THERE WAS ALWAYS WORK FOR A WILLING MAN

NOT YET BUT I HAVE THE MEANS OF MAKING THEM
HOWS THAT THEN
I AM ONE OF THE EMINENT ORDER OF FREEMEN THERES NO TOWN WITHOUT A
LODGE AND WHERE THERE IS A LODGE ILL FIND MY FRIENDS
THE REMARK HAD A SINGULAR EFFECT UPON HIS COMPANION HE GLANCED ROUND
SUSPICIOUSLY AT THE OTHERS IN THE CAR THE MINERS WERE STILL
WHISPERING AMONG THEMSELVES THE TWO POLICE OFFICERS WERE DOZING HE
CAME ACROSS SEATED HIMSELF CLOSE TO THE YOUNG TRAVELLER AND HELD
OUT HIS HAND
PUT IT THERE HE SAID
A HANDGRIP PASSED BETWEEN THE TWO
I SEE YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH SAID THE WORKMAN BUT ITS WELL TO MAKE
CERTAIN HE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND TO HIS RIGHT EYEBROW THE
TRAVELLER AT ONCE RAISED HIS LEFT HAND TO HIS LEFT EYEBROW
DARK NIGHTS ARE UNPLEASANT SAID THE WORKMAN
YES FOR STRANGERS TO TRAVEL THE OTHER ANSWERED

SCANLAN GROANED SYMPATHETICALLY IN TROUBLE HE ASKED IN A WHISPER
DEEP

OF A MAN WHO HAD BEEN SURPRISED INTO SAYING MORE THAN HE INTENDED
IVE MY OWN GOOD REASONS FOR LEAVING CHICAGO AND LET THAT BE ENOUGH

MATE MAYBE WELL MEET IN LODGE ONE OF THESE EVENINGS BUT MIND MY
WORDS IF YOU ARE IN TROUBLE GO TO BOSS MCGINTY
SCANLAN DESCENDED AND MCMURDO WAS LEFT ONCE AGAIN TO HIS THOUGHTS
NIGHT HAD NOW FALLEN AND THE FLAMES OF THE FREQUENT FURNACES WERE
ROARING AND LEAPING IN THE DARKNESS AGAINST THEIR LURID BACKGROUND
DARK FIGURES WERE BENDING AND STRAINING TWISTING AND TURNING WITH
THE MOTION OF WINCH OR OF WINDLASS TO THE RHYTHM OF AN ETERNAL CLANK
AND ROAR
I GUESS HELL MUST LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THAT SAID A VOICE
MCMURDO TURNED AND SAW THAT ONE OF THE POLICEMEN HAD SHIFTED IN HIS
SEAT AND WAS STARING OUT INTO THE FIERY WASTE
FOR THAT MATTER SAID THE OTHER POLICEMAN I ALLOW THAT HELL MUST
BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF THERE ARE WORSE DEVILS DOWN YONDER THAN
SOME WE COULD NAME ITS MORE THAN ID EXPECT I GUESS YOU ARE NEW TO

VOICE WHICH BROUGHT EVERY HEAD IN THE CARRIAGE ROUND TO WITNESS THE
ALTERCATION DID I ASK YOU FOR YOUR ADVICE OR DID YOU THINK ME SUCH
A SUCKER THAT I COULDNT MOVE WITHOUT IT YOU SPEAK WHEN YOU ARE
SPOKEN TO AND BY THE LORD YOUD HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME IF IT WAS
ME HE THRUST OUT HIS FACE AND GRINNED AT THE PATROLMEN LIKE A
SNARLING DOG
THE TWO POLICEMEN HEAVY GOODNATURED MEN WERE TAKEN ABACK BY THE
EXTRAORDINARY VEHEMENCE WITH WHICH THEIR FRIENDLY ADVANCES HAD BEEN
REJECTED
NO OFFENSE STRANGER SAID ONE IT WAS A WARNING FOR YOUR OWN
GOOD SEEING THAT YOU ARE BY YOUR OWN SHOWING NEW TO THE PLACE

SHAFTERS ON SHERIDAN STREET VERMISSA SO IM NOT HIDING FROM YOU
AM I DAY OR NIGHT I DARE TO LOOK THE LIKE OF YOU IN THE FACEDONT
MAKE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT THAT
THERE WAS A MURMUR OF SYMPATHY AND ADMIRATION FROM THE MINERS AT THE
DAUNTLESS DEMEANOUR OF THE NEWCOMER WHILE THE TWO POLICEMEN SHRUGGED
THEIR SHOULDERS AND RENEWED A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEMSELVES
A FEW MINUTES LATER THE TRAIN RAN INTO THE ILLLIT STATION AND THERE
WAS A GENERAL CLEARING FOR VERMISSA WAS BY FAR THE LARGEST TOWN ON
THE LINE MCMURDO PICKED UP HIS LEATHER GRIPSACK AND WAS ABOUT TO
START OFF INTO THE DARKNESS WHEN ONE OF THE MINERS ACCOSTED HIM
BY GAR MATE YOU KNOW HOW TO SPEAK TO THE COPS HE SAID IN A VOICE
OF AWE IT WAS GRAND TO HEAR YOU LET ME CARRY YOUR GRIP AND SHOW
YOU THE ROAD IM PASSING SHAFTERS ON THE WAY TO MY OWN SHACK
THERE WAS A CHORUS OF FRIENDLY GOODNIGHTS FROM THE OTHER MINERS AS
THEY PASSED FROM THE PLATFORM BEFORE EVER HE HAD SET FOOT IN IT
MCMURDO THE TURBULENT HAD BECOME A CHARACTER IN VERMISSA
THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN A PLACE OF TERROR BUT THE TOWN WAS IN ITS WAY
EVEN MORE DEPRESSING DOWN THAT LONG VALLEY THERE WAS AT LEAST A
CERTAIN GLOOMY GRANDEUR IN THE HUGE FIRES AND THE CLOUDS OF DRIFTING
SMOKE WHILE THE STRENGTH AND INDUSTRY OF MAN FOUND FITTING MONUMENTS
IN THE HILLS WHICH HE HAD SPILLED BY THE SIDE OF HIS MONSTROUS
EXCAVATIONS BUT THE TOWN SHOWED A DEAD LEVEL OF MEAN UGLINESS AND
SQUALOR THE BROAD STREET WAS CHURNED UP BY THE TRAFFIC INTO A
HORRIBLE RUTTED PASTE OF MUDDY SNOW THE SIDEWALKS WERE NARROW AND
UNEVEN THE NUMEROUS GASLAMPS SERVED ONLY TO SHOW MORE CLEARLY A
LONG LINE OF WOODEN HOUSES EACH WITH ITS VERANDA FACING THE STREET
UNKEMPT AND DIRTY
AS THEY APPROACHED THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN THE SCENE WAS BRIGHTENED BY
A ROW OF WELLLIT STORES AND EVEN MORE BY A CLUSTER OF SALOONS AND
GAMING HOUSES IN WHICH THE MINERS SPENT THEIR HARDEARNED BUT
GENEROUS WAGES
THATS THE UNION HOUSE SAID THE GUIDE POINTING TO ONE SALOON
WHICH ROSE ALMOST TO THE DIGNITY OF BEING A HOTEL JACK MCGINTY IS
THE BOSS THERE
WHAT SORT OF A MAN IS HE MCMURDO ASKED
WHAT HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE BOSS
HOW COULD I HAVE HEARD OF HIM WHEN YOU KNOW THAT I AM A STRANGER IN
THESE PARTS
WELL I THOUGHT HIS NAME WAS KNOWN CLEAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY ITS
BEEN IN THE PAPERS OFTEN ENOUGH
WHAT FOR
WELL THE MINER LOWERED HIS VOICEOVER THE AFFAIRS
WHAT AFFAIRS
GOOD LORD MISTER YOU ARE QUEER IF I MUST SAY IT WITHOUT OFFENSE
THERES ONLY ONE SET OF AFFAIRS THAT YOULL HEAR OF IN THESE PARTS
AND THATS THE AFFAIRS OF THE SCOWRERS
WHY I SEEM TO HAVE READ OF THE SCOWRERS IN CHICAGO A GANG OF
MURDERERS ARE THEY NOT
HUSH ON YOUR LIFE CRIED THE MINER STANDING STILL IN ALARM AND
GAZING IN AMAZEMENT AT HIS COMPANION MAN YOU WONT LIVE LONG IN
THESE PARTS IF YOU SPEAK IN THE OPEN STREET LIKE THAT MANY A MAN HAS
HAD THE LIFE BEATEN OUT OF HIM FOR LESS
WELL I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THEM ITS ONLY WHAT I HAVE READ
AND IM NOT SAYING THAT YOU HAVE NOT READ THE TRUTH THE MAN LOOKED
NERVOUSLY ROUND HIM AS HE SPOKE PEERING INTO THE SHADOWS AS IF HE
FEARED TO SEE SOME LURKING DANGER IF KILLING IS MURDER THEN GOD
KNOWS THERE IS MURDER AND TO SPARE BUT DONT YOU DARE TO BREATHE THE
NAME OF JACK MCGINTY IN CONNECTION WITH IT STRANGER FOR EVERY
WHISPER GOES BACK TO HIM AND HE IS NOT ONE THAT IS LIKELY TO LET IT
PASS NOW THATS THE HOUSE YOURE AFTER THAT ONE STANDING BACK FROM
THE STREET YOULL FIND OLD JACOB SHAFTER THAT RUNS IT AS HONEST A
MAN AS LIVES IN THIS TOWNSHIP
I THANK YOU SAID MCMURDO AND SHAKING HANDS WITH HIS NEW
ACQUAINTANCE HE PLODDED GRIPSACK IN HAND UP THE PATH WHICH LED TO
THE DWELLING HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE GAVE A RESOUNDING KNOCK
IT WAS OPENED AT ONCE BY SOMEONE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HE HAD
EXPECTED IT WAS A WOMAN YOUNG AND SINGULARLY BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS OF
THE GERMAN TYPE BLONDE AND FAIRHAIRED WITH THE PIQUANT CONTRAST OF
A PAIR OF BEAUTIFUL DARK EYES WITH WHICH SHE SURVEYED THE STRANGER
WITH SURPRISE AND A PLEASING EMBARRASSMENT WHICH BROUGHT A WAVE OF
COLOUR OVER HER PALE FACE FRAMED IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE OPEN
DOORWAY IT SEEMED TO MCMURDO THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN A MORE BEAUTIFUL
PICTURE THE MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR ITS CONTRAST WITH THE SORDID AND
GLOOMY SURROUNDINGS A LOVELY VIOLET GROWING UPON ONE OF THOSE BLACK
SLAGHEAPS OF THE MINES WOULD NOT HAVE SEEMED MORE SURPRISING SO
ENTRANCED WAS HE THAT HE STOOD STARING WITHOUT A WORD AND IT WAS SHE
WHO BROKE THE SILENCE
I THOUGHT IT WAS FATHER SAID SHE WITH A PLEASING LITTLE TOUCH OF A
GERMAN ACCENT DID YOU COME TO SEE HIM HE IS DOWNTOWN I EXPECT HIM
BACK EVERY MINUTE
MCMURDO CONTINUED TO GAZE AT HER IN OPEN ADMIRATION UNTIL HER EYES
DROPPED IN CONFUSION BEFORE THIS MASTERFUL VISITOR
NO MISS HE SAID AT LAST IM IN NO HURRY TO SEE HIM BUT YOUR
HOUSE WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME FOR BOARD I THOUGHT IT MIGHT SUIT
MEAND NOW I KNOW IT WILL
YOU ARE QUICK TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND SAID SHE WITH A SMILE
ANYONE BUT A BLIND MAN COULD DO AS MUCH THE OTHER ANSWERED
SHE LAUGHED AT THE COMPLIMENT COME RIGHT IN SIR SHE SAID IM
MISS ETTIE SHAFTER MR SHAFTERS DAUGHTER MY MOTHERS DEAD AND I
RUN THE HOUSE YOU CAN SIT DOWN BY THE STOVE IN THE FRONT ROOM UNTIL
FATHER COMES ALONGAH HERE HE IS SO YOU CAN FIX THINGS WITH HIM
RIGHT AWAY
A HEAVY ELDERLY MAN CAME PLODDING UP THE PATH IN A FEW WORDS
MCMURDO EXPLAINED HIS BUSINESS A MAN OF THE NAME OF MURPHY HAD GIVEN
HIM THE ADDRESS IN CHICAGO HE IN TURN HAD HAD IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE
OLD SHAFTER WAS QUITE READY THE STRANGER MADE NO BONES ABOUT TERMS
AGREED AT ONCE TO EVERY CONDITION AND WAS APPARENTLY FAIRLY FLUSH OF
MONEY FOR SEVEN DOLLARS A WEEK PAID IN ADVANCE HE WAS TO HAVE BOARD
AND LODGING
SO IT WAS THAT MCMURDO THE SELFCONFESSED FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE
TOOK UP HIS ABODE UNDER THE ROOF OF THE SHAFTERS THE FIRST STEP
WHICH WAS TO LEAD TO SO LONG AND DARK A TRAIN OF EVENTS ENDING IN A
FAR DISTANT LAND
CHAPTER II
THE BODYMASTER
MCMURDO WAS A MAN WHO MADE HIS MARK QUICKLY WHEREVER HE WAS THE FOLK
AROUND SOON KNEW IT WITHIN A WEEK HE HAD BECOME INFINITELY THE MOST
IMPORTANT PERSON AT SHAFTERS THERE WERE TEN OR A DOZEN BOARDERS
THERE BUT THEY WERE HONEST FOREMEN OR COMMONPLACE CLERKS FROM THE
STORES OF A VERY DIFFERENT CALIBRE FROM THE YOUNG IRISHMAN OF AN
EVENING WHEN THEY GATHERED TOGETHER HIS JOKE WAS ALWAYS THE READIEST
HIS CONVERSATION THE BRIGHTEST AND HIS SONG THE BEST HE WAS A BORN
BOON COMPANION WITH A MAGNETISM WHICH DREW GOOD HUMOUR FROM ALL
AROUND HIM
AND YET HE SHOWED AGAIN AND AGAIN AS HE HAD SHOWN IN THE RAILWAY
CARRIAGE A CAPACITY FOR SUDDEN FIERCE ANGER WHICH COMPELLED THE
RESPECT AND EVEN THE FEAR OF THOSE WHO MET HIM FOR THE LAW TOO AND
ALL WHO WERE CONNECTED WITH IT HE EXHIBITED A BITTER CONTEMPT WHICH
DELIGHTED SOME AND ALARMED OTHERS OF HIS FELLOW BOARDERS
FROM THE FIRST HE MADE IT EVIDENT BY HIS OPEN ADMIRATION THAT THE
DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE HAD WON HIS HEART FROM THE INSTANT THAT HE HAD
SET EYES UPON HER BEAUTY AND HER GRACE HE WAS NO BACKWARD SUITOR ON
THE SECOND DAY HE TOLD HER THAT HE LOVED HER AND FROM THEN ONWARD HE
REPEATED THE SAME STORY WITH AN ABSOLUTE DISREGARD OF WHAT SHE MIGHT
SAY TO DISCOURAGE HIM
SOMEONE ELSE HE WOULD CRY WELL THE WORSE LUCK FOR SOMEONE ELSE
LET HIM LOOK OUT FOR HIMSELF AM I TO LOSE MY LIFES CHANCE AND ALL
MY HEARTS DESIRE FOR SOMEONE ELSE YOU CAN KEEP ON SAYING NO ETTIE
THE DAY WILL COME WHEN YOU WILL SAY YES AND IM YOUNG ENOUGH TO
WAIT
HE WAS A DANGEROUS SUITOR WITH HIS GLIB IRISH TONGUE AND HIS
PRETTY COAXING WAYS THERE WAS ABOUT HIM ALSO THAT GLAMOUR OF
EXPERIENCE AND OF MYSTERY WHICH ATTRACTS A WOMANS INTEREST AND
FINALLY HER LOVE HE COULD TALK OF THE SWEET VALLEYS OF COUNTY
MONAGHAN FROM WHICH HE CAME OF THE LOVELY DISTANT ISLAND THE LOW
HILLS AND GREEN MEADOWS OF WHICH SEEMED THE MORE BEAUTIFUL WHEN
IMAGINATION VIEWED THEM FROM THIS PLACE OF GRIME AND SNOW
THEN HE WAS VERSED IN THE LIFE OF THE CITIES OF THE NORTH OF
DETROIT AND THE LUMBER CAMPS OF MICHIGAN AND FINALLY OF CHICAGO
WHERE HE HAD WORKED IN A PLANING MILL AND AFTERWARDS CAME THE HINT
OF ROMANCE THE FEELING THAT STRANGE THINGS HAD HAPPENED TO HIM IN
THAT GREAT CITY SO STRANGE AND SO INTIMATE THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE
SPOKEN OF HE SPOKE WISTFULLY OF A SUDDEN LEAVING A BREAKING OF OLD
TIES A FLIGHT INTO A STRANGE WORLD ENDING IN THIS DREARY VALLEY
AND ETTIE LISTENED HER DARK EYES GLEAMING WITH PITY AND WITH
SYMPATHYTHOSE TWO QUALITIES WHICH MAY TURN SO RAPIDLY AND SO
NATURALLY TO LOVE
MCMURDO HAD OBTAINED A TEMPORARY JOB AS BOOKKEEPER FOR HE WAS A
WELLEDUCATED MAN THIS KEPT HIM OUT MOST OF THE DAY AND HE HAD NOT
FOUND OCCASION YET TO REPORT HIMSELF TO THE HEAD OF THE LODGE OF THE
EMINENT ORDER OF FREEMEN HE WAS REMINDED OF HIS OMISSION HOWEVER
BY A VISIT ONE EVENING FROM MIKE SCANLAN THE FELLOW MEMBER WHOM HE
HAD MET IN THE TRAIN SCANLAN THE SMALL SHARPFACED NERVOUS
BLACKEYED MAN SEEMED GLAD TO SEE HIM ONCE MORE AFTER A GLASS OR
TWO OF WHISKY HE BROACHED THE OBJECT OF HIS VISIT

IT CHANCED THAT ON THE SAME EVENING MCMURDO HAD ANOTHER MORE PRESSING
INTERVIEW WHICH URGED HIM IN THE SAME DIRECTION IT MAY HAVE BEEN
THAT HIS ATTENTIONS TO ETTIE HAD BEEN MORE EVIDENT THAN BEFORE OR
THAT THEY HAD GRADUALLY OBTRUDED THEMSELVES INTO THE SLOW MIND OF HIS
GOOD GERMAN HOST BUT WHATEVER THE CAUSE THE BOARDINGHOUSE KEEPER

ON YOUR TRAIL
I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING SAID MCMURDO ILL GO RIGHT NOW AND
FIX IT YOU CAN TELL YOUR FATHER THAT ILL SLEEP HERE TONIGHT AND
FIND SOME OTHER QUARTERS IN THE MORNING
THE BAR OF MCGINTYS SALOON WAS CROWDED AS USUAL FOR IT WAS THE
FAVOURITE LOAFING PLACE OF ALL THE ROUGHER ELEMENTS OF THE TOWN THE
MAN WAS POPULAR FOR HE HAD A ROUGH JOVIAL DISPOSITION WHICH FORMED
A MASK COVERING A GREAT DEAL WHICH LAY BEHIND IT BUT APART FROM
THIS POPULARITY THE FEAR IN WHICH HE WAS HELD THROUGHOUT THE
TOWNSHIP AND INDEED DOWN THE WHOLE THIRTY MILES OF THE VALLEY AND
PAST THE MOUNTAINS ON EACH SIDE OF IT WAS ENOUGH IN ITSELF TO FILL
HIS BAR FOR NONE COULD AFFORD TO NEGLECT HIS GOOD WILL
BESIDES THOSE SECRET POWERS WHICH IT WAS UNIVERSALLY BELIEVED THAT HE
EXERCISED IN SO PITILESS A FASHION HE WAS A HIGH PUBLIC OFFICIAL A
MUNICIPAL COUNCILLOR AND A COMMISSIONER OF ROADS ELECTED TO THE
OFFICE THROUGH THE VOTES OF THE RUFFIANS WHO IN TURN EXPECTED TO
RECEIVE FAVOURS AT HIS HANDS ASSESSMENTS AND TAXES WERE ENORMOUS
THE PUBLIC WORKS WERE NOTORIOUSLY NEGLECTED THE ACCOUNTS WERE
SLURRED OVER BY BRIBED AUDITORS AND THE DECENT CITIZEN WAS
TERRORIZED INTO PAYING PUBLIC BLACKMAIL AND HOLDING HIS TONGUE LEST
SOME WORSE THING BEFALL HIM
THUS IT WAS THAT YEAR BY YEAR BOSS MCGINTYS DIAMOND PINS BECAME
MORE OBTRUSIVE HIS GOLD CHAINS MORE WEIGHTY ACROSS A MORE GORGEOUS
VEST AND HIS SALOON STRETCHED FARTHER AND FARTHER UNTIL IT
THREATENED TO ABSORB ONE WHOLE SIDE OF THE MARKET SQUARE
MCMURDO PUSHED OPEN THE SWINGING DOOR OF THE SALOON AND MADE HIS WAY
AMID THE CROWD OF MEN WITHIN THROUGH AN ATMOSPHERE BLURRED WITH
TOBACCO SMOKE AND HEAVY WITH THE SMELL OF SPIRITS THE PLACE WAS
BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED AND THE HUGE HEAVILY GILT MIRRORS UPON EVERY
WALL REFLECTED AND MULTIPLIED THE GARISH ILLUMINATION THERE WERE
SEVERAL BARTENDERS IN THEIR SHIRT SLEEVES HARD AT WORK MIXING DRINKS
FOR THE LOUNGERS WHO FRINGED THE BROAD BRASSTRIMMED COUNTER
AT THE FAR END WITH HIS BODY RESTING UPON THE BAR AND A CIGAR STUCK
AT AN ACUTE ANGLE FROM THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH STOOD A TALL STRONG
HEAVILY BUILT MAN WHO COULD BE NONE OTHER THAN THE FAMOUS MCGINTY
HIMSELF HE WAS A BLACKMANED GIANT BEARDED TO THE CHEEKBONES AND
WITH A SHOCK OF RAVEN HAIR WHICH FELL TO HIS COLLAR HIS COMPLEXION
WAS AS SWARTHY AS THAT OF AN ITALIAN AND HIS EYES WERE OF A STRANGE
DEAD BLACK WHICH COMBINED WITH A SLIGHT SQUINT GAVE THEM A
PARTICULARLY SINISTER APPEARANCE
ALL ELSE IN THE MANHIS NOBLE PROPORTIONS HIS FINE FEATURES AND
HIS FRANK BEARINGFITTED IN WITH THAT JOVIAL MANTOMAN MANNER
WHICH HE AFFECTED HERE ONE WOULD SAY IS A BLUFF HONEST FELLOW
WHOSE HEART WOULD BE SOUND HOWEVER RUDE HIS OUTSPOKEN WORDS MIGHT
SEEM IT WAS ONLY WHEN THOSE DEAD DARK EYES DEEP AND REMORSELESS
WERE TURNED UPON A MAN THAT HE SHRANK WITHIN HIMSELF FEELING THAT HE
WAS FACE TO FACE WITH AN INFINITE POSSIBILITY OF LATENT EVIL WITH A
STRENGTH AND COURAGE AND CUNNING BEHIND IT WHICH MADE IT A THOUSAND
TIMES MORE DEADLY
HAVING HAD A GOOD LOOK AT HIS MAN MCMURDO ELBOWED HIS WAY FORWARD
WITH HIS USUAL CARELESS AUDACITY AND PUSHED HIMSELF THROUGH THE
LITTLE GROUP OF COURTIERS WHO WERE FAWNING UPON THE POWERFUL BOSS
LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY AT THE SMALLEST OF HIS JOKES THE YOUNG
STRANGERS BOLD GRAY EYES LOOKED BACK FEARLESSLY THROUGH THEIR
GLASSES AT THE DEADLY BLACK ONES WHICH TURNED SHARPLY UPON HIM
WELL YOUNG MAN I CANT CALL YOUR FACE TO MIND
IM NEW HERE MR MCGINTY
YOU ARE NOT SO NEW THAT YOU CANT GIVE A GENTLEMAN HIS PROPER
TITLE
HES COUNCILLOR MCGINTY YOUNG MAN SAID A VOICE FROM THE GROUP
IM SORRY COUNCILLOR IM STRANGE TO THE WAYS OF THE PLACE BUT I
WAS ADVISED TO SEE YOU
WELL YOU SEE ME THIS IS ALL THERE IS WHAT DYOU THINK OF ME
WELL ITS EARLY DAYS IF YOUR HEART IS AS BIG AS YOUR BODY AND
YOUR SOUL AS FINE AS YOUR FACE THEN ID ASK FOR NOTHING BETTER
SAID MCMURDO
BY GAR YOUVE GOT AN IRISH TONGUE IN YOUR HEAD ANYHOW CRIED THE
SALOONKEEPER NOT QUITE CERTAIN WHETHER TO HUMOUR THIS AUDACIOUS
VISITOR OR TO STAND UPON HIS DIGNITY
SO YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO PASS MY APPEARANCE
SURE SAID MCMURDO
AND YOU WERE TOLD TO SEE ME
I WAS
AND WHO TOLD YOU
BROTHER SCANLAN OF LODGE VERMISSA I DRINK YOUR HEALTH
COUNCILLOR AND TO OUR BETTER ACQUAINTANCE HE RAISED A GLASS WITH
WHICH HE HAD BEEN SERVED TO HIS LIPS AND ELEVATED HIS LITTLE FINGER

MCGINTY WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING HIM NARROWLY RAISED HIS THICK BLACK
EYEBROWS OH ITS LIKE THAT IS IT SAID HE ILL HAVE TO LOOK A
BIT CLOSER INTO THIS MISTER
MCMURDO
A BIT CLOSER MR MCMURDO FOR WE DONT TAKE FOLK ON TRUST IN THESE
PARTS NOR BELIEVE ALL WERE TOLD NEITHER COME IN HERE FOR A MOMENT
BEHIND THE BAR
THERE WAS A SMALL ROOM THERE LINED WITH BARRELS MCGINTY CAREFULLY
CLOSED THE DOOR AND THEN SEATED HIMSELF ON ONE OF THEM BITING
THOUGHTFULLY ON HIS CIGAR AND SURVEYING HIS COMPANION WITH THOSE
DISQUIETING EYES FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES HE SAT IN COMPLETE SILENCE
MCMURDO BORE THE INSPECTION CHEERFULLY ONE HAND IN HIS COAT POCKET
THE OTHER TWISTING HIS BROWN MOUSTACHE SUDDENLY MCGINTY STOOPED AND
PRODUCED A WICKEDLOOKING REVOLVER
SEE HERE MY JOKER SAID HE IF I THOUGHT YOU WERE PLAYING ANY
GAME ON US IT WOULD BE SHORT WORK FOR YOU
THIS IS A STRANGE WELCOME MCMURDO ANSWERED WITH SOME DIGNITY FOR
THE BODYMASTER OF A LODGE OF FREEMEN TO GIVE TO A STRANGER BROTHER

FASHION AND IT AMUSED HIM WHY WONT YOU TELL ME
BECAUSE NO BROTHER MAY TELL ANOTHER A LIE
THEN THE TRUTH IS TOO BAD TO TELL
YOU CAN PUT IT THAT WAY IF YOU LIKE
SEE HERE MISTER YOU CANT EXPECT ME AS BODYMASTER TO PASS INTO
THE LODGE A MAN FOR WHOSE PAST HE CANT ANSWER
MCMURDO LOOKED PUZZLED THEN HE TOOK A WORN NEWSPAPER CUTTING FROM AN
INNER POCKET

APOLOGIZE I SPOKE WITHOUT THOUGHT WELL I KNOW THAT I AM SAFE IN
YOUR HANDS LOOK AT THAT CLIPPING
MCGINTY GLANCED HIS EYES OVER THE ACCOUNT OF THE SHOOTING OF ONE
JONAS PINTO IN THE LAKE SALOON MARKET STREET CHICAGO IN THE NEW

MY SHOES ITS FOR THE LODGE TO SAY THAT BUT SO LONG AS I AM THE
CHIEF ILL HAVE NO MAN LIFT HIS VOICE AGAINST ME OR MY RULINGS
I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST YOU MUMBLED BALDWIN FEELING HIS THROAT
WELL THEN CRIED THE OTHER RELAPSING IN A MOMENT INTO A BLUFF
JOVIALITY WE ARE ALL GOOD FRIENDS AGAIN AND THERES AN END OF THE
MATTER
HE TOOK A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE DOWN FROM THE SHELF AND TWISTED OUT THE
CORK

CHAPTER III
LODGE VERMISSA
ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THE EVENING WHICH HAD CONTAINED SO MANY EXCITING
EVENTS MCMURDO MOVED HIS LODGINGS FROM OLD JACOB SHAFTERS AND TOOK
UP HIS QUARTERS AT THE WIDOW MACNAMARAS ON THE EXTREME OUTSKIRTS OF
THE TOWN SCANLAN HIS ORIGINAL ACQUAINTANCE ABOARD THE TRAIN HAD
OCCASION SHORTLY AFTERWARDS TO MOVE INTO VERMISSA AND THE TWO LODGED
TOGETHER THERE WAS NO OTHER BOARDER AND THE HOSTESS WAS AN
EASYGOING OLD IRISHWOMAN WHO LEFT THEM TO THEMSELVES SO THAT THEY
HAD A FREEDOM FOR SPEECH AND ACTION WELCOME TO MEN WHO HAD SECRETS IN
COMMON
SHAFTER HAD RELENTED TO THE EXTENT OF LETTING MCMURDO COME TO HIS
MEALS THERE WHEN HE LIKED SO THAT HIS INTERCOURSE WITH ETTIE WAS BY
NO MEANS BROKEN ON THE CONTRARY IT DREW CLOSER AND MORE INTIMATE AS
THE WEEKS WENT BY
IN HIS BEDROOM AT HIS NEW ABODE MCMURDO FELT IT SAFE TO TAKE OUT THE
COINING MOULDS AND UNDER MANY A PLEDGE OF SECRECY A NUMBER OF
BROTHERS FROM THE LODGE WERE ALLOWED TO COME IN AND SEE THEM EACH
CARRYING AWAY IN HIS POCKET SOME EXAMPLES OF THE FALSE MONEY SO
CUNNINGLY STRUCK THAT THERE WAS NEVER THE SLIGHTEST DIFFICULTY OR
DANGER IN PASSING IT WHY WITH SUCH A WONDERFUL ART AT HIS COMMAND
MCMURDO SHOULD CONDESCEND TO WORK AT ALL WAS A PERPETUAL MYSTERY TO
HIS COMPANIONS THOUGH HE MADE IT CLEAR TO ANYONE WHO ASKED HIM THAT
IF HE LIVED WITHOUT ANY VISIBLE MEANS IT WOULD VERY QUICKLY BRING THE
POLICE UPON HIS TRACK
ONE POLICEMAN WAS INDEED AFTER HIM ALREADY BUT THE INCIDENT AS LUCK
WOULD HAVE IT DID THE ADVENTURER A GREAT DEAL MORE GOOD THAN HARM
AFTER THE FIRST INTRODUCTION THERE WERE FEW EVENINGS WHEN HE DID NOT
FIND HIS WAY TO MCGINTYS SALOON THERE TO MAKE CLOSER ACQUAINTANCE
WITH THE BOYS WHICH WAS THE JOVIAL TITLE BY WHICH THE DANGEROUS
GANG WHO INFESTED THE PLACE WERE KNOWN TO ONE ANOTHER HIS DASHING
MANNER AND FEARLESSNESS OF SPEECH MADE HIM A FAVOURITE WITH THEM ALL
WHILE THE RAPID AND SCIENTIFIC WAY IN WHICH HE POLISHED OFF HIS
ANTAGONIST IN AN ALL IN BARROOM SCRAP EARNED THE RESPECT OF THAT
ROUGH COMMUNITY ANOTHER INCIDENT HOWEVER RAISED HIM EVEN HIGHER IN
THEIR ESTIMATION
JUST AT THE CROWDED HOUR ONE NIGHT THE DOOR OPENED AND A MAN ENTERED
WITH THE QUIET BLUE UNIFORM AND PEAKED CAP OF THE MINE POLICE THIS
WAS A SPECIAL BODY RAISED BY THE RAILWAYS AND COLLIERY OWNERS TO
SUPPLEMENT THE EFFORTS OF THE ORDINARY CIVIL POLICE WHO WERE
PERFECTLY HELPLESS IN THE FACE OF THE ORGANIZED RUFFIANISM WHICH
TERRORIZED THE DISTRICT THERE WAS A HUSH AS HE ENTERED AND MANY A
CURIOUS GLANCE WAS CAST AT HIM BUT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN POLICEMEN
AND CRIMINALS ARE PECULIAR IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATES AND MCGINTY
HIMSELF STANDING BEHIND HIS COUNTER SHOWED NO SURPRISE WHEN THE
POLICEMAN ENROLLED HIMSELF AMONG HIS CUSTOMERS
A STRAIGHT WHISKY FOR THE NIGHT IS BITTER SAID THE POLICE
OFFICER I DONT THINK WE HAVE MET BEFORE COUNCILLOR
YOULL BE THE NEW CAPTAIN SAID MCGINTY
THATS SO WERE LOOKING TO YOU COUNCILLOR AND TO THE OTHER
LEADING CITIZENS TO HELP US IN UPHOLDING LAW AND ORDER IN THIS
TOWNSHIP CAPTAIN MARVIN IS MY NAME
WED DO BETTER WITHOUT YOU CAPTAIN MARVIN SAID MCGINTY COLDLY
FOR WE HAVE OUR OWN POLICE OF THE TOWNSHIP AND NO NEED FOR ANY
IMPORTED GOODS WHAT ARE YOU BUT THE PAID TOOL OF THE CAPITALISTS
HIRED BY THEM TO CLUB OR SHOOT YOUR POORER FELLOW CITIZEN
WELL WELL WE WONT ARGUE ABOUT THAT SAID THE POLICE OFFICER
GOODHUMOUREDLY I EXPECT WE ALL DO OUR DUTY SAME AS WE SEE IT BUT
WE CANT ALL SEE IT THE SAME HE HAD DRUNK OFF HIS GLASS AND HAD
TURNED TO GO WHEN HIS EYES FELL UPON THE FACE OF JACK MCMURDO WHO
WAS SCOWLING AT HIS ELBOW HULLO HULLO HE CRIED LOOKING HIM UP
AND DOWN HERES AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE
MCMURDO SHRANK AWAY FROM HIM I WAS NEVER A FRIEND TO YOU NOR ANY
OTHER CURSED COPPER IN MY LIFE SAID HE
AN ACQUAINTANCE ISNT ALWAYS A FRIEND SAID THE POLICE CAPTAIN
GRINNING YOURE JACK MCMURDO OF CHICAGO RIGHT ENOUGH AND DONT
YOU DENY IT
MCMURDO SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IM NOT DENYING IT SAID HE DYE
THINK IM ASHAMED OF MY OWN NAME
YOUVE GOT GOOD CAUSE TO BE ANYHOW
WHAT THE DEVIL DYOU MEAN BY THAT HE ROARED WITH HIS FISTS
CLENCHED
NO NO JACK BLUSTER WONT DO WITH ME I WAS AN OFFICER IN CHICAGO
BEFORE EVER I CAME TO THIS DARNED COAL BUNKER AND I KNOW A CHICAGO
CROOK WHEN I SEE ONE
MCMURDOS FACE FELL DONT TELL ME THAT YOURE MARVIN OF THE CHICAGO
CENTRAL HE CRIED
JUST THE SAME OLD TEDDY MARVIN AT YOUR SERVICE WE HAVENT
FORGOTTEN THE SHOOTING OF JONAS PINTO UP THERE
I NEVER SHOT HIM
DID YOU NOT THATS GOOD IMPARTIAL EVIDENCE AINT IT WELL HIS
DEATH CAME IN UNCOMMON HANDY FOR YOU OR THEY WOULD HAVE HAD YOU FOR
SHOVING THE QUEER WELL WE CAN LET THAT BE BYGONES FOR BETWEEN YOU
AND MEAND PERHAPS IM GOING FURTHER THAN MY DUTY IN SAYING ITTHEY
COULD GET NO CLEAR CASE AGAINST YOU AND CHICAGOS OPEN TO YOU
TOMORROW
IM VERY WELL WHERE I AM
WELL IVE GIVEN YOU THE POINTER AND YOURE A SULKY DOG NOT TO
THANK ME FOR IT
WELL I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN WELL AND I DO THANK YOU SAID MCMURDO IN
NO VERY GRACIOUS MANNER
ITS MUM WITH ME SO LONG AS I SEE YOU LIVING ON THE STRAIGHT SAID
THE CAPTAIN BUT BY THE LORD IF YOU GET OFF AFTER THIS ITS
ANOTHER STORY SO GOODNIGHT TO YOUAND GOODNIGHT COUNCILLOR
HE LEFT THE BARROOM BUT NOT BEFORE HE HAD CREATED A LOCAL HERO
MCMURDOS DEEDS IN FAR CHICAGO HAD BEEN WHISPERED BEFORE HE HAD PUT
OFF ALL QUESTIONS WITH A SMILE AS ONE WHO DID NOT WISH TO HAVE
GREATNESS THRUST UPON HIM BUT NOW THE THING WAS OFFICIALLY
CONFIRMED THE BAR LOAFERS CROWDED ROUND HIM AND SHOOK HIM HEARTILY
BY THE HAND HE WAS FREE OF THE COMMUNITY FROM THAT TIME ON HE COULD
DRINK HARD AND SHOW LITTLE TRACE OF IT BUT THAT EVENING HAD HIS
MATE SCANLAN NOT BEEN AT HAND TO LEAD HIM HOME THE FETED HERO WOULD
SURELY HAVE SPENT HIS NIGHT UNDER THE BAR
ON A SATURDAY NIGHT MCMURDO WAS INTRODUCED TO THE LODGE HE HAD
THOUGHT TO PASS IN WITHOUT CEREMONY AS BEING AN INITIATE OF CHICAGO
BUT THERE WERE PARTICULAR RITES IN VERMISSA OF WHICH THEY WERE PROUD
AND THESE HAD TO BE UNDERGONE BY EVERY POSTULANT THE ASSEMBLY MET IN
A LARGE ROOM RESERVED FOR SUCH PURPOSES AT THE UNION HOUSE SOME
SIXTY MEMBERS ASSEMBLED AT VERMISSA BUT THAT BY NO MEANS REPRESENTED
THE FULL STRENGTH OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER
LODGES IN THE VALLEY AND OTHERS ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS ON EACH SIDE
WHO EXCHANGED MEMBERS WHEN ANY SERIOUS BUSINESS WAS AFOOT SO THAT A
CRIME MIGHT BE DONE BY MEN WHO WERE STRANGERS TO THE LOCALITY
ALTOGETHER THERE WERE NOT LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED SCATTERED OVER THE
COAL DISTRICT
IN THE BARE ASSEMBLY ROOM THE MEN WERE GATHERED ROUND A LONG TABLE
AT THE SIDE WAS A SECOND ONE LADEN WITH BOTTLES AND GLASSES ON WHICH
SOME MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY WERE ALREADY TURNING THEIR EYES MCGINTY
SAT AT THE HEAD WITH A FLAT BLACK VELVET CAP UPON HIS SHOCK OF
TANGLED BLACK HAIR AND A COLOURED PURPLE STOLE ROUND HIS NECK SO
THAT HE SEEMED TO BE A PRIEST PRESIDING OVER SOME DIABOLICAL RITUAL
TO RIGHT AND LEFT OF HIM WERE THE HIGHER LODGE OFFICIALS THE CRUEL
HANDSOME FACE OF TED BALDWIN AMONG THEM EACH OF THESE WORE SOME
SCARF OR MEDALLION AS EMBLEM OF HIS OFFICE
THEY WERE FOR THE MOST PART MEN OF MATURE AGE BUT THE REST OF THE
COMPANY CONSISTED OF YOUNG FELLOWS FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTYFIVE THE
READY AND CAPABLE AGENTS WHO CARRIED OUT THE COMMANDS OF THEIR
SENIORS AMONG THE OLDER MEN WERE MANY WHOSE FEATURES SHOWED THE
TIGERISH LAWLESS SOULS WITHIN BUT LOOKING AT THE RANK AND FILE IT
WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THESE EAGER AND OPENFACED YOUNG
FELLOWS WERE IN VERY TRUTH A DANGEROUS GANG OF MURDERERS WHOSE MINDS
HAD SUFFERED SUCH COMPLETE MORAL PERVERSION THAT THEY TOOK A HORRIBLE
PRIDE IN THEIR PROFICIENCY AT THE BUSINESS AND LOOKED WITH DEEPEST
RESPECT AT THE MAN WHO HAD THE REPUTATION OF MAKING WHAT THEY CALLED
A CLEAN JOB
TO THEIR CONTORTED NATURES IT HAD BECOME A SPIRITED AND CHIVALROUS
THING TO VOLUNTEER FOR SERVICE AGAINST SOME MAN WHO HAD NEVER INJURED
THEM AND WHOM IN MANY CASES THEY HAD NEVER SEEN IN THEIR LIVES THE
CRIME COMMITTED THEY QUARRELLED AS TO WHO HAD ACTUALLY STRUCK THE
FATAL BLOW AND AMUSED ONE ANOTHER AND THE COMPANY BY DESCRIBING THE
CRIES AND CONTORTIONS OF THE MURDERED MAN
AT FIRST THEY HAD SHOWN SOME SECRECY IN THEIR ARRANGEMENTS BUT AT
THE TIME WHICH THIS NARRATIVE DESCRIBES THEIR PROCEEDINGS WERE
EXTRAORDINARILY OPEN FOR THE REPEATED FAILURES OF THE LAW HAD PROVED
TO THEM THAT ON THE ONE HAND NO ONE WOULD DARE TO WITNESS AGAINST
THEM AND ON THE OTHER THEY HAD AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF STANCH
WITNESSES UPON WHOM THEY COULD CALL AND A WELLFILLED TREASURE CHEST
FROM WHICH THEY COULD DRAW THE FUNDS TO ENGAGE THE BEST LEGAL TALENT
IN THE STATE IN TEN LONG YEARS OF OUTRAGE THERE HAD BEEN NO SINGLE
CONVICTION AND THE ONLY DANGER THAT EVER THREATENED THE SCOWRERS LAY
IN THE VICTIM HIMSELFWHO HOWEVER OUTNUMBERED AND TAKEN BY
SURPRISE MIGHT AND OCCASIONALLY DID LEAVE HIS MARK UPON HIS
ASSAILANTS
MCMURDO HAD BEEN WARNED THAT SOME ORDEAL LAY BEFORE HIM BUT NO ONE
WOULD TELL HIM IN WHAT IT CONSISTED HE WAS LED NOW INTO AN OUTER
ROOM BY TWO SOLEMN BROTHERS THROUGH THE PLANK PARTITION HE COULD
HEAR THE MURMUR OF MANY VOICES FROM THE ASSEMBLY WITHIN ONCE OR
TWICE HE CAUGHT THE SOUND OF HIS OWN NAME AND HE KNEW THAT THEY WERE
DISCUSSING HIS CANDIDACY THEN THERE ENTERED AN INNER GUARD WITH A
GREEN AND GOLD SASH ACROSS HIS CHEST
THE BODYMASTER ORDERS THAT HE SHALL BE TRUSSED BLINDED AND
ENTERED SAID HE
THE THREE OF THEM REMOVED HIS COAT TURNED UP THE SLEEVE OF HIS RIGHT
ARM AND FINALLY PASSED A ROPE ROUND ABOVE THE ELBOWS AND MADE IT
FAST THEY NEXT PLACED A THICK BLACK CAP RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD AND THE
UPPER PART OF HIS FACE SO THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING HE WAS THEN LED
INTO THE ASSEMBLY HALL
IT WAS PITCH DARK AND VERY OPPRESSIVE UNDER HIS HOOD HE HEARD THE
RUSTLE AND MURMUR OF THE PEOPLE ROUND HIM AND THEN THE VOICE OF
MCGINTY SOUNDED DULL AND DISTANT THROUGH THE COVERING OF HIS EARS
JOHN MCMURDO SAID THE VOICE ARE YOU ALREADY A MEMBER OF THE
ANCIENT ORDER OF FREEMEN
HE BOWED IN ASSENT
IS YOUR LODGE NO CHICAGO
HE BOWED AGAIN
DARK NIGHTS ARE UNPLEASANT SAID THE VOICE
YES FOR STRANGERS TO TRAVEL HE ANSWERED
THE CLOUDS ARE HEAVY
YES A STORM IS APPROACHING
ARE THE BRETHREN SATISFIED ASKED THE BODYMASTER
THERE WAS A GENERAL MURMUR OF ASSENT
WE KNOW BROTHER BY YOUR SIGN AND BY YOUR COUNTERSIGN THAT YOU ARE
INDEED ONE OF US SAID MCGINTY WE WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW HOWEVER
THAT IN THIS COUNTY AND IN OTHER COUNTIES OF THESE PARTS WE HAVE
CERTAIN RITES AND ALSO CERTAIN DUTIES OF OUR OWN WHICH CALL FOR GOOD
MEN ARE YOU READY TO BE TESTED
I AM
ARE YOU OF STOUT HEART
I AM
TAKE A STRIDE FORWARD TO PROVE IT
AS THE WORDS WERE SAID HE FELT TWO HARD POINTS IN FRONT OF HIS EYES
PRESSING UPON THEM SO THAT IT APPEARED AS IF HE COULD NOT MOVE
FORWARD WITHOUT A DANGER OF LOSING THEM NONE THE LESS HE NERVED
HIMSELF TO STEP RESOLUTELY OUT AND AS HE DID SO THE PRESSURE MELTED
AWAY THERE WAS A LOW MURMUR OF APPLAUSE
HE IS OF STOUT HEART SAID THE VOICE CAN YOU BEAR PAIN
AS WELL AS ANOTHER HE ANSWERED
TEST HIM
IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO TO KEEP HIMSELF FROM SCREAMING OUT FOR AN
AGONIZING PAIN SHOT THROUGH HIS FOREARM HE NEARLY FAINTED AT THE
SUDDEN SHOCK OF IT BUT HE BIT HIS LIP AND CLENCHED HIS HANDS TO HIDE
HIS AGONY
I CAN TAKE MORE THAN THAT SAID HE
THIS TIME THERE WAS LOUD APPLAUSE A FINER FIRST APPEARANCE HAD NEVER
BEEN MADE IN THE LODGE HANDS CLAPPED HIM ON THE BACK AND THE HOOD
WAS PLUCKED FROM HIS HEAD HE STOOD BLINKING AND SMILING AMID THE
CONGRATULATIONS OF THE BROTHERS
ONE LAST WORD BROTHER MCMURDO SAID MCGINTY YOU HAVE ALREADY
SWORN THE OATH OF SECRECY AND FIDELITY AND YOU ARE AWARE THAT THE
PUNISHMENT FOR ANY BREACH OF IT IS INSTANT AND INEVITABLE DEATH
I AM SAID MCMURDO
AND YOU ACCEPT THE RULE OF THE BODYMASTER FOR THE TIME BEING UNDER
ALL CIRCUMSTANCES
I DO
THEN IN THE NAME OF LODGE VERMISSA I WELCOME YOU TO ITS
PRIVILEGES AND DEBATES YOU WILL PUT THE LIQUOR ON THE TABLE BROTHER
SCANLAN AND WE WILL DRINK TO OUR WORTHY BROTHER
MCMURDOS COAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO HIM BUT BEFORE PUTTING IT ON HE
EXAMINED HIS RIGHT ARM WHICH STILL SMARTED HEAVILY THERE ON THE
FLESH OF THE FOREARM WAS A CIRCLE WITH A TRIANGLE WITHIN IT DEEP AND
RED AS THE BRANDING IRON HAD LEFT IT ONE OR TWO OF HIS NEIGHBOURS
PULLED UP THEIR SLEEVES AND SHOWED THEIR OWN LODGE MARKS
WEVE ALL HAD IT SAID ONE BUT NOT ALL AS BRAVE AS YOU OVER IT
TUT IT WAS NOTHING SAID HE BUT IT BURNED AND ACHED ALL THE SAME
WHEN THE DRINKS WHICH FOLLOWED THE CEREMONY OF INITIATION HAD ALL
BEEN DISPOSED OF THE BUSINESS OF THE LODGE PROCEEDED MCMURDO
ACCUSTOMED ONLY TO THE PROSAIC PERFORMANCES OF CHICAGO LISTENED WITH
OPEN EARS AND MORE SURPRISE THAN HE VENTURED TO SHOW TO WHAT
FOLLOWED
THE FIRST BUSINESS ON THE AGENDA PAPER SAID MCGINTY IS TO READ
THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM DIVISION MASTER WINDLE OF MERTON COUNTY
LODGE HE SAYS

J W WINDLE D M A O F
WINDLE HAS NEVER REFUSED US WHEN WE HAVE HAD OCCASION TO ASK FOR THE
LOAN OF A MAN OR TWO AND IT IS NOT FOR US TO REFUSE HIM MCGINTY
PAUSED AND LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM WITH HIS DULL MALEVOLENT EYES WHO
WILL VOLUNTEER FOR THE JOB
SEVERAL YOUNG FELLOWS HELD UP THEIR HANDS THE BODYMASTER LOOKED AT
THEM WITH AN APPROVING SMILE
YOULL DO TIGER CORMAC IF YOU HANDLE IT AS WELL AS YOU DID THE
LAST YOU WONT BE WRONG AND YOU WILSON

OF TIGER
NEVER MIND THE REWARD YOU JUST DO IT FOR THE HONOUR OF THE THING

OF THE BOX
WHAT HAS THE MAN DONE ASKED YOUNG WILSON

HAS BEEN JUDGED OVER THERE THATS NO BUSINESS OF OURS ALL WE HAVE
TO DO IS TO CARRY IT OUT FOR THEM SAME AS THEY WOULD FOR US
SPEAKING OF THAT TWO BROTHERS FROM THE MERTON LODGE ARE COMING OVER
TO US NEXT WEEK TO DO SOME BUSINESS IN THIS QUARTER
WHO ARE THEY ASKED SOMEONE
FAITH IT IS WISER NOT TO ASK IF YOU KNOW NOTHING YOU CAN TESTIFY
NOTHING AND NO TROUBLE CAN COME OF IT BUT THEY ARE MEN WHO WILL
MAKE A CLEAN JOB WHEN THEY ARE ABOUT IT
AND TIME TOO CRIED TED BALDWIN FOLK ARE GETTIN OUT OF HAND IN
THESE PARTS IT WAS ONLY LAST WEEK THAT THREE OF OUR MEN WERE TURNED
OFF BY FOREMAN BLAKER ITS BEEN OWING HIM A LONG TIME AND HELL GET
IT FULL AND PROPER
GET WHAT MCMURDO WHISPERED TO HIS NEIGHBOUR
THE BUSINESS END OF A BUCKSHOT CARTRIDGE CRIED THE MAN WITH A LOUD
LAUGH WHAT THINK YOU OF OUR WAYS BROTHER
MCMURDOS CRIMINAL SOUL SEEMED TO HAVE ALREADY ABSORBED THE SPIRIT OF
THE VILE ASSOCIATION OF WHICH HE WAS NOW A MEMBER I LIKE IT WELL
SAID HE TIS A PROPER PLACE FOR A LAD OF METTLE
SEVERAL OF THOSE WHO SAT AROUND HEARD HIS WORDS AND APPLAUDED THEM
WHATS THAT CRIED THE BLACKMANED BODYMASTER FROM THE END OF THE
TABLE
TIS OUR NEW BROTHER SIR WHO FINDS OUR WAYS TO HIS TASTE
MCMURDO ROSE TO HIS FEET FOR AN INSTANT I WOULD SAY EMINENT
BODYMASTER THAT IF A MAN SHOULD BE WANTED I SHOULD TAKE IT AS AN
HONOUR TO BE CHOSEN TO HELP THE LODGE
THERE WAS GREAT APPLAUSE AT THIS IT WAS FELT THAT A NEW SUN WAS
PUSHING ITS RIM ABOVE THE HORIZON TO SOME OF THE ELDERS IT SEEMED
THAT THE PROGRESS WAS A LITTLE TOO RAPID
I WOULD MOVE SAID THE SECRETARY HARRAWAY A VULTUREFACED OLD
GRAYBEARD WHO SAT NEAR THE CHAIRMAN THAT BROTHER MCMURDO SHOULD
WAIT UNTIL IT IS THE GOOD PLEASURE OF THE LODGE TO EMPLOY HIM
SURE THAT WAS WHAT I MEANT IM IN YOUR HANDS SAID MCMURDO
YOUR TIME WILL COME BROTHER SAID THE CHAIRMAN WE HAVE MARKED
YOU DOWN AS A WILLING MAN AND WE BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL DO GOOD WORK
IN THESE PARTS THERE IS A SMALL MATTER TONIGHT IN WHICH YOU MAY
TAKE A HAND IF IT SO PLEASE YOU
I WILL WAIT FOR SOMETHING THAT IS WORTH WHILE
YOU CAN COME TONIGHT ANYHOW AND IT WILL HELP YOU TO KNOW WHAT WE
STAND FOR IN THIS COMMUNITY I WILL MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT LATER
MEANWHILE HE GLANCED AT HIS AGENDA PAPER I HAVE ONE OR TWO MORE
POINTS TO BRING BEFORE THE MEETING FIRST OF ALL I WILL ASK THE
TREASURER AS TO OUR BANK BALANCE THERE IS THE PENSION TO JIM
CARNAWAYS WIDOW HE WAS STRUCK DOWN DOING THE WORK OF THE LODGE AND
IT IS FOR US TO SEE THAT SHE IS NOT THE LOSER
JIM WAS SHOT LAST MONTH WHEN THEY TRIED TO KILL CHESTER WILCOX OF
MARLEY CREEK MCMURDOS NEIGHBOUR INFORMED HIM
THE FUNDS ARE GOOD AT THE MOMENT SAID THE TREASURER WITH THE
BANKBOOK IN FRONT OF HIM THE FIRMS HAVE BEEN GENEROUS OF LATE MAX
LINDER CO PAID FIVE HUNDRED TO BE LEFT ALONE WALKER BROTHERS SENT
IN A HUNDRED BUT I TOOK IT ON MYSELF TO RETURN IT AND ASK FOR FIVE
IF I DO NOT HEAR BY WEDNESDAY THEIR WINDING GEAR MAY GET OUT OF
ORDER WE HAD TO BURN THEIR BREAKER LAST YEAR BEFORE THEY BECAME
REASONABLE THEN THE WEST SECTION COALING COMPANY HAS PAID ITS ANNUAL
CONTRIBUTION WE HAVE ENOUGH ON HAND TO MEET ANY OBLIGATIONS
WHAT ABOUT ARCHIE SWINDON ASKED A BROTHER
HE HAS SOLD OUT AND LEFT THE DISTRICT THE OLD DEVIL LEFT A NOTE FOR
US TO SAY THAT HE HAD RATHER BE A FREE CROSSING SWEEPER IN NEW YORK
THAN A LARGE MINE OWNER UNDER THE POWER OF A RING OF BLACKMAILERS BY
GAR IT WAS AS WELL THAT HE MADE A BREAK FOR IT BEFORE THE NOTE
REACHED US I GUESS HE WONT SHOW HIS FACE IN THIS VALLEY AGAIN
AN ELDERLY CLEANSHAVED MAN WITH A KINDLY FACE AND A GOOD BROW ROSE
FROM THE END OF THE TABLE WHICH FACED THE CHAIRMAN MR TREASURER
HE ASKED MAY I ASK WHO HAS BOUGHT THE PROPERTY OF THIS MAN THAT WE
HAVE DRIVEN OUT OF THE DISTRICT
YES BROTHER MORRIS IT HAS BEEN BOUGHT BY THE STATE MERTON COUNTY
RAILROAD COMPANY
AND WHO BOUGHT THE MINES OF TODMAN AND OF LEE THAT CAME INTO THE
MARKET IN THE SAME WAY LAST YEAR
THE SAME COMPANY BROTHER MORRIS
AND WHO BOUGHT THE IRONWORKS OF MANSON AND OF SHUMAN AND OF VAN
DEHER AND OF ATWOOD WHICH HAVE ALL BEEN GIVEN UP OF LATE
THEY WERE ALL BOUGHT BY THE WEST GILMERTON GENERAL MINING COMPANY
I DONT SEE BROTHER MORRIS SAID THE CHAIRMAN THAT IT MATTERS TO
US WHO BUYS THEM SINCE THEY CANT CARRY THEM OUT OF THE DISTRICT
WITH ALL RESPECT TO YOU EMINENT BODYMASTER I THINK IT MAY MATTER
VERY MUCH TO US THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN GOING ON NOW FOR TEN LONG
YEARS WE ARE GRADUALLY DRIVING ALL THE SMALL MEN OUT OF TRADE WHAT
IS THE RESULT WE FIND IN THEIR PLACES GREAT COMPANIES LIKE THE
RAILROAD OR THE GENERAL IRON WHO HAVE THEIR DIRECTORS IN NEW YORK OR
PHILADELPHIA AND CARE NOTHING FOR OUR THREATS WE CAN TAKE IT OUT OF
THEIR LOCAL BOSSES BUT IT ONLY MEANS THAT OTHERS WILL BE SENT IN
THEIR STEAD AND WE ARE MAKING IT DANGEROUS FOR OURSELVES THE SMALL
MEN COULD NOT HARM US THEY HAD NOT THE MONEY NOR THE POWER SO LONG
AS WE DID NOT SQUEEZE THEM TOO DRY THEY WOULD STAY ON UNDER OUR
POWER BUT IF THESE BIG COMPANIES FIND THAT WE STAND BETWEEN THEM AND
THEIR PROFITS THEY WILL SPARE NO PAINS AND NO EXPENSE TO HUNT US
DOWN AND BRING US TO COURT
THERE WAS A HUSH AT THESE OMINOUS WORDS AND EVERY FACE DARKENED AS
GLOOMY LOOKS WERE EXCHANGED SO OMNIPOTENT AND UNCHALLENGED HAD THEY
BEEN THAT THE VERY THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS POSSIBLE RETRIBUTION IN THE
BACKGROUND HAD BEEN BANISHED FROM THEIR MINDS AND YET THE IDEA
STRUCK A CHILL TO THE MOST RECKLESS OF THEM
IT IS MY ADVICE THE SPEAKER CONTINUED THAT WE GO EASIER UPON THE
SMALL MEN ON THE DAY THAT THEY HAVE ALL BEEN DRIVEN OUT THE POWER OF
THIS SOCIETY WILL HAVE BEEN BROKEN
UNWELCOME TRUTHS ARE NOT POPULAR THERE WERE ANGRY CRIES AS THE
SPEAKER RESUMED HIS SEAT MCGINTY ROSE WITH GLOOM UPON HIS BROW
BROTHER MORRIS SAID HE YOU WERE ALWAYS A CROAKER SO LONG AS THE
MEMBERS OF THIS LODGE STAND TOGETHER THERE IS NO POWER IN THE UNITED
STATES THAT CAN TOUCH THEM SURE HAVE WE NOT TRIED IT OFTEN ENOUGH
IN THE LAW COURTS I EXPECT THE BIG COMPANIES WILL FIND IT EASIER TO
PAY THAN TO FIGHT SAME AS THE LITTLE COMPANIES DO AND NOW
BRETHREN MCGINTY TOOK OFF HIS BLACK VELVET CAP AND HIS STOLE AS HE
SPOKE THIS LODGE HAS FINISHED ITS BUSINESS FOR THE EVENING SAVE
FOR ONE SMALL MATTER WHICH MAY BE MENTIONED WHEN WE ARE PARTING THE
TIME HAS NOW COME FOR FRATERNAL REFRESHMENT AND FOR HARMONY
STRANGE INDEED IS HUMAN NATURE HERE WERE THESE MEN TO WHOM MURDER
WAS FAMILIAR WHO AGAIN AND AGAIN HAD STRUCK DOWN THE FATHER OF THE
FAMILY SOME MAN AGAINST WHOM THEY HAD NO PERSONAL FEELING WITHOUT
ONE THOUGHT OF COMPUNCTION OR OF COMPASSION FOR HIS WEEPING WIFE OR
HELPLESS CHILDREN AND YET THE TENDER OR PATHETIC IN MUSIC COULD MOVE
THEM TO TEARS MCMURDO HAD A FINE TENOR VOICE AND IF HE HAD FAILED
TO GAIN THE GOOD WILL OF THE LODGE BEFORE IT COULD NO LONGER HAVE
BEEN WITHHELD AFTER HE HAD THRILLED THEM WITH IM SITTING ON THE
STILE MARY AND ON THE BANKS OF ALLAN WATER
IN HIS VERY FIRST NIGHT THE NEW RECRUIT HAD MADE HIMSELF ONE OF THE
MOST POPULAR OF THE BRETHREN MARKED ALREADY FOR ADVANCEMENT AND HIGH
OFFICE THERE WERE OTHER QUALITIES NEEDED HOWEVER BESIDES THOSE OF
GOOD FELLOWSHIP TO MAKE A WORTHY FREEMAN AND OF THESE HE WAS GIVEN
AN EXAMPLE BEFORE THE EVENING WAS OVER THE WHISKY BOTTLE HAD PASSED
ROUND MANY TIMES AND THE MEN WERE FLUSHED AND RIPE FOR MISCHIEF WHEN
THEIR BODYMASTER ROSE ONCE MORE TO ADDRESS THEM
BOYS SAID HE THERES ONE MAN IN THIS TOWN THAT WANTS TRIMMING
UP AND ITS FOR YOU TO SEE THAT HE GETS IT IM SPEAKING OF JAMES
STANGER OF THE HERALD YOUVE SEEN HOW HES BEEN OPENING HIS MOUTH
AGAINST US AGAIN
THERE WAS A MURMUR OF ASSENT WITH MANY A MUTTERED OATH MCGINTY TOOK
A SLIP OF PAPER FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET
LAW AND ORDER
THATS HOW HE HEADS IT
REIGN OF TERROR IN THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICT
TWELVE YEARS HAVE NOW ELAPSED SINCE THE FIRST ASSASSINATIONS WHICH
PROVED THE EXISTENCE OF A CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION IN OUR MIDST FROM
THAT DAY THESE OUTRAGES HAVE NEVER CEASED UNTIL NOW THEY HAVE
REACHED A PITCH WHICH MAKES US THE OPPROBRIUM OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD
IS IT FOR SUCH RESULTS AS THIS THAT OUR GREAT COUNTRY WELCOMES TO ITS
BOSOM THE ALIEN WHO FLIES FROM THE DESPOTISMS OF EUROPE IS IT THAT
THEY SHALL THEMSELVES BECOME TYRANTS OVER THE VERY MEN WHO HAVE GIVEN
THEM SHELTER AND THAT A STATE OF TERRORISM AND LAWLESSNESS SHOULD BE
ESTABLISHED UNDER THE VERY SHADOW OF THE SACRED FOLDS OF THE STARRY
FLAG OF FREEDOM WHICH WOULD RAISE HORROR IN OUR MINDS IF WE READ OF
IT AS EXISTING UNDER THE MOST EFFETE MONARCHY OF THE EAST THE MEN
ARE KNOWN THE ORGANIZATION IS PATENT AND PUBLIC HOW LONG ARE WE TO
ENDURE IT CAN WE FOREVER LIVE
SURE IVE READ ENOUGH OF THE SLUSH CRIED THE CHAIRMAN TOSSING THE
PAPER DOWN UPON THE TABLE THATS WHAT HE SAYS OF US THE QUESTION
IM ASKING YOU IS WHAT SHALL WE SAY TO HIM
KILL HIM CRIED A DOZEN FIERCE VOICES
I PROTEST AGAINST THAT SAID BROTHER MORRIS THE MAN OF THE GOOD
BROW AND SHAVED FACE I TELL YOU BRETHREN THAT OUR HAND IS TOO
HEAVY IN THIS VALLEY AND THAT THERE WILL COME A POINT WHERE IN
SELFDEFENSE EVERY MAN WILL UNITE TO CRUSH US OUT JAMES STANGER IS
AN OLD MAN HE IS RESPECTED IN THE TOWNSHIP AND THE DISTRICT HIS
PAPER STANDS FOR ALL THAT IS SOLID IN THE VALLEY IF THAT MAN IS
STRUCK DOWN THERE WILL BE A STIR THROUGH THIS STATE THAT WILL ONLY
END WITH OUR DESTRUCTION
AND HOW WOULD THEY BRING ABOUT OUR DESTRUCTION MR STANDBACK
CRIED MCGINTY IS IT BY THE POLICE SURE HALF OF THEM ARE IN OUR
PAY AND HALF OF THEM AFRAID OF US OR IS IT BY THE LAW COURTS AND THE
JUDGE HAVENT WE TRIED THAT BEFORE NOW AND WHAT EVER CAME OF IT
THERE IS A JUDGE LYNCH THAT MIGHT TRY THE CASE SAID BROTHER
MORRIS
A GENERAL SHOUT OF ANGER GREETED THE SUGGESTION
I HAVE BUT TO RAISE MY FINGER CRIED MCGINTY AND I COULD PUT TWO
HUNDRED MEN INTO THIS TOWN THAT WOULD CLEAR IT OUT FROM END TO END
THEN SUDDENLY RAISING HIS VOICE AND BENDING HIS HUGE BLACK BROWS INTO
A TERRIBLE FROWN SEE HERE BROTHER MORRIS I HAVE MY EYE ON YOU
AND HAVE HAD FOR SOME TIME YOUVE NO HEART YOURSELF AND YOU TRY TO
TAKE THE HEART OUT OF OTHERS IT WILL BE AN ILL DAY FOR YOU BROTHER
MORRIS WHEN YOUR OWN NAME COMES ON OUR AGENDA PAPER AND IM
THINKING THAT ITS JUST THERE THAT I OUGHT TO PLACE IT
MORRIS HAD TURNED DEADLY PALE AND HIS KNEES SEEMED TO GIVE WAY UNDER
HIM AS HE FELL BACK INTO HIS CHAIR HE RAISED HIS GLASS IN HIS
TREMBLING HAND AND DRANK BEFORE HE COULD ANSWER I APOLOGIZE
EMINENT BODYMASTER TO YOU AND TO EVERY BROTHER IN THIS LODGE IF I
HAVE SAID MORE THAN I SHOULD I AM A FAITHFUL MEMBERYOU ALL KNOW
THATAND IT IS MY FEAR LEST EVIL COME TO THE LODGE WHICH MAKES ME
SPEAK IN ANXIOUS WORDS BUT I HAVE GREATER TRUST IN YOUR JUDGMENT
THAN IN MY OWN EMINENT BODYMASTER AND I PROMISE YOU THAT I WILL NOT
OFFEND AGAIN
THE BODYMASTERS SCOWL RELAXED AS HE LISTENED TO THE HUMBLE WORDS
VERY GOOD BROTHER MORRIS ITS MYSELF THAT WOULD BE SORRY IF IT
WERE NEEDFUL TO GIVE YOU A LESSON BUT SO LONG AS I AM IN THIS CHAIR
WE SHALL BE A UNITED LODGE IN WORD AND IN DEED AND NOW BOYS HE
CONTINUED LOOKING ROUND AT THE COMPANY ILL SAY THIS MUCH THAT IF
STANGER GOT HIS FULL DESERTS THERE WOULD BE MORE TROUBLE THAN WE NEED
ASK FOR THESE EDITORS HANG TOGETHER AND EVERY JOURNAL IN THE STATE
WOULD BE CRYING OUT FOR POLICE AND TROOPS BUT I GUESS YOU CAN GIVE
HIM A PRETTY SEVERE WARNING WILL YOU FIX IT BROTHER BALDWIN

HOW MANY WILL YOU TAKE
HALF A DOZEN AND TWO TO GUARD THE DOOR YOULL COME GOWER AND
YOU MANSEL AND YOU SCANLAN AND THE TWO WILLABYS
I PROMISED THE NEW BROTHER HE SHOULD GO SAID THE CHAIRMAN
TED BALDWIN LOOKED AT MCMURDO WITH EYES WHICH SHOWED THAT HE HAD NOT
FORGOTTEN NOR FORGIVEN WELL HE CAN COME IF HE WANTS HE SAID IN A
SURLY VOICE THATS ENOUGH THE SOONER WE GET TO WORK THE BETTER
THE COMPANY BROKE UP WITH SHOUTS AND YELLS AND SNATCHES OF DRUNKEN
SONG THE BAR WAS STILL CROWDED WITH REVELLERS AND MANY OF THE
BRETHREN REMAINED THERE THE LITTLE BAND WHO HAD BEEN TOLD OFF FOR
DUTY PASSED OUT INTO THE STREET PROCEEDING IN TWOS AND THREES ALONG
THE SIDEWALK SO AS NOT TO PROVOKE ATTENTION IT WAS A BITTERLY COLD
NIGHT WITH A HALFMOON SHINING BRILLIANTLY IN A FROSTY
STARSPANGLED SKY THE MEN STOPPED AND GATHERED IN A YARD WHICH FACED
A HIGH BUILDING THE WORDS VERMISSA HERALD WERE PRINTED IN GOLD
LETTERING BETWEEN THE BRIGHTLY LIT WINDOWS FROM WITHIN CAME THE
CLANKING OF THE PRINTING PRESS
HERE YOU SAID BALDWIN TO MCMURDO YOU CAN STAND BELOW AT THE
DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROAD IS KEPT OPEN FOR US ARTHUR WILLABY CAN
STAY WITH YOU YOU OTHERS COME WITH ME HAVE NO FEARS BOYS FOR WE
HAVE A DOZEN WITNESSES THAT WE ARE IN THE UNION BAR AT THIS VERY
MOMENT

TWO REVELLERS UPON THEIR WAY HOME THE PARTY CROSSED THE ROAD AND
PUSHING OPEN THE DOOR OF THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE BALDWIN AND HIS MEN
RUSHED IN AND UP THE STAIR WHICH FACED THEM MCMURDO AND ANOTHER
REMAINED BELOW FROM THE ROOM ABOVE CAME A SHOUT A CRY FOR HELP AND
THEN THE SOUND OF TRAMPLING FEET AND OF FALLING CHAIRS AN INSTANT
LATER A GRAYHAIRED MAN RUSHED OUT ON THE LANDING
HE WAS SEIZED BEFORE HE COULD GET FARTHER AND HIS SPECTACLES CAME
TINKLING DOWN TO MCMURDOS FEET THERE WAS A THUD AND A GROAN HE WAS
ON HIS FACE AND HALF A DOZEN STICKS WERE CLATTERING TOGETHER AS THEY
FELL UPON HIM HE WRITHED AND HIS LONG THIN LIMBS QUIVERED UNDER
THE BLOWS THE OTHERS CEASED AT LAST BUT BALDWIN HIS CRUEL FACE SET
IN AN INFERNAL SMILE WAS HACKING AT THE MANS HEAD WHICH HE VAINLY
ENDEAVOURED TO DEFEND WITH HIS ARMS HIS WHITE HAIR WAS DABBLED WITH
PATCHES OF BLOOD BALDWIN WAS STILL STOOPING OVER HIS VICTIM PUTTING
IN A SHORT VICIOUS BLOW WHENEVER HE COULD SEE A PART EXPOSED WHEN
MCMURDO DASHED UP THE STAIR AND PUSHED HIM BACK
YOULL KILL THE MAN SAID HE DROP IT
BALDWIN LOOKED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT CURSE YOU HE CRIED WHO ARE
YOU TO INTERFEREYOU THAT ARE NEW TO THE LODGE STAND BACK HE
RAISED HIS STICK BUT MCMURDO HAD WHIPPED HIS PISTOL OUT OF HIS HIP
POCKET
STAND BACK YOURSELF HE CRIED ILL BLOW YOUR FACE IN IF YOU LAY A
HAND ON ME AS TO THE LODGE WASNT IT THE ORDER OF THE BODYMASTER
THAT THE MAN WAS NOT TO BE KILLEDAND WHAT ARE YOU DOING BUT KILLING
HIM
ITS TRUTH HE SAYS REMARKED ONE OF THE MEN
BY GAR YOUD BEST HURRY YOURSELVES CRIED THE MAN BELOW THE
WINDOWS ARE ALL LIGHTING UP AND YOULL HAVE THE WHOLE TOWN HERE
INSIDE OF FIVE MINUTES
THERE WAS INDEED THE SOUND OF SHOUTING IN THE STREET AND A LITTLE
GROUP OF COMPOSITORS AND PRESSMEN WAS FORMING IN THE HALL BELOW AND
NERVING ITSELF TO ACTION LEAVING THE LIMP AND MOTIONLESS BODY OF THE
EDITOR AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIR THE CRIMINALS RUSHED DOWN AND MADE
THEIR WAY SWIFTLY ALONG THE STREET HAVING REACHED THE UNION HOUSE
SOME OF THEM MIXED WITH THE CROWD IN MCGINTYS SALOON WHISPERING
ACROSS THE BAR TO THE BOSS THAT THE JOB HAD BEEN WELL CARRIED
THROUGH OTHERS AND AMONG THEM MCMURDO BROKE AWAY INTO SIDE
STREETS AND SO BY DEVIOUS PATHS TO THEIR OWN HOMES
CHAPTER IV
THE VALLEY OF FEAR
WHEN MCMURDO AWOKE NEXT MORNING HE HAD GOOD REASON TO REMEMBER HIS
INITIATION INTO THE LODGE HIS HEAD ACHED WITH THE EFFECT OF THE
DRINK AND HIS ARM WHERE HE HAD BEEN BRANDED WAS HOT AND SWOLLEN
HAVING HIS OWN PECULIAR SOURCE OF INCOME HE WAS IRREGULAR IN HIS
ATTENDANCE AT HIS WORK SO HE HAD A LATE BREAKFAST AND REMAINED AT
HOME FOR THE MORNING WRITING A LONG LETTER TO A FRIEND AFTERWARDS HE
READ THE DAILY HERALD IN A SPECIAL COLUMN PUT IN AT THE LAST MOMENT
HE READ
OUTRAGE AT THE HERALD OFFICE EDITOR SERIOUSLY INJURED
IT WAS A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS WITH WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF MORE
FAMILIAR THAN THE WRITER COULD HAVE BEEN IT ENDED WITH THE
STATEMENT
THE MATTER IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE POLICE BUT IT CAN HARDLY BE
HOPED THAT THEIR EXERTIONS WILL BE ATTENDED BY ANY BETTER RESULTS
THAN IN THE PAST SOME OF THE MEN WERE RECOGNIZED AND THERE IS HOPE
THAT A CONVICTION MAY BE OBTAINED THE SOURCE OF THE OUTRAGE WAS IT
NEED HARDLY BE SAID THAT INFAMOUS SOCIETY WHICH HAS HELD THIS
COMMUNITY IN BONDAGE FOR SO LONG A PERIOD AND AGAINST WHICH THE
HERALD HAS TAKEN SO UNCOMPROMISING A STAND MR STANGERS MANY
FRIENDS WILL REJOICE TO HEAR THAT THOUGH HE HAS BEEN CRUELLY AND
BRUTALLY BEATEN AND THOUGH HE HAS SUSTAINED SEVERE INJURIES ABOUT
THE HEAD THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE DANGER TO HIS LIFE
BELOW IT STATED THAT A GUARD OF POLICE ARMED WITH WINCHESTER RIFLES
HAD BEEN REQUISITIONED FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE OFFICE
MCMURDO HAD LAID DOWN THE PAPER AND WAS LIGHTING HIS PIPE WITH A
HAND WHICH WAS SHAKY FROM THE EXCESSES OF THE PREVIOUS EVENING WHEN
THERE WAS A KNOCK OUTSIDE AND HIS LANDLADY BROUGHT TO HIM A NOTE
WHICH HAD JUST BEEN HANDED IN BY A LAD IT WAS UNSIGNED AND RAN
THUS
I SHOULD WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU BUT WOULD RATHER NOT DO SO IN YOUR
HOUSE YOU WILL FIND ME BESIDE THE FLAGSTAFF UPON MILLER HILL IF YOU
WILL COME THERE NOW I HAVE SOMETHING WHICH IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU
TO HEAR AND FOR ME TO SAY
MCMURDO READ THE NOTE TWICE WITH THE UTMOST SURPRISE FOR HE COULD
NOT IMAGINE WHAT IT MEANT OR WHO WAS THE AUTHOR OF IT HAD IT BEEN IN
A FEMININE HAND HE MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED THAT IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF
ONE OF THOSE ADVENTURES WHICH HAD BEEN FAMILIAR ENOUGH IN HIS PAST
LIFE BUT IT WAS THE WRITING OF A MAN AND OF A WELL EDUCATED ONE
TOO FINALLY AFTER SOME HESITATION HE DETERMINED TO SEE THE MATTER
THROUGH
MILLER HILL IS AN ILLKEPT PUBLIC PARK IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THE
TOWN IN SUMMER IT IS A FAVOURITE RESORT OF THE PEOPLE BUT IN WINTER
IT IS DESOLATE ENOUGH FROM THE TOP OF IT ONE HAS A VIEW NOT ONLY OF
THE WHOLE STRAGGLING GRIMY TOWN BUT OF THE WINDING VALLEY BENEATH
WITH ITS SCATTERED MINES AND FACTORIES BLACKENING THE SNOW ON EACH
SIDE OF IT AND OF THE WOODED AND WHITECAPPED RANGES FLANKING IT
MCMURDO STROLLED UP THE WINDING PATH HEDGED IN WITH EVERGREENS UNTIL
HE REACHED THE DESERTED RESTAURANT WHICH FORMS THE CENTRE OF SUMMER
GAIETY BESIDE IT WAS A BARE FLAGSTAFF AND UNDERNEATH IT A MAN HIS
HAT DRAWN DOWN AND THE COLLAR OF HIS OVERCOAT TURNED UP WHEN HE
TURNED HIS FACE MCMURDO SAW THAT IT WAS BROTHER MORRIS HE WHO HAD
INCURRED THE ANGER OF THE BODYMASTER THE NIGHT BEFORE THE LODGE SIGN
WAS GIVEN AND EXCHANGED AS THEY MET
I WANTED TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU MR MCMURDO SAID THE OLDER MAN
SPEAKING WITH A HESITATION WHICH SHOWED THAT HE WAS ON DELICATE
GROUND IT WAS KIND OF YOU TO COME
WHY DID YOU NOT PUT YOUR NAME TO THE NOTE
ONE HAS TO BE CAUTIOUS MISTER ONE NEVER KNOWS IN TIMES LIKE THESE
HOW A THING MAY COME BACK TO ONE ONE NEVER KNOWS EITHER WHO TO TRUST
OR WHO NOT TO TRUST
SURELY ONE MAY TRUST BROTHERS OF THE LODGE
NO NO NOT ALWAYS CRIED MORRIS WITH VEHEMENCE WHATEVER WE SAY
EVEN WHAT WE THINK SEEMS TO GO BACK TO THAT MAN MCGINTY
LOOK HERE SAID MCMURDO STERNLY IT WAS ONLY LAST NIGHT AS YOU
KNOW WELL THAT I SWORE GOOD FAITH TO OUR BODYMASTER WOULD YOU BE
ASKING ME TO BREAK MY OATH
IF THAT IS THE VIEW YOU TAKE SAID MORRIS SADLY I CAN ONLY SAY
THAT I AM SORRY I GAVE YOU THE TROUBLE TO COME AND MEET ME THINGS
HAVE COME TO A BAD PASS WHEN TWO FREE CITIZENS CANNOT SPEAK THEIR
THOUGHTS TO EACH OTHER
MCMURDO WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING HIS COMPANION VERY NARROWLY RELAXED
SOMEWHAT IN HIS BEARING SURE I SPOKE FOR MYSELF ONLY SAID HE I
AM A NEWCOMER AS YOU KNOW AND I AM STRANGE TO IT ALL IT IS NOT FOR
ME TO OPEN MY MOUTH MR MORRIS AND IF YOU THINK WELL TO SAY
ANYTHING TO ME I AM HERE TO HEAR IT
AND TO TAKE IT BACK TO BOSS MCGINTY SAID MORRIS BITTERLY
INDEED THEN YOU DO ME INJUSTICE THERE CRIED MCMURDO FOR MYSELF
I AM LOYAL TO THE LODGE AND SO I TELL YOU STRAIGHT BUT I WOULD BE A
POOR CREATURE IF I WERE TO REPEAT TO ANY OTHER WHAT YOU MIGHT SAY TO
ME IN CONFIDENCE IT WILL GO NO FURTHER THAN ME THOUGH I WARN YOU
THAT YOU MAY GET NEITHER HELP NOR SYMPATHY
I HAVE GIVEN UP LOOKING FOR EITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER SAID
MORRIS I MAY BE PUTTING MY VERY LIFE IN YOUR HANDS BY WHAT I SAY
BUT BAD AS YOU AREAND IT SEEMED TO ME LAST NIGHT THAT YOU WERE
SHAPING TO BE AS BAD AS THE WORSTSTILL YOU ARE NEW TO IT AND YOUR
CONSCIENCE CANNOT YET BE AS HARDENED AS THEIRS THAT WAS WHY I
THOUGHT TO SPEAK WITH YOU

CHICAGO AND SWORE VOWS OF CHARITY AND FIDELITY DID EVER IT CROSS
YOUR MIND THAT YOU MIGHT FIND IT WOULD LEAD YOU TO CRIME

LITTLE WOMAN AND THE CHILDREN THAT MAKES ME ONE ANYHOW I WENT I
GUESS IT WILL HAUNT ME FOREVER

WAS FILLED WITH THE HUGE FIGURE OF BOSS MCGINTY HE PASSED THE SIGN
AND THEN SEATING HIMSELF OPPOSITE TO THE YOUNG MAN HE LOOKED AT HIM
STEADILY FOR SOME TIME A LOOK WHICH WAS AS STEADILY RETURNED
IM NOT MUCH OF A VISITOR BROTHER MCMURDO HE SAID AT LAST I
GUESS I AM TOO BUSY OVER THE FOLK THAT VISIT ME BUT I THOUGHT ID

EARN A LIVING HERE AT HOME HE SHANT KNOW EITHER FOR HE HAS GOT TOO
MUCH CONSCIENCE FOR THE LIKES OF ME BUT HES A GOODHEARTED OLD

INSTANT ROUND THE GLASS AS THOUGH HE WOULD HURL IT AT THE HEAD OF HIS

WELL THATS ENOUGH SAID MCGINTY DRAINING OFF HIS GLASS I CAME

MCGINTY LAUGHED ITS MY BUSINESS TO KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN THIS
TOWNSHIP SAID HE I GUESS YOUD BEST RECKON ON MY HEARING ALL THAT
PASSES WELL TIMES UP AND ILL JUST SAY
BUT HIS LEAVETAKING WAS CUT SHORT IN A VERY UNEXPECTED FASHION WITH
A SUDDEN CRASH THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND THREE FROWNING INTENT FACES
GLARED IN AT THEM FROM UNDER THE PEAKS OF POLICE CAPS MCMURDO SPRANG
TO HIS FEET AND HALF DREW HIS REVOLVER BUT HIS ARM STOPPED MIDWAY AS
HE BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT TWO WINCHESTER RIFLES WERE LEVELLED AT HIS
HEAD A MAN IN UNIFORM ADVANCED INTO THE ROOM A SIXSHOOTER IN HIS
HAND IT WAS CAPTAIN MARVIN ONCE OF CHICAGO AND NOW OF THE MINE
CONSTABULARY HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH A HALFSMILE AT MCMURDO

POLICE CAPTAIN WE ARE NOT OUT AFTER YOU BUT AFTER THIS MAN

THERES MY PISTOL SAID MCMURDO COOLLY MAYBE CAPTAIN MARVIN IF
YOU AND I WERE ALONE AND FACE TO FACE YOU WOULD NOT TAKE ME SO
EASILY
WHERES YOUR WARRANT ASKED MCGINTY BY GAR A MAN MIGHT AS WELL
LIVE IN RUSSIA AS IN VERMISSA WHILE FOLK LIKE YOU ARE RUNNING THE
POLICE ITS A CAPITALIST OUTRAGE AND YOULL HEAR MORE OF IT I
RECKON
YOU DO WHAT YOU THINK IS YOUR DUTY THE BEST WAY YOU CAN COUNCILLOR
WELL LOOK AFTER OURS
WHAT AM I ACCUSED OF ASKED MCMURDO
OF BEING CONCERNED IN THE BEATING OF OLD EDITOR STANGER AT THE
HERALD OFFICE IT WASNT YOUR FAULT THAT IT ISNT A MURDER CHARGE
WELL IF THATS ALL YOU HAVE AGAINST HIM CRIED MCGINTY WITH A
LAUGH YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF A DEAL OF TROUBLE BY DROPPING IT RIGHT
NOW THIS MAN WAS WITH ME IN MY SALOON PLAYING POKER UP TO MIDNIGHT
AND I CAN BRING A DOZEN TO PROVE IT
THATS YOUR AFFAIR AND I GUESS YOU CAN SETTLE IT IN COURT
TOMORROW MEANWHILE COME ON MCMURDO AND COME QUIETLY IF YOU DONT
WANT A GUN ACROSS YOUR HEAD YOU STAND WIDE MR MCGINTY FOR I WARN
YOU I WILL STAND NO RESISTANCE WHEN I AM ON DUTY
SO DETERMINED WAS THE APPEARANCE OF THE CAPTAIN THAT BOTH MCMURDO AND
HIS BOSS WERE FORCED TO ACCEPT THE SITUATION THE LATTER MANAGED TO
HAVE A FEW WHISPERED WORDS WITH THE PRISONER BEFORE THEY PARTED
WHAT ABOUT HE JERKED HIS THUMB UPWARD TO SIGNIFY THE COINING
PLANT
ALL RIGHT WHISPERED MCMURDO WHO HAD DEVISED A SAFE HIDING PLACE
UNDER THE FLOOR
ILL BID YOU GOODBYE SAID THE BOSS SHAKING HANDS ILL SEE
REILLY THE LAWYER AND TAKE THE DEFENSE UPON MYSELF TAKE MY WORD FOR
IT THAT THEY WONT BE ABLE TO HOLD YOU
I WOULDNT BET ON THAT GUARD THE PRISONER YOU TWO AND SHOOT HIM
IF HE TRIES ANY GAMES ILL SEARCH THE HOUSE BEFORE I LEAVE
HE DID SO BUT APPARENTLY FOUND NO TRACE OF THE CONCEALED PLANT WHEN
HE HAD DESCENDED HE AND HIS MEN ESCORTED MCMURDO TO HEADQUARTERS
DARKNESS HAD FALLEN AND A KEEN BLIZZARD WAS BLOWING SO THAT THE
STREETS WERE NEARLY DESERTED BUT A FEW LOITERERS FOLLOWED THE GROUP
AND EMBOLDENED BY INVISIBILITY SHOUTED IMPRECATIONS AT THE PRISONER
LYNCH THE CURSED SCOWRER THEY CRIED LYNCH HIM THEY LAUGHED AND
JEERED AS HE WAS PUSHED INTO THE POLICE STATION AFTER A SHORT
FORMAL EXAMINATION FROM THE INSPECTOR IN CHARGE HE WAS PUT INTO THE
COMMON CELL HERE HE FOUND BALDWIN AND THREE OTHER CRIMINALS OF THE
NIGHT BEFORE ALL ARRESTED THAT AFTERNOON AND WAITING THEIR TRIAL
NEXT MORNING
BUT EVEN WITHIN THIS INNER FORTRESS OF THE LAW THE LONG ARM OF THE
FREEMEN WAS ABLE TO EXTEND LATE AT NIGHT THERE CAME A JAILER WITH A
STRAW BUNDLE FOR THEIR BEDDING OUT OF WHICH HE EXTRACTED TWO BOTTLES
OF WHISKY SOME GLASSES AND A PACK OF CARDS THEY SPENT A HILARIOUS
NIGHT WITHOUT AN ANXIOUS THOUGHT AS TO THE ORDEAL OF THE MORNING
NOR HAD THEY CAUSE AS THE RESULT WAS TO SHOW THE MAGISTRATE COULD
NOT POSSIBLY ON THE EVIDENCE HAVE HELD THEM FOR A HIGHER COURT ON
THE ONE HAND THE COMPOSITORS AND PRESSMEN WERE FORCED TO ADMIT THAT
THE LIGHT WAS UNCERTAIN THAT THEY WERE THEMSELVES MUCH PERTURBED
AND THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SWEAR TO THE IDENTITY OF THE
ASSAILANTS ALTHOUGH THEY BELIEVED THAT THE ACCUSED WERE AMONG THEM
CROSS EXAMINED BY THE CLEVER ATTORNEY WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED BY
MCGINTY THEY WERE EVEN MORE NEBULOUS IN THEIR EVIDENCE
THE INJURED MAN HAD ALREADY DEPOSED THAT HE WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE
BY THE SUDDENNESS OF THE ATTACK THAT HE COULD STATE NOTHING BEYOND
THE FACT THAT THE FIRST MAN WHO STRUCK HIM WORE A MOUSTACHE HE ADDED
THAT HE KNEW THEM TO BE SCOWRERS SINCE NO ONE ELSE IN THE COMMUNITY
COULD POSSIBLY HAVE ANY ENMITY TO HIM AND HE HAD LONG BEEN
THREATENED ON ACCOUNT OF HIS OUTSPOKEN EDITORIALS ON THE OTHER HAND
IT WAS CLEARLY SHOWN BY THE UNITED AND UNFALTERING EVIDENCE OF SIX
CITIZENS INCLUDING THAT HIGH MUNICIPAL OFFICIAL COUNCILLOR MCGINTY
THAT THE MEN HAD BEEN AT A CARD PARTY AT THE UNION HOUSE UNTIL AN
HOUR VERY MUCH LATER THAN THE COMMISSION OF THE OUTRAGE
NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THEY WERE DISCHARGED WITH SOMETHING VERY NEAR TO
AN APOLOGY FROM THE BENCH FOR THE INCONVENIENCE TO WHICH THEY HAD
BEEN PUT TOGETHER WITH AN IMPLIED CENSURE OF CAPTAIN MARVIN AND THE
POLICE FOR THEIR OFFICIOUS ZEAL
THE VERDICT WAS GREETED WITH LOUD APPLAUSE BY A COURT IN WHICH
MCMURDO SAW MANY FAMILIAR FACES BROTHERS OF THE LODGE SMILED AND
WAVED BUT THERE WERE OTHERS WHO SAT WITH COMPRESSED LIPS AND
BROODING EYES AS THE MEN FILED OUT OF THE DOCK ONE OF THEM A
LITTLE DARKBEARDED RESOLUTE FELLOW PUT THE THOUGHTS OF HIMSELF
AND COMRADES INTO WORDS AS THE EXPRISONERS PASSED HIM
YOU DAMNED MURDERERS HE SAID WELL FIX YOU YET
CHAPTER V
THE DARKEST HOUR
IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN NEEDED TO GIVE AN IMPETUS TO JACK MCMURDOS
POPULARITY AMONG HIS FELLOWS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS ARREST AND
ACQUITTAL THAT A MAN ON THE VERY NIGHT OF JOINING THE LODGE SHOULD
HAVE DONE SOMETHING WHICH BROUGHT HIM BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE WAS A NEW
RECORD IN THE ANNALS OF THE SOCIETY ALREADY HE HAD EARNED THE
REPUTATION OF A GOOD BOON COMPANION A CHEERY REVELLER AND WITHAL A
MAN OF HIGH TEMPER WHO WOULD NOT TAKE AN INSULT EVEN FROM THE
ALLPOWERFUL BOSS HIMSELF BUT IN ADDITION TO THIS HE IMPRESSED HIS
COMRADES WITH THE IDEA THAT AMONG THEM ALL THERE WAS NOT ONE WHOSE
BRAIN WAS SO READY TO DEVISE A BLOODTHIRSTY SCHEME OR WHOSE HAND
WOULD BE MORE CAPABLE OF CARRYING IT OUT HELL BE THE BOY FOR THE
CLEAN JOB SAID THE OLDSTERS TO ONE ANOTHER AND WAITED THEIR TIME
UNTIL THEY COULD SET HIM TO HIS WORK
MCGINTY HAD INSTRUMENTS ENOUGH ALREADY BUT HE RECOGNIZED THAT THIS
WAS A SUPREMELY ABLE ONE HE FELT LIKE A MAN HOLDING A FIERCE
BLOODHOUND IN LEASH THERE WERE CURS TO DO THE SMALLER WORK BUT SOME
DAY HE WOULD SLIP THIS CREATURE UPON ITS PREY A FEW MEMBERS OF THE
LODGE TED BALDWIN AMONG THEM RESENTED THE RAPID RISE OF THE
STRANGER AND HATED HIM FOR IT BUT THEY KEPT CLEAR OF HIM FOR HE WAS
AS READY TO FIGHT AS TO LAUGH
BUT IF HE GAINED FAVOUR WITH HIS FELLOWS THERE WAS ANOTHER QUARTER
ONE WHICH HAD BECOME EVEN MORE VITAL TO HIM IN WHICH HE LOST IT
ETTIE SHAFTERS FATHER WOULD HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH HIM NOR
WOULD HE ALLOW HIM TO ENTER THE HOUSE ETTIE HERSELF WAS TOO DEEPLY
IN LOVE TO GIVE HIM UP ALTOGETHER AND YET HER OWN GOOD SENSE WARNED
HER OF WHAT WOULD COME FROM A MARRIAGE WITH A MAN WHO WAS REGARDED AS
A CRIMINAL
ONE MORNING AFTER A SLEEPLESS NIGHT SHE DETERMINED TO SEE HIM
POSSIBLY FOR THE LAST TIME AND MAKE ONE STRONG ENDEAVOUR TO DRAW HIM
FROM THOSE EVIL INFLUENCES WHICH WERE SUCKING HIM DOWN SHE WENT TO
HIS HOUSE AS HE HAD OFTEN BEGGED HER TO DO AND MADE HER WAY INTO
THE ROOM WHICH HE USED AS HIS SITTINGROOM HE WAS SEATED AT A TABLE
WITH HIS BACK TURNED AND A LETTER IN FRONT OF HIM A SUDDEN SPIRIT OF
GIRLISH MISCHIEF CAME OVER HERSHE WAS STILL ONLY NINETEEN HE HAD
NOT HEARD HER WHEN SHE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR NOW SHE TIPTOED FORWARD
AND LAID HER HAND LIGHTLY UPON HIS BENDED SHOULDERS
IF SHE HAD EXPECTED TO STARTLE HIM SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BUT ONLY
IN TURN TO BE STARTLED HERSELF WITH A TIGER SPRING HE TURNED ON HER
AND HIS RIGHT HAND WAS FEELING FOR HER THROAT AT THE SAME INSTANT
WITH THE OTHER HAND HE CRUMPLED UP THE PAPER THAT LAY BEFORE HIM FOR
AN INSTANT HE STOOD GLARING THEN ASTONISHMENT AND JOY TOOK THE PLACE
OF THE FEROCITY WHICH HAD CONVULSED HIS FEATURESA FEROCITY WHICH
HAD SENT HER SHRINKING BACK IN HORROR AS FROM SOMETHING WHICH HAD
NEVER BEFORE INTRUDED INTO HER GENTLE LIFE
ITS YOU SAID HE MOPPING HIS BROW AND TO THINK THAT YOU SHOULD
COME TO ME HEART OF MY HEART AND I SHOULD FIND NOTHING BETTER TO DO
THAN TO WANT TO STRANGLE YOU COME THEN DARLING AND HE HELD OUT
HIS ARMS LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU
BUT SHE HAD NOT RECOVERED FROM THAT SUDDEN GLIMPSE OF GUILTY FEAR
WHICH SHE HAD READ IN THE MANS FACE ALL HER WOMANS INSTINCT TOLD
HER THAT IT WAS NOT THE MERE FRIGHT OF A MAN WHO IS STARTLED
GUILTTHAT WAS ITGUILT AND FEAR
WHATS COME OVER YOU JACK SHE CRIED WHY WERE YOU SO SCARED OF
ME OH JACK IF YOUR CONSCIENCE WAS AT EASE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE
LOOKED AT ME LIKE THAT
SURE I WAS THINKING OF OTHER THINGS AND WHEN YOU CAME TRIPPING SO
LIGHTLY ON THOSE FAIRY FEET OF YOURS
NO NO IT WAS MORE THAN THAT JACK THEN A SUDDEN SUSPICION SEIZED
HER LET ME SEE THAT LETTER YOU WERE WRITING
AH ETTIE I COULDNT DO THAT
HER SUSPICIONS BECAME CERTAINTIES ITS TO ANOTHER WOMAN SHE
CRIED I KNOW IT WHY ELSE SHOULD YOU HOLD IT FROM ME WAS IT TO
YOUR WIFE THAT YOU WERE WRITING HOW AM I TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT A
MARRIED MANYOU A STRANGER THAT NOBODY KNOWS
I AM NOT MARRIED ETTIE SEE NOW I SWEAR IT YOURE THE ONLY ONE
WOMAN ON EARTH TO ME BY THE CROSS OF CHRIST I SWEAR IT
HE WAS SO WHITE WITH PASSIONATE EARNESTNESS THAT SHE COULD NOT BUT
BELIEVE HIM
WELL THEN SHE CRIED WHY WILL YOU NOT SHOW ME THE LETTER
ILL TELL YOU ACUSHLA SAID HE IM UNDER OATH NOT TO SHOW IT
AND JUST AS I WOULDNT BREAK MY WORD TO YOU SO I WOULD KEEP IT TO
THOSE WHO HOLD MY PROMISE ITS THE BUSINESS OF THE LODGE AND EVEN
TO YOU ITS SECRET AND IF I WAS SCARED WHEN A HAND FELL ON ME CANT
YOU UNDERSTAND IT WHEN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE HAND OF A DETECTIVE
SHE FELT THAT HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH HE GATHERED HER INTO HIS ARMS
AND KISSED AWAY HER FEARS AND DOUBTS
SIT HERE BY ME THEN ITS A QUEER THRONE FOR SUCH A QUEEN BUT ITS
THE BEST YOUR POOR LOVER CAN FIND HELL DO BETTER FOR YOU SOME OF
THESE DAYS IM THINKING NOW YOUR MIND IS EASY ONCE AGAIN IS IT
NOT
HOW CAN IT EVER BE AT EASE JACK WHEN I KNOW THAT YOU ARE A
CRIMINAL AMONG CRIMINALS WHEN I NEVER KNOW THE DAY THAT I MAY HEAR
YOU ARE IN COURT FOR MURDER MCMURDO THE SCOWRER THATS WHAT ONE
OF OUR BOARDERS CALLED YOU YESTERDAY IT WENT THROUGH MY HEART LIKE A
KNIFE
SURE HARD WORDS BREAK NO BONES
BUT THEY WERE TRUE
WELL DEAR ITS NOT SO BAD AS YOU THINK WE ARE BUT POOR MEN THAT
ARE TRYING IN OUR OWN WAY TO GET OUR RIGHTS
ETTIE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HER LOVERS NECK GIVE IT UP JACK FOR
MY SAKE FOR GODS SAKE GIVE IT UP IT WAS TO ASK YOU THAT I CAME
HERE TODAY OH JACK SEEI BEG IT OF YOU ON MY BENDED KNEES
KNEELING HERE BEFORE YOU I IMPLORE YOU TO GIVE IT UP
HE RAISED HER AND SOOTHED HER WITH HER HEAD AGAINST HIS BREAST
SURE MY DARLIN YOU DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU ARE ASKING HOW
COULD I GIVE IT UP WHEN IT WOULD BE TO BREAK MY OATH AND TO DESERT MY
COMRADES IF YOU COULD SEE HOW THINGS STAND WITH ME YOU COULD NEVER
ASK IT OF ME BESIDES IF I WANTED TO HOW COULD I DO IT YOU DONT
SUPPOSE THAT THE LODGE WOULD LET A MAN GO FREE WITH ALL ITS SECRETS
IVE THOUGHT OF THAT JACK IVE PLANNED IT ALL FATHER HAS SAVED
SOME MONEY HE IS WEARY OF THIS PLACE WHERE THE FEAR OF THESE PEOPLE
DARKENS OUR LIVES HE IS READY TO GO WE WOULD FLY TOGETHER TO
PHILADELPHIA OR NEW YORK WHERE WE WOULD BE SAFE FROM THEM
MCMURDO LAUGHED THE LODGE HAS A LONG ARM DO YOU THINK IT COULD NOT
STRETCH FROM HERE TO PHILADELPHIA OR NEW YORK
WELL THEN TO THE WEST OR TO ENGLAND OR TO GERMANY WHERE FATHER
CAME FROMANYWHERE TO GET AWAY FROM THIS VALLEY OF FEAR
MCMURDO THOUGHT OF OLD BROTHER MORRIS SURE IT IS THE SECOND TIME I
HAVE HEARD THE VALLEY SO NAMED SAID HE THE SHADOW DOES INDEED
SEEM TO LIE HEAVY ON SOME OF YOU
IT DARKENS EVERY MOMENT OF OUR LIVES DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT TED
BALDWIN HAS EVER FORGIVEN US IF IT WERE NOT THAT HE FEARS YOU WHAT
DO YOU SUPPOSE OUR CHANCES WOULD BE IF YOU SAW THE LOOK IN THOSE
DARK HUNGRY EYES OF HIS WHEN THEY FALL ON ME
BY GAR ID TEACH HIM BETTER MANNERS IF I CAUGHT HIM AT IT BUT SEE
HERE LITTLE GIRL I CANT LEAVE HERE I CANTTAKE THAT FROM ME
ONCE AND FOR ALL BUT IF YOU WILL LEAVE ME TO FIND MY OWN WAY I WILL
TRY TO PREPARE A WAY OF GETTING HONOURABLY OUT OF IT
THERE IS NO HONOUR IN SUCH A MATTER
WELL WELL ITS JUST HOW YOU LOOK AT IT BUT IF YOULL GIVE ME SIX
MONTHS ILL WORK IT SO THAT I CAN LEAVE WITHOUT BEING ASHAMED TO
LOOK OTHERS IN THE FACE
THE GIRL LAUGHED WITH JOY SIX MONTHS SHE CRIED IS IT A
PROMISE
WELL IT MAY BE SEVEN OR EIGHT BUT WITHIN A YEAR AT THE FURTHEST WE
WILL LEAVE THE VALLEY BEHIND US
IT WAS THE MOST THAT ETTIE COULD OBTAIN AND YET IT WAS SOMETHING
THERE WAS THIS DISTANT LIGHT TO ILLUMINATE THE GLOOM OF THE IMMEDIATE
FUTURE SHE RETURNED TO HER FATHERS HOUSE MORE LIGHTHEARTED THAN
SHE HAD EVER BEEN SINCE JACK MCMURDO HAD COME INTO HER LIFE
IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT THAT AS A MEMBER ALL THE DOINGS OF THE SOCIETY
WOULD BE TOLD TO HIM BUT HE WAS SOON TO DISCOVER THAT THE
ORGANIZATION WAS WIDER AND MORE COMPLEX THAN THE SIMPLE LODGE EVEN
BOSS MCGINTY WAS IGNORANT AS TO MANY THINGS FOR THERE WAS AN
OFFICIAL NAMED THE COUNTY DELEGATE LIVING AT HOBSONS PATCH FARTHER
DOWN THE LINE WHO HAD POWER OVER SEVERAL DIFFERENT LODGES WHICH HE
WIELDED IN A SUDDEN AND ARBITRARY WAY ONLY ONCE DID MCMURDO SEE HIM
A SLY LITTLE GRAYHAIRED RAT OF A MAN WITH A SLINKING GAIT AND A
SIDELONG GLANCE WHICH WAS CHARGED WITH MALICE EVANS POTT WAS HIS
NAME AND EVEN THE GREAT BOSS OF VERMISSA FELT TOWARDS HIM SOMETHING
OF THE REPULSION AND FEAR WHICH THE HUGE DANTON MAY HAVE FELT FOR THE
PUNY BUT DANGEROUS ROBESPIERRE
ONE DAY SCANLAN WHO WAS MCMURDOS FELLOW BOARDER RECEIVED A NOTE
FROM MCGINTY INCLOSING ONE FROM EVANS POTT WHICH INFORMED HIM THAT
HE WAS SENDING OVER TWO GOOD MEN LAWLER AND ANDREWS WHO HAD
INSTRUCTIONS TO ACT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THOUGH IT WAS BEST FOR THE
CAUSE THAT NO PARTICULARS AS TO THEIR OBJECTS SHOULD BE GIVEN WOULD
THE BODYMASTER SEE TO IT THAT SUITABLE ARRANGEMENTS BE MADE FOR THEIR
LODGINGS AND COMFORT UNTIL THE TIME FOR ACTION SHOULD ARRIVE MCGINTY
ADDED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO REMAIN SECRET AT THE UNION
HOUSE AND THAT THEREFORE HE WOULD BE OBLIGED IF MCMURDO AND
SCANLAN WOULD PUT THE STRANGERS UP FOR A FEW DAYS IN THEIR BOARDING
HOUSE
THE SAME EVENING THE TWO MEN ARRIVED EACH CARRYING HIS GRIPSACK
LAWLER WAS AN ELDERLY MAN SHREWD SILENT AND SELFCONTAINED CLAD
IN AN OLD BLACK FROCK COAT WHICH WITH HIS SOFT FELT HAT AND RAGGED
GRIZZLED BEARD GAVE HIM A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE TO AN ITINERANT
PREACHER HIS COMPANION ANDREWS WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A BOY
FRANKFACED AND CHEERFUL WITH THE BREEZY MANNER OF ONE WHO IS OUT
FOR A HOLIDAY AND MEANS TO ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT BOTH MEN WERE
TOTAL ABSTAINERS AND BEHAVED IN ALL WAYS AS EXEMPLARY MEMBERS OF THE
SOCIETY WITH THE ONE SIMPLE EXCEPTION THAT THEY WERE ASSASSINS WHO
HAD OFTEN PROVED THEMSELVES TO BE MOST CAPABLE INSTRUMENTS FOR THIS
ASSOCIATION OF MURDER LAWLER HAD ALREADY CARRIED OUT FOURTEEN
COMMISSIONS OF THE KIND AND ANDREWS THREE
THEY WERE AS MCMURDO FOUND QUITE READY TO CONVERSE ABOUT THEIR
DEEDS IN THE PAST WHICH THEY RECOUNTED WITH THE HALFBASHFUL PRIDE
OF MEN WHO HAD DONE GOOD AND UNSELFISH SERVICE FOR THE COMMUNITY
THEY WERE RETICENT HOWEVER AS TO THE IMMEDIATE JOB IN HAND
THEY CHOSE US BECAUSE NEITHER I NOR THE BOY HERE DRINK LAWLER
EXPLAINED THEY CAN COUNT ON US SAYING NO MORE THAN WE SHOULD YOU
MUST NOT TAKE IT AMISS BUT IT IS THE ORDERS OF THE COUNTY DELEGATE
THAT WE OBEY
SURE WE ARE ALL IN IT TOGETHER SAID SCANLAN MCMURDOS MATE AS
THE FOUR SAT TOGETHER AT SUPPER
THATS TRUE ENOUGH AND WELL TALK TILL THE COWS COME HOME OF THE
KILLING OF CHARLIE WILLIAMS OR OF SIMON BIRD OR ANY OTHER JOB IN THE
PAST BUT TILL THE WORK IS DONE WE SAY NOTHING
THERE ARE HALF A DOZEN ABOUT HERE THAT I HAVE A WORD TO SAY TO
SAID MCMURDO WITH AN OATH I SUPPOSE IT ISNT JACK KNOX OF IRONHILL
THAT YOU ARE AFTER ID GO SOME WAY TO SEE HIM GET HIS DESERTS
NO ITS NOT HIM YET
OR HERMAN STRAUSS
NO NOR HIM EITHER
WELL IF YOU WONT TELL US WE CANT MAKE YOU BUT ID BE GLAD TO
KNOW
LAWLER SMILED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD HE WAS NOT TO BE DRAWN
IN SPITE OF THE RETICENCE OF THEIR GUESTS SCANLAN AND MCMURDO WERE
QUITE DETERMINED TO BE PRESENT AT WHAT THEY CALLED THE FUN WHEN
THEREFORE AT AN EARLY HOUR ONE MORNING MCMURDO HEARD THEM CREEPING
DOWN THE STAIRS HE AWAKENED SCANLAN AND THE TWO HURRIED ON THEIR
CLOTHES WHEN THEY WERE DRESSED THEY FOUND THAT THE OTHERS HAD STOLEN
OUT LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN BEHIND THEM IT WAS NOT YET DAWN AND BY
THE LIGHT OF THE LAMPS THEY COULD SEE THE TWO MEN SOME DISTANCE DOWN
THE STREET THEY FOLLOWED THEM WARILY TREADING NOISELESSLY IN THE
DEEP SNOW
THE BOARDING HOUSE WAS NEAR THE EDGE OF THE TOWN AND SOON THEY WERE
AT THE CROSSROADS WHICH IS BEYOND ITS BOUNDARY HERE THREE MEN WERE
WAITING WITH WHOM LAWLER AND ANDREWS HELD A SHORT EAGER
CONVERSATION THEN THEY ALL MOVED ON TOGETHER IT WAS CLEARLY SOME
NOTABLE JOB WHICH NEEDED NUMBERS AT THIS POINT THERE ARE SEVERAL
TRAILS WHICH LEAD TO VARIOUS MINES THE STRANGERS TOOK THAT WHICH LED
TO THE CROW HILL A HUGE BUSINESS WHICH WAS IN STRONG HANDS WHICH HAD
BEEN ABLE THANKS TO THEIR ENERGETIC AND FEARLESS NEW ENGLAND
MANAGER JOSIAH H DUNN TO KEEP SOME ORDER AND DISCIPLINE DURING THE
LONG REIGN OF TERROR
DAY WAS BREAKING NOW AND A LINE OF WORKMEN WERE SLOWLY MAKING THEIR
WAY SINGLY AND IN GROUPS ALONG THE BLACKENED PATH
MCMURDO AND SCANLAN STROLLED ON WITH THE OTHERS KEEPING IN SIGHT OF
THE MEN WHOM THEY FOLLOWED A THICK MIST LAY OVER THEM AND FROM THE
HEART OF IT THERE CAME THE SUDDEN SCREAM OF A STEAM WHISTLE IT WAS
THE TENMINUTE SIGNAL BEFORE THE CAGES DESCENDED AND THE DAYS LABOUR
BEGAN
WHEN THEY REACHED THE OPEN SPACE ROUND THE MINE SHAFT THERE WERE A
HUNDRED MINERS WAITING STAMPING THEIR FEET AND BLOWING ON THEIR
FINGERS FOR IT WAS BITTERLY COLD THE STRANGERS STOOD IN A LITTLE
GROUP UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE ENGINE HOUSE SCANLAN AND MCMURDO
CLIMBED A HEAP OF SLAG FROM WHICH THE WHOLE SCENE LAY BEFORE THEM
THEY SAW THE MINE ENGINEER A GREAT BEARDED SCOTCHMAN NAMED MENZIES
COME OUT OF THE ENGINE HOUSE AND BLOW HIS WHISTLE FOR THE CAGES TO BE
LOWERED
AT THE SAME INSTANT A TALL LOOSEFRAMED YOUNG MAN WITH A
CLEANSHAVED EARNEST FACE ADVANCED EAGERLY TOWARDS THE PIT HEAD AS
HE CAME FORWARD HIS EYES FELL UPON THE GROUP SILENT AND MOTIONLESS
UNDER THE ENGINE HOUSE THE MEN HAD DRAWN DOWN THEIR HATS AND TURNED
UP THEIR COLLARS TO SCREEN THEIR FACES FOR A MOMENT THE PRESENTIMENT
OF DEATH LAID ITS COLD HAND UPON THE MANAGERS HEART AT THE NEXT HE
HAD SHAKEN IT OFF AND SAW ONLY HIS DUTY TOWARDS INTRUSIVE STRANGERS
WHO ARE YOU HE ASKED AS HE ADVANCED WHAT ARE YOU LOITERING THERE
FOR
THERE WAS NO ANSWER BUT THE LAD ANDREWS STEPPED FORWARD AND SHOT HIM
IN THE STOMACH THE HUNDRED WAITING MINERS STOOD AS MOTIONLESS AND
HELPLESS AS IF THEY WERE PARALYZED THE MANAGER CLAPPED HIS TWO HANDS
TO THE WOUND AND DOUBLED HIMSELF UP THEN HE STAGGERED AWAY BUT
ANOTHER OF THE ASSASSINS FIRED AND HE WENT DOWN SIDEWISE KICKING
AND CLAWING AMONG A HEAP OF CLINKERS MENZIES THE SCOTCHMAN GAVE A
ROAR OF RAGE AT THE SIGHT AND RUSHED WITH AN IRON SPANNER AT THE
MURDERERS BUT WAS MET BY TWO BALLS IN THE FACE WHICH DROPPED HIM
DEAD AT THEIR VERY FEET
THERE WAS A SURGE FORWARD OF SOME OF THE MINERS AND AN INARTICULATE
CRY OF PITY AND OF ANGER BUT A COUPLE OF THE STRANGERS EMPTIED THEIR
SIXSHOOTERS OVER THE HEADS OF THE CROWD AND THEY BROKE AND
SCATTERED SOME OF THEM RUSHING WILDLY BACK TO THEIR HOMES IN
VERMISSA
WHEN A FEW OF THE BRAVEST HAD RALLIED AND THERE WAS A RETURN TO THE
MINE THE MURDEROUS GANG HAD VANISHED IN THE MISTS OF MORNING
WITHOUT A SINGLE WITNESS BEING ABLE TO SWEAR TO THE IDENTITY OF THESE
MEN WHO IN FRONT OF A HUNDRED SPECTATORS HAD WROUGHT THIS DOUBLE
CRIME
SCANLAN AND MCMURDO MADE THEIR WAY BACK SCANLAN SOMEWHAT SUBDUED
FOR IT WAS THE FIRST MURDER JOB THAT HE HAD SEEN WITH HIS OWN EYES
AND IT APPEARED LESS FUNNY THAN HE HAD BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THE
HORRIBLE SCREAMS OF THE DEAD MANAGERS WIFE PURSUED THEM AS THEY
HURRIED TO THE TOWN MCMURDO WAS ABSORBED AND SILENT BUT HE SHOWED
NO SYMPATHY FOR THE WEAKENING OF HIS COMPANION
SURE IT IS LIKE A WAR HE REPEATED WHAT IS IT BUT A WAR BETWEEN
US AND THEM AND WE HIT BACK WHERE WE BEST CAN
THERE WAS HIGH REVEL IN THE LODGE ROOM AT THE UNION HOUSE THAT NIGHT
NOT ONLY OVER THE KILLING OF THE MANAGER AND ENGINEER OF THE CROW
HILL MINE WHICH WOULD BRING THIS ORGANIZATION INTO LINE WITH THE
OTHER BLACKMAILED AND TERRORSTRICKEN COMPANIES OF THE DISTRICT BUT
ALSO OVER A DISTANT TRIUMPH WHICH HAD BEEN WROUGHT BY THE HANDS OF
THE LODGE ITSELF
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT WHEN THE COUNTY DELEGATE HAD SENT OVER FIVE GOOD
MEN TO STRIKE A BLOW IN VERMISSA HE HAD DEMANDED THAT IN RETURN
THREE VERMISSA MEN SHOULD BE SECRETLY SELECTED AND SENT ACROSS TO
KILL WILLIAM HALES OF STAKE ROYAL ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN AND MOST
POPULAR MINE OWNERS IN THE GILMERTON DISTRICT A MAN WHO WAS BELIEVED
NOT TO HAVE AN ENEMY IN THE WORLD FOR HE WAS IN ALL WAYS A MODEL
EMPLOYER HE HAD INSISTED HOWEVER UPON EFFICIENCY IN THE WORK AND
HAD THEREFORE PAID OFF CERTAIN DRUNKEN AND IDLE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE
MEMBERS OF THE ALLPOWERFUL SOCIETY COFFIN NOTICES HUNG OUTSIDE HIS
DOOR HAD NOT WEAKENED HIS RESOLUTION AND SO IN A FREE CIVILIZED
COUNTRY HE FOUND HIMSELF CONDEMNED TO DEATH
THE EXECUTION HAD NOW BEEN DULY CARRIED OUT TED BALDWIN WHO
SPRAWLED NOW IN THE SEAT OF HONOUR BESIDE THE BODYMASTER HAD BEEN
CHIEF OF THE PARTY HIS FLUSHED FACE AND GLAZED BLOODSHOT EYES TOLD
OF SLEEPLESSNESS AND DRINK HE AND HIS TWO COMRADES HAD SPENT THE
NIGHT BEFORE AMONG THE MOUNTAINS THEY WERE UNKEMPT AND
WEATHERSTAINED BUT NO HEROES RETURNING FROM A FORLORN HOPE COULD
HAVE HAD A WARMER WELCOME FROM THEIR COMRADES
THE STORY WAS TOLD AND RETOLD AMID CRIES OF DELIGHT AND SHOUTS OF
LAUGHTER THEY HAD WAITED FOR THEIR MAN AS HE DROVE HOME AT
NIGHTFALL TAKING THEIR STATION AT THE TOP OF A STEEP HILL WHERE HIS
HORSE MUST BE AT A WALK HE WAS SO FURRED TO KEEP OUT THE COLD THAT
HE COULD NOT LAY HIS HAND ON HIS PISTOL THEY HAD PULLED HIM OUT AND
SHOT HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN HE HAD SCREAMED FOR MERCY THE SCREAMS WERE
REPEATED FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE LODGE
LETS HEAR AGAIN HOW HE SQUEALED THEY CRIED
NONE OF THEM KNEW THE MAN BUT THERE IS ETERNAL DRAMA IN A KILLING
AND THEY HAD SHOWN THE SCOWRERS OF GILMERTON THAT THE VERMISSA MEN
WERE TO BE RELIED UPON
THERE HAD BEEN ONE CONTRETEMPS FOR A MAN AND HIS WIFE HAD DRIVEN UP
WHILE THEY WERE STILL EMPTYING THEIR REVOLVERS INTO THE SILENT BODY
IT HAD BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD SHOOT THEM BOTH BUT THEY WERE
HARMLESS FOLK WHO WERE NOT CONNECTED WITH THE MINES SO THEY WERE
STERNLY BIDDEN TO DRIVE ON AND KEEP SILENT LEST A WORSE THING BEFALL
THEM AND SO THE BLOODMOTTLED FIGURE HAD BEEN LEFT AS A WARNING TO
ALL SUCH HARDHEARTED EMPLOYERS AND THE THREE NOBLE AVENGERS HAD
HURRIED OFF INTO THE MOUNTAINS WHERE UNBROKEN NATURE COMES DOWN TO
THE VERY EDGE OF THE FURNACES AND THE SLAG HEAPS HERE THEY WERE
SAFE AND SOUND THEIR WORK WELL DONE AND THE PLAUDITS OF THEIR
COMPANIONS IN THEIR EARS
IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DAY FOR THE SCOWRERS THE SHADOW HAD FALLEN EVEN
DARKER OVER THE VALLEY BUT AS THE WISE GENERAL CHOOSES THE MOMENT OF
VICTORY IN WHICH TO REDOUBLE HIS EFFORTS SO THAT HIS FOES MAY HAVE
NO TIME TO STEADY THEMSELVES AFTER DISASTER SO BOSS MCGINTY LOOKING
OUT UPON THE SCENE OF HIS OPERATIONS WITH HIS BROODING AND MALICIOUS
EYES HAD DEVISED A NEW ATTACK UPON THOSE WHO OPPOSED HIM THAT VERY
NIGHT AS THE HALFDRUNKEN COMPANY BROKE UP HE TOUCHED MCMURDO ON
THE ARM AND LED HIM ASIDE INTO THAT INNER ROOM WHERE THEY HAD THEIR
FIRST INTERVIEW
SEE HERE MY LAD SAID HE IVE GOT A JOB THATS WORTHY OF YOU AT
LAST YOULL HAVE THE DOING OF IT IN YOUR OWN HANDS
PROUD I AM TO HEAR IT MCMURDO ANSWERED
YOU CAN TAKE TWO MEN WITH YOUMANDERS AND REILLY THEY HAVE BEEN
WARNED FOR SERVICE WELL NEVER BE RIGHT IN THIS DISTRICT UNTIL
CHESTER WILCOX HAS BEEN SETTLED AND YOULL HAVE THE THANKS OF EVERY
LODGE IN THE COAL FIELDS IF YOU CAN DOWN HIM
ILL DO MY BEST ANYHOW WHO IS HE AND WHERE SHALL I FIND HIM
MCGINTY TOOK HIS ETERNAL HALFCHEWED HALFSMOKED CIGAR FROM THE
CORNER OF HIS MOUTH AND PROCEEDED TO DRAW A ROUGH DIAGRAM ON A PAGE
TORN FROM HIS NOTEBOOK
HES THE CHIEF FOREMAN OF THE IRON DIKE COMPANY HES A HARD
CITIZEN AN OLD COLOUR SERGEANT OF THE WAR ALL SCARS AND GRIZZLE
WEVE HAD TWO TRIES AT HIM BUT HAD NO LUCK AND JIM CARNAWAY LOST
HIS LIFE OVER IT NOW ITS FOR YOU TO TAKE IT OVER THATS THE
HOUSEALL ALONE AT THE IRON DIKE CROSSROAD SAME AS YOU SEE HERE ON
THE MAPWITHOUT ANOTHER WITHIN EARSHOT ITS NO GOOD BY DAY HES
ARMED AND SHOOTS QUICK AND STRAIGHT WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED BUT AT
NIGHTWELL THERE HE IS WITH HIS WIFE THREE CHILDREN AND A HIRED
HELP YOU CANT PICK OR CHOOSE ITS ALL OR NONE IF YOU COULD GET A
BAG OF BLASTING POWDER AT THE FRONT DOOR WITH A SLOW MATCH TO IT
WHATS THE MAN DONE
DIDNT I TELL YOU HE SHOT JIM CARNAWAY
WHY DID HE SHOOT HIM
WHAT IN THUNDER HAS THAT TO DO WITH YOU CARNAWAY WAS ABOUT HIS
HOUSE AT NIGHT AND HE SHOT HIM THATS ENOUGH FOR ME AND YOU YOUVE
GOT TO SETTLE THE THING RIGHT
THERES THESE TWO WOMEN AND THE CHILDREN DO THEY GO UP TOO
THEY HAVE TOELSE HOW CAN WE GET HIM
IT SEEMS HARD ON THEM FOR THEYVE DONE NOTHING
WHAT SORT OF FOOLS TALK IS THIS DO YOU BACK OUT
EASY COUNCILLOR EASY WHAT HAVE I EVER SAID OR DONE THAT YOU
SHOULD THINK I WOULD BE AFTER STANDING BACK FROM AN ORDER OF THE
BODYMASTER OF MY OWN LODGE IF ITS RIGHT OR IF ITS WRONG ITS FOR
YOU TO DECIDE
YOULL DO IT THEN
OF COURSE I WILL DO IT
WHEN
WELL YOU HAD BEST GIVE ME A NIGHT OR TWO THAT I MAY SEE THE HOUSE
AND MAKE MY PLANS THEN
VERY GOOD SAID MCGINTY SHAKING HIM BY THE HAND I LEAVE IT WITH
YOU IT WILL BE A GREAT DAY WHEN YOU BRING US THE NEWS ITS JUST THE
LAST STROKE THAT WILL BRING THEM ALL TO THEIR KNEES
MCMURDO THOUGHT LONG AND DEEPLY OVER THE COMMISSION WHICH HAD BEEN SO
SUDDENLY PLACED IN HIS HANDS THE ISOLATED HOUSE IN WHICH CHESTER
WILCOX LIVED WAS ABOUT FIVE MILES OFF IN AN ADJACENT VALLEY THAT
VERY NIGHT HE STARTED OFF ALL ALONE TO PREPARE FOR THE ATTEMPT IT
WAS DAYLIGHT BEFORE HE RETURNED FROM HIS RECONNAISSANCE NEXT DAY HE
INTERVIEWED HIS TWO SUBORDINATES MANDERS AND REILLY RECKLESS
YOUNGSTERS WHO WERE AS ELATED AS IF IT WERE A DEERHUNT
TWO NIGHTS LATER THEY MET OUTSIDE THE TOWN ALL THREE ARMED AND ONE
OF THEM CARRYING A SACK STUFFED WITH THE POWDER WHICH WAS USED IN THE
QUARRIES IT WAS TWO IN THE MORNING BEFORE THEY CAME TO THE LONELY
HOUSE THE NIGHT WAS A WINDY ONE WITH BROKEN CLOUDS DRIFTING SWIFTLY
ACROSS THE FACE OF A THREEQUARTER MOON THEY HAD BEEN WARNED TO BE
ON THEIR GUARD AGAINST BLOODHOUNDS SO THEY MOVED FORWARD CAUTIOUSLY
WITH THEIR PISTOLS COCKED IN THEIR HANDS BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND SAVE
THE HOWLING OF THE WIND AND NO MOVEMENT BUT THE SWAYING BRANCHES
ABOVE THEM
MCMURDO LISTENED AT THE DOOR OF THE LONELY HOUSE BUT ALL WAS STILL
WITHIN THEN HE LEANED THE POWDER BAG AGAINST IT RIPPED A HOLE IN IT
WITH HIS KNIFE AND ATTACHED THE FUSE WHEN IT WAS WELL ALIGHT HE AND
HIS TWO COMPANIONS TOOK TO THEIR HEELS AND WERE SOME DISTANCE OFF
SAFE AND SNUG IN A SHELTERING DITCH BEFORE THE SHATTERING ROAR OF
THE EXPLOSION WITH THE LOW DEEP RUMBLE OF THE COLLAPSING BUILDING
TOLD THEM THAT THEIR WORK WAS DONE NO CLEANER JOB HAD EVER BEEN
CARRIED OUT IN THE BLOODSTAINED ANNALS OF THE SOCIETY
BUT ALAS THAT WORK SO WELL ORGANIZED AND BOLDLY CARRIED OUT SHOULD
ALL HAVE GONE FOR NOTHING WARNED BY THE FATE OF THE VARIOUS VICTIMS
AND KNOWING THAT HE WAS MARKED DOWN FOR DESTRUCTION CHESTER WILCOX
HAD MOVED HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY ONLY THE DAY BEFORE TO SOME SAFER
AND LESS KNOWN QUARTERS WHERE A GUARD OF POLICE SHOULD WATCH OVER
THEM IT WAS AN EMPTY HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN TORN DOWN BY THE
GUNPOWDER AND THE GRIM OLD COLOUR SERGEANT OF THE WAR WAS STILL
TEACHING DISCIPLINE TO THE MINERS OF IRON DIKE
LEAVE HIM TO ME SAID MCMURDO HES MY MAN AND ILL GET HIM SURE
IF I HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR FOR HIM
A VOTE OF THANKS AND CONFIDENCE WAS PASSED IN FULL LODGE AND SO FOR
THE TIME THE MATTER ENDED WHEN A FEW WEEKS LATER IT WAS REPORTED IN
THE PAPERS THAT WILCOX HAD BEEN SHOT AT FROM AN AMBUSCADE IT WAS AN
OPEN SECRET THAT MCMURDO WAS STILL AT WORK UPON HIS UNFINISHED JOB
SUCH WERE THE METHODS OF THE SOCIETY OF FREEMEN AND SUCH WERE THE
DEEDS OF THE SCOWRERS BY WHICH THEY SPREAD THEIR RULE OF FEAR OVER
THE GREAT AND RICH DISTRICT WHICH WAS FOR SO LONG A PERIOD HAUNTED BY
THEIR TERRIBLE PRESENCE WHY SHOULD THESE PAGES BE STAINED BY FURTHER
CRIMES HAVE I NOT SAID ENOUGH TO SHOW THE MEN AND THEIR METHODS
THESE DEEDS ARE WRITTEN IN HISTORY AND THERE ARE RECORDS WHEREIN ONE
MAY READ THE DETAILS OF THEM THERE ONE MAY LEARN OF THE SHOOTING OF
POLICEMEN HUNT AND EVANS BECAUSE THEY HAD VENTURED TO ARREST TWO
MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETYA DOUBLE OUTRAGE PLANNED AT THE VERMISSA
LODGE AND CARRIED OUT IN COLD BLOOD UPON TWO HELPLESS AND DISARMED
MEN THERE ALSO ONE MAY READ OF THE SHOOTING OF MRS LARBEY WHEN SHE
WAS NURSING HER HUSBAND WHO HAD BEEN BEATEN ALMOST TO DEATH BY
ORDERS OF BOSS MCGINTY THE KILLING OF THE ELDER JENKINS SHORTLY
FOLLOWED BY THAT OF HIS BROTHER THE MUTILATION OF JAMES MURDOCH THE
BLOWING UP OF THE STAPHOUSE FAMILY AND THE MURDER OF THE STENDALS
ALL FOLLOWED HARD UPON ONE ANOTHER IN THE SAME TERRIBLE WINTER
DARKLY THE SHADOW LAY UPON THE VALLEY OF FEAR THE SPRING HAD COME
WITH RUNNING BROOKS AND BLOSSOMING TREES THERE WAS HOPE FOR ALL
NATURE BOUND SO LONG IN AN IRON GRIP BUT NOWHERE WAS THERE ANY HOPE
FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO LIVED UNDER THE YOKE OF THE TERROR NEVER
HAD THE CLOUD ABOVE THEM BEEN SO DARK AND HOPELESS AS IN THE EARLY
SUMMER OF THE YEAR CHAPTER VI
DANGER
IT WAS THE HEIGHT OF THE REIGN OF TERROR MCMURDO WHO HAD ALREADY
BEEN APPOINTED INNER DEACON WITH EVERY PROSPECT OF SOME DAY
SUCCEEDING MCGINTY AS BODYMASTER WAS NOW SO NECESSARY TO THE
COUNCILS OF HIS COMRADES THAT NOTHING WAS DONE WITHOUT HIS HELP AND
ADVICE THE MORE POPULAR HE BECAME HOWEVER WITH THE FREEMEN THE
BLACKER WERE THE SCOWLS WHICH GREETED HIM AS HE PASSED ALONG THE
STREETS OF VERMISSA IN SPITE OF THEIR TERROR THE CITIZENS WERE
TAKING HEART TO BAND THEMSELVES TOGETHER AGAINST THEIR OPPRESSORS
RUMOURS HAD REACHED THE LODGE OF SECRET GATHERINGS IN THE HERALD
OFFICE AND OF DISTRIBUTION OF FIREARMS AMONG THE LAWABIDING PEOPLE
BUT MCGINTY AND HIS MEN WERE UNDISTURBED BY SUCH REPORTS THEY WERE
NUMEROUS RESOLUTE AND WELL ARMED THEIR OPPONENTS WERE SCATTERED
AND POWERLESS IT WOULD ALL END AS IT HAD DONE IN THE PAST IN
AIMLESS TALK AND POSSIBLY IN IMPOTENT ARRESTS SO SAID MCGINTY
MCMURDO AND ALL THE BOLDER SPIRITS
IT WAS A SATURDAY EVENING IN MAY SATURDAY WAS ALWAYS THE LODGE
NIGHT AND MCMURDO WAS LEAVING HIS HOUSE TO ATTEND IT WHEN MORRIS
THE WEAKER BROTHER OF THE ORDER CAME TO SEE HIM HIS BROW WAS
CREASED WITH CARE AND HIS KINDLY FACE WAS DRAWN AND HAGGARD
CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU FREELY MR MCMURDO

SAFE IVE A SECRET HERE HE PUT HIS HAND TO HIS BREAST AND IT IS
JUST BURNING THE LIFE OUT OF ME I WISH IT HAD COME TO ANY ONE OF YOU
BUT ME IF I TELL IT IT WILL MEAN MURDER FOR SURE IF I DONT IT

BE MURDERED ID NEVER REST EASY AGAIN AND YET ITS OUR OWN NECKS
THAT MAY BE AT STAKE IN GODS NAME WHAT SHALL I DO HE ROCKED TO
AND FRO IN HIS AGONY OF INDECISION
BUT HIS WORDS HAD MOVED MCMURDO DEEPLY IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT HE
SHARED THE OTHERS OPINION AS TO THE DANGER AND THE NEED FOR MEETING
IT HE GRIPPED MORRISS SHOULDER AND SHOOK HIM IN HIS EARNESTNESS

EXCITEMENT YOU WONT GAIN ANYTHING BY SITTING KEENING LIKE AN OLD

MY HANDS HE GROANED
SELFPROTECTION IS NO MURDER ANYHOW SAID MCMURDO SMILING GRIMLY
ITS HIM OR US I GUESS THIS MAN WOULD DESTROY US ALL IF WE LEFT HIM
LONG IN THE VALLEY WHY BROTHER MORRIS WELL HAVE TO ELECT YOU
BODYMASTER YET FOR YOUVE SURELY SAVED THE LODGE
AND YET IT WAS CLEAR FROM HIS ACTIONS THAT HE THOUGHT MORE SERIOUSLY
OF THIS NEW INTRUSION THAN HIS WORDS WOULD SHOW IT MAY HAVE BEEN HIS
GUILTY CONSCIENCE IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE REPUTATION OF THE PINKERTON
ORGANIZATION IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT GREAT RICH
CORPORATIONS HAD SET THEMSELVES THE TASK OF CLEARING OUT THE
SCOWRERS BUT WHATEVER HIS REASON HIS ACTIONS WERE THOSE OF A MAN
WHO IS PREPARING FOR THE WORST EVERY PAPER WHICH WOULD INCRIMINATE
HIM WAS DESTROYED BEFORE HE LEFT THE HOUSE AFTER THAT HE GAVE A LONG
SIGH OF SATISFACTION FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS SAFE AND YET

SOMEWHAT EASED IN MIND NOW THAT HIS OWN PREPARATIONS FOR ESCAPE HAD
BEEN BEGUN MCMURDO WENT ON TO THE LODGE IT HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
AND ONLY BY COMPLICATED SIGNS AND COUNTERSIGNS COULD HE PASS THROUGH
THE OUTER GUARD AND INNER GUARD WHO CLOSETILED IT A BUZZ OF
PLEASURE AND WELCOME GREETED HIM AS HE ENTERED THE LONG ROOM WAS
CROWDED AND THROUGH THE HAZE OF TOBACCO SMOKE HE SAW THE TANGLED
BLACK MANE OF THE BODYMASTER THE CRUEL UNFRIENDLY FEATURES OF
BALDWIN THE VULTURE FACE OF HARRAWAY THE SECRETARY AND A DOZEN
MORE WHO WERE AMONG THE LEADERS OF THE LODGE HE REJOICED THAT THEY
SHOULD ALL BE THERE TO TAKE COUNSEL OVER HIS NEWS
INDEED ITS GLAD WE ARE TO SEE YOU BROTHER CRIED THE CHAIRMAN
THERES BUSINESS HERE THAT WANTS A SOLOMON IN JUDGMENT TO SET IT
RIGHT
ITS LANDER AND EGAN EXPLAINED HIS NEIGHBOUR AS HE TOOK HIS SEAT
THEY BOTH CLAIM THE HEAD MONEY GIVEN BY THE LODGE FOR THE SHOOTING
OF OLD MAN CRABBE OVER AT STYLESTOWN AND WHOS TO SAY WHICH FIRED
THE BULLET
MCMURDO ROSE IN HIS PLACE AND RAISED HIS HAND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS
FACE FROZE THE ATTENTION OF THE AUDIENCE THERE WAS A DEAD HUSH OF
EXPECTATION
EMINENT BODYMASTER HE SAID IN A SOLEMN VOICE I CLAIM URGENCY
BROTHER MCMURDO CLAIMS URGENCY SAID MCGINTY ITS A CLAIM THAT BY
THE RULES OF THIS LODGE TAKES PRECEDENCE NOW BROTHER WE ATTEND
YOU
MCMURDO TOOK THE LETTER FROM HIS POCKET
EMINENT BODYMASTER AND BRETHREN HE SAID I AM THE BEARER OF ILL
NEWS THIS DAY BUT IT IS BETTER THAT IT SHOULD BE KNOWN AND
DISCUSSED THAN THAT A BLOW SHOULD FALL UPON US WITHOUT WARNING WHICH
WOULD DESTROY US ALL I HAVE INFORMATION THAT THE MOST POWERFUL AND
RICHEST ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS STATE HAVE BOUND THEMSELVES TOGETHER
FOR OUR DESTRUCTION AND THAT AT THIS VERY MOMENT THERE IS A
PINKERTON DETECTIVE ONE BIRDY EDWARDS AT WORK IN THE VALLEY
COLLECTING THE EVIDENCE WHICH MAY PUT A ROPE ROUND THE NECKS OF MANY
OF US AND SEND EVERY MAN IN THIS ROOM INTO A FELONS CELL THAT IS
THE SITUATION FOR THE DISCUSSION OF WHICH I HAVE MADE A CLAIM OF
URGENCY
THERE WAS A DEAD SILENCE IN THE ROOM IT WAS BROKEN BY THE CHAIRMAN
WHAT IS YOUR EVIDENCE FOR THIS BROTHER MCMURDO HE ASKED
IT IS IN THIS LETTER WHICH HAS COME INTO MY HANDS SAID MCMURDO HE
READ THE PASSAGE ALOUD IT IS A MATTER OF HONOUR WITH ME THAT I CAN
GIVE NO FURTHER PARTICULARS ABOUT THE LETTER NOR PUT IT INTO YOUR
HANDS BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT THERE IS NOTHING ELSE IN IT WHICH CAN
AFFECT THE INTERESTS OF THE LODGE I PUT THE CASE BEFORE YOU AS IT
HAS REACHED ME
LET ME SAY MR CHAIRMAN SAID ONE OF THE OLDER BRETHREN THAT I
HAVE HEARD OF BIRDY EDWARDS AND THAT HE HAS THE NAME OF BEING THE
BEST MAN IN THE PINKERTON SERVICE
DOES ANYONE KNOW HIM BY SIGHT ASKED MCGINTY
YES SAID MCMURDO I DO
THERE WAS A MURMUR OF ASTONISHMENT THROUGH THE HALL
I BELIEVE WE HOLD HIM IN THE HOLLOW OF OUR HANDS HE CONTINUED WITH
AN EXULTING SMILE UPON HIS FACE IF WE ACT QUICKLY AND WISELY WE
CAN CUT THIS THING SHORT IF I HAVE YOUR CONFIDENCE AND YOUR HELP IT
IS LITTLE THAT WE HAVE TO FEAR
WHAT HAVE WE TO FEAR ANYHOW WHAT CAN HE KNOW OF OUR AFFAIRS
YOU MIGHT SAY SO IF ALL WERE AS STANCH AS YOU COUNCILLOR BUT THIS
MAN HAS ALL THE MILLIONS OF THE CAPITALISTS AT HIS BACK DO YOU THINK
THERE IS NO WEAKER BROTHER AMONG ALL OUR LODGES THAT COULD NOT BE
BOUGHT HE WILL GET AT OUR SECRETSMAYBE HAS GOT THEM ALREADY
THERES ONLY ONE SURE CURE
THAT HE NEVER LEAVES THE VALLEY SAID BALDWIN
MCMURDO NODDED GOOD FOR YOU BROTHER BALDWIN HE SAID YOU AND I
HAVE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES BUT YOU HAVE SAID THE TRUE WORD TONIGHT
WHERE IS HE THEN WHERE SHALL WE KNOW HIM
EMINENT BODYMASTER SAID MCMURDO EARNESTLY I WOULD PUT IT TO YOU
THAT THIS IS TOO VITAL A THING FOR US TO DISCUSS IN OPEN LODGE GOD
FORBID THAT I SHOULD THROW A DOUBT ON ANYONE HERE BUT IF SO MUCH AS
A WORD OF GOSSIP GOT TO THE EARS OF THIS MAN THERE WOULD BE AN END
OF ANY CHANCE OF OUR GETTING HIM I WOULD ASK THE LODGE TO CHOOSE A
TRUSTY COMMITTEE MR CHAIRMANYOURSELF IF I MIGHT SUGGEST IT AND
BROTHER BALDWIN HERE AND FIVE MORE THEN I CAN TALK FREELY OF WHAT I
KNOW AND OF WHAT I ADVISE SHOULD BE DONE
THE PROPOSITION WAS AT ONCE ADOPTED AND THE COMMITTEE CHOSEN
BESIDES THE CHAIRMAN AND BALDWIN THERE WERE THE VULTUREFACED
SECRETARY HARRAWAY TIGER CORMAC THE BRUTAL YOUNG ASSASSIN CARTER
THE TREASURER AND THE BROTHERS WILLABY FEARLESS AND DESPERATE MEN
WHO WOULD STICK AT NOTHING
THE USUAL REVELRY OF THE LODGE WAS SHORT AND SUBDUED FOR THERE WAS A
CLOUD UPON THE MENS SPIRITS AND MANY THERE FOR THE FIRST TIME BEGAN
TO SEE THE CLOUD OF AVENGING LAW DRIFTING UP IN THAT SERENE SKY UNDER
WHICH THEY HAD DWELT SO LONG THE HORRORS THEY HAD DEALT OUT TO
OTHERS HAD BEEN SO MUCH A PART OF THEIR SETTLED LIVES THAT THE
THOUGHT OF RETRIBUTION HAD BECOME A REMOTE ONE AND SO SEEMED THE
MORE STARTLING NOW THAT IT CAME SO CLOSELY UPON THEM THEY BROKE UP
EARLY AND LEFT THEIR LEADERS TO THEIR COUNCIL
NOW MCMURDO SAID MCGINTY WHEN THEY WERE ALONE THE SEVEN MEN SAT
FROZEN IN THEIR SEATS
I SAID JUST NOW THAT I KNEW BIRDY EDWARDS MCMURDO EXPLAINED I
NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT HE IS NOT HERE UNDER THAT NAME HES A BRAVE
MAN BUT NOT A CRAZY ONE HE PASSES UNDER THE NAME OF STEVE WILSON
AND HE IS LODGING AT HOBSONS PATCH

TIME NOR WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A SECOND THOUGHT BUT FOR THIS LETTER

CHAPTER VII
THE TRAPPING OF BIRDY EDWARDS
AS MCMURDO HAD SAID THE HOUSE IN WHICH HE LIVED WAS A LONELY ONE AND
VERY WELL SUITED FOR SUCH A CRIME AS THEY HAD PLANNED IT WAS ON THE
EXTREME FRINGE OF THE TOWN AND STOOD WELL BACK FROM THE ROAD IN ANY
OTHER CASE THE CONSPIRATORS WOULD HAVE SIMPLY CALLED OUT THEIR MAN
AS THEY HAD MANY A TIME BEFORE AND EMPTIED THEIR PISTOLS INTO HIS
BODY BUT IN THIS INSTANCE IT WAS VERY NECESSARY TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH
HE KNEW HOW HE KNEW IT AND WHAT HAD BEEN PASSED ON TO HIS
EMPLOYERS
IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THEY WERE ALREADY TOO LATE AND THAT THE WORK HAD
BEEN DONE IF THAT WAS INDEED SO THEY COULD AT LEAST HAVE THEIR
REVENGE UPON THE MAN WHO HAD DONE IT BUT THEY WERE HOPEFUL THAT
NOTHING OF GREAT IMPORTANCE HAD YET COME TO THE DETECTIVES
KNOWLEDGE AS OTHERWISE THEY ARGUED HE WOULD NOT HAVE TROUBLED TO
WRITE DOWN AND FORWARD SUCH TRIVIAL INFORMATION AS MCMURDO CLAIMED TO
HAVE GIVEN HIM HOWEVER ALL THIS THEY WOULD LEARN FROM HIS OWN LIPS
ONCE IN THEIR POWER THEY WOULD FIND A WAY TO MAKE HIM SPEAK IT WAS
NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY HAD HANDLED AN UNWILLING WITNESS
MCMURDO WENT TO HOBSONS PATCH AS AGREED THE POLICE SEEMED TO TAKE
PARTICULAR INTEREST IN HIM THAT MORNING AND CAPTAIN MARVINHE WHO
HAD CLAIMED THE OLD ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM AT CHICAGOACTUALLY
ADDRESSED HIM AS HE WAITED AT THE STATION MCMURDO TURNED AWAY AND
REFUSED TO SPEAK WITH HIM HE WAS BACK FROM HIS MISSION IN THE
AFTERNOON AND SAW MCGINTY AT THE UNION HOUSE
HE IS COMING HE SAID
GOOD SAID MCGINTY THE GIANT WAS IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES WITH CHAINS
AND SEALS GLEAMING ATHWART HIS AMPLE WAISTCOAT AND A DIAMOND
TWINKLING THROUGH THE FRINGE OF HIS BRISTLING BEARD DRINK AND
POLITICS HAD MADE THE BOSS A VERY RICH AS WELL AS POWERFUL MAN THE
MORE TERRIBLE THEREFORE SEEMED THAT GLIMPSE OF THE PRISON OR THE
GALLOWS WHICH HAD RISEN BEFORE HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE
DO YOU RECKON HE KNOWS MUCH HE ASKED ANXIOUSLY
MCMURDO SHOOK HIS HEAD GLOOMILY HES BEEN HERE SOME TIMESIX WEEKS
AT THE LEAST I GUESS HE DIDNT COME INTO THESE PARTS TO LOOK AT THE
PROSPECT IF HE HAS BEEN WORKING AMONG US ALL THAT TIME WITH THE
RAILROAD MONEY AT HIS BACK I SHOULD EXPECT THAT HE HAS GOT RESULTS
AND THAT HE HAS PASSED THEM ON
THERES NOT A WEAK MAN IN THE LODGE CRIED MCGINTY TRUE AS STEEL
EVERY MAN OF THEM AND YET BY THE LORD THERE IS THAT SKUNK MORRIS
WHAT ABOUT HIM IF ANY MAN GIVES US AWAY IT WOULD BE HE IVE A MIND
TO SEND A COUPLE OF THE BOYS ROUND BEFORE EVENING TO GIVE HIM A
BEATING UP AND SEE WHAT THEY CAN GET FROM HIM
WELL THERE WOULD BE NO HARM IN THAT MCMURDO ANSWERED I WONT
DENY THAT I HAVE A LIKING FOR MORRIS AND WOULD BE SORRY TO SEE HIM
COME TO HARM HE HAS SPOKEN TO ME ONCE OR TWICE OVER LODGE MATTERS
AND THOUGH HE MAY NOT SEE THEM THE SAME AS YOU OR I HE NEVER SEEMED
THE SORT THAT SQUEALS BUT STILL IT IS NOT FOR ME TO STAND BETWEEN
HIM AND YOU
ILL FIX THE OLD DEVIL SAID MCGINTY WITH AN OATH IVE HAD MY EYE
ON HIM THIS YEAR PAST
WELL YOU KNOW BEST ABOUT THAT MCMURDO ANSWERED BUT WHATEVER YOU
DO MUST BE TOMORROW FOR WE MUST LIE LOW UNTIL THE PINKERTON AFFAIR
IS SETTLED UP WE CANT AFFORD TO SET THE POLICE BUZZING TODAY OF
ALL DAYS
TRUE FOR YOU SAID MCGINTY AND WELL LEARN FROM BIRDY EDWARDS
HIMSELF WHERE HE GOT HIS NEWS IF WE HAVE TO CUT HIS HEART OUT FIRST
DID HE SEEM TO SCENT A TRAP
MCMURDO LAUGHED I GUESS I TOOK HIM ON HIS WEAK POINT HE SAID IF
HE COULD GET ON A GOOD TRAIL OF THE SCOWRERS HES READY TO FOLLOW IT
INTO HELL I TOOK HIS MONEY MCMURDO GRINNED AS HE PRODUCED A WAD OF
DOLLAR NOTES AND AS MUCH MORE WHEN HE HAS SEEN ALL MY PAPERS
WHAT PAPERS
WELL THERE ARE NO PAPERS BUT I FILLED HIM UP ABOUT CONSTITUTIONS
AND BOOKS OF RULES AND FORMS OF MEMBERSHIP HE EXPECTS TO GET RIGHT
DOWN TO THE END OF EVERYTHING BEFORE HE LEAVES
FAITH HES RIGHT THERE SAID MCGINTY GRIMLY DIDNT HE ASK YOU
WHY YOU DIDNT BRING HIM THE PAPERS
AS IF I WOULD CARRY SUCH THINGS AND ME A SUSPECTED MAN AND CAPTAIN
MARVIN AFTER SPEAKING TO ME THIS VERY DAY AT THE DEPOT
AY I HEARD OF THAT SAID MCGINTY I GUESS THE HEAVY END OF THIS
BUSINESS IS COMING ON TO YOU WE COULD PUT HIM DOWN AN OLD SHAFT WHEN
WEVE DONE WITH HIM BUT HOWEVER WE WORK IT WE CANT GET PAST THE MAN
LIVING AT HOBSONS PATCH AND YOU BEING THERE TODAY
MCMURDO SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IF WE HANDLE IT RIGHT THEY CAN
NEVER PROVE THE KILLING SAID HE NO ONE CAN SEE HIM COME TO THE
HOUSE AFTER DARK AND ILL LAY TO IT THAT NO ONE WILL SEE HIM GO NOW
SEE HERE COUNCILLOR ILL SHOW YOU MY PLAN AND ILL ASK YOU TO FIT
THE OTHERS INTO IT YOU WILL ALL COME IN GOOD TIME VERY WELL HE
COMES AT TEN HE IS TO TAP THREE TIMES AND ME TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR
HIM THEN ILL GET BEHIND HIM AND SHUT IT HES OUR MAN THEN
THATS ALL EASY AND PLAIN
YES BUT THE NEXT STEP WANTS CONSIDERING HES A HARD PROPOSITION
HES HEAVILY ARMED IVE FOOLED HIM PROPER AND YET HE IS LIKELY TO
BE ON HIS GUARD SUPPOSE I SHOW HIM RIGHT INTO A ROOM WITH SEVEN MEN
IN IT WHERE HE EXPECTED TO FIND ME ALONE THERE IS GOING TO BE
SHOOTING AND SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BE HURT
THATS SO
AND THE NOISE IS GOING TO BRING EVERY DAMNED COPPER IN THE TOWNSHIP
ON TOP OF IT
I GUESS YOU ARE RIGHT
THIS IS HOW I SHOULD WORK IT YOU WILL ALL BE IN THE BIG ROOMSAME
AS YOU SAW WHEN YOU HAD A CHAT WITH ME ILL OPEN THE DOOR FOR HIM
SHOW HIM INTO THE PARLOUR BESIDE THE DOOR AND LEAVE HIM THERE WHILE
I GET THE PAPERS THAT WILL GIVE ME THE CHANCE OF TELLING YOU HOW
THINGS ARE SHAPING THEN I WILL GO BACK TO HIM WITH SOME FAKED
PAPERS AS HE IS READING THEM I WILL JUMP FOR HIM AND GET MY GRIP ON
HIS PISTOL ARM YOULL HEAR ME CALL AND IN YOU WILL RUSH THE QUICKER
THE BETTER FOR HE IS AS STRONG A MAN AS I AND I MAY HAVE MORE THAN
I CAN MANAGE BUT I ALLOW THAT I CAN HOLD HIM TILL YOU COME
ITS A GOOD PLAN SAID MCGINTY THE LODGE WILL OWE YOU A DEBT FOR
THIS I GUESS WHEN I MOVE OUT OF THE CHAIR I CAN PUT A NAME TO THE
MAN THATS COMING AFTER ME
SURE COUNCILLOR I AM LITTLE MORE THAN A RECRUIT SAID MCMURDO
BUT HIS FACE SHOWED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE GREAT MANS COMPLIMENT
WHEN HE HAD RETURNED HOME HE MADE HIS OWN PREPARATIONS FOR THE GRIM
EVENING IN FRONT OF HIM FIRST HE CLEANED OILED AND LOADED HIS
SMITH WESSON REVOLVER THEN HE SURVEYED THE ROOM IN WHICH THE
DETECTIVE WAS TO BE TRAPPED IT WAS A LARGE APARTMENT WITH A LONG
DEAL TABLE IN THE CENTRE AND THE BIG STOVE AT ONE SIDE AT EACH OF
THE OTHER SIDES WERE WINDOWS THERE WERE NO SHUTTERS ON THESE ONLY
LIGHT CURTAINS WHICH DREW ACROSS MCMURDO EXAMINED THESE ATTENTIVELY
NO DOUBT IT MUST HAVE STRUCK HIM THAT THE APARTMENT WAS VERY EXPOSED
FOR SO SECRET A MEETING YET ITS DISTANCE FROM THE ROAD MADE IT OF
LESS CONSEQUENCE FINALLY HE DISCUSSED THE MATTER WITH HIS FELLOW
LODGER SCANLAN THOUGH A SCOWRER WAS AN INOFFENSIVE LITTLE MAN WHO
WAS TOO WEAK TO STAND AGAINST THE OPINION OF HIS COMRADES BUT WAS
SECRETLY HORRIFIED BY THE DEEDS OF BLOOD AT WHICH HE HAD SOMETIMES
BEEN FORCED TO ASSIST MCMURDO TOLD HIM SHORTLY WHAT WAS INTENDED
AND IF I WERE YOU MIKE SCANLAN I WOULD TAKE A NIGHT OFF AND KEEP
CLEAR OF IT THERE WILL BE BLOODY WORK HERE BEFORE MORNING
WELL INDEED THEN MAC SCANLAN ANSWERED ITS NOT THE WILL BUT
THE NERVE THAT IS WANTING IN ME WHEN I SAW MANAGER DUNN GO DOWN AT
THE COLLIERY YONDER IT WAS JUST MORE THAN I COULD STAND IM NOT MADE
FOR IT SAME AS YOU OR MCGINTY IF THE LODGE WILL THINK NONE THE
WORSE OF ME ILL JUST DO AS YOU ADVISE AND LEAVE YOU TO YOURSELVES
FOR THE EVENING
THE MEN CAME IN GOOD TIME AS ARRANGED THEY WERE OUTWARDLY
RESPECTABLE CITIZENS WELL CLAD AND CLEANLY BUT A JUDGE OF FACES
WOULD HAVE READ LITTLE HOPE FOR BIRDY EDWARDS IN THOSE HARD MOUTHS
AND REMORSELESS EYES THERE WAS NOT A MAN IN THE ROOM WHOSE HANDS HAD
NOT BEEN REDDENED A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE THEY WERE AS HARDENED TO
HUMAN MURDER AS A BUTCHER TO SHEEP
FOREMOST OF COURSE BOTH IN APPEARANCE AND IN GUILT WAS THE
FORMIDABLE BOSS HARRAWAY THE SECRETARY WAS A LEAN BITTER MAN WITH
A LONG SCRAGGY NECK AND NERVOUS JERKY LIMBS A MAN OF INCORRUPTIBLE
FIDELITY WHERE THE FINANCES OF THE ORDER WERE CONCERNED AND WITH NO
NOTION OF JUSTICE OR HONESTY TO ANYONE BEYOND THE TREASURER CARTER
WAS A MIDDLEAGED MAN WITH AN IMPASSIVE RATHER SULKY EXPRESSION
AND A YELLOW PARCHMENT SKIN HE WAS A CAPABLE ORGANIZER AND THE
ACTUAL DETAILS OF NEARLY EVERY OUTRAGE HAD SPRUNG FROM HIS PLOTTING
BRAIN THE TWO WILLABYS WERE MEN OF ACTION TALL LITHE YOUNG FELLOWS
WITH DETERMINED FACES WHILE THEIR COMPANION TIGER CORMAC A HEAVY
DARK YOUTH WAS FEARED EVEN BY HIS OWN COMRADES FOR THE FEROCITY OF
HIS DISPOSITION THESE WERE THE MEN WHO ASSEMBLED THAT NIGHT UNDER
THE ROOF OF MCMURDO FOR THE KILLING OF THE PINKERTON DETECTIVE
THEIR HOST HAD PLACED WHISKY UPON THE TABLE AND THEY HAD HASTENED TO
PRIME THEMSELVES FOR THE WORK BEFORE THEM BALDWIN AND CORMAC WERE
ALREADY HALFDRUNK AND THE LIQUOR HAD BROUGHT OUT ALL THEIR
FEROCITY CORMAC PLACED HIS HANDS ON THE STOVE FOR AN INSTANTIT HAD
BEEN LIGHTED FOR THE NIGHTS WERE STILL COLD
THAT WILL DO SAID HE WITH AN OATH
AY SAID BALDWIN CATCHING HIS MEANING IF HE IS STRAPPED TO THAT
WE WILL HAVE THE TRUTH OUT OF HIM
WELL HAVE THE TRUTH OUT OF HIM NEVER FEAR SAID MCMURDO HE HAD
NERVES OF STEEL THIS MAN FOR THOUGH THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THE AFFAIR
WAS ON HIM HIS MANNER WAS AS COOL AND UNCONCERNED AS EVER THE OTHERS
MARKED IT AND APPLAUDED
YOU ARE THE ONE TO HANDLE HIM SAID THE BOSS APPROVINGLY NOT A
WARNING WILL HE GET TILL YOUR HAND IS ON HIS THROAT ITS A PITY
THERE ARE NO SHUTTERS TO YOUR WINDOWS
MCMURDO WENT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AND DREW THE CURTAINS TIGHTER
SURE NO ONE CAN SPY UPON US NOW ITS CLOSE UPON THE HOUR
MAYBE HE WONT COME MAYBE HELL GET A SNIFF OF DANGER SAID THE
SECRETARY
HELL COME NEVER FEAR MCMURDO ANSWERED HE IS AS EAGER TO COME
AS YOU CAN BE TO SEE HIM HARK TO THAT
THEY ALL SAT LIKE WAX FIGURES SOME WITH THEIR GLASSES ARRESTED
HALFWAY TO THEIR LIPS THREE LOUD KNOCKS HAD SOUNDED AT THE DOOR
HUSH MCMURDO RAISED HIS HAND IN CAUTION AN EXULTING GLANCE WENT
ROUND THE CIRCLE AND HANDS WERE LAID UPON HIDDEN WEAPONS
NOT A SOUND FOR YOUR LIVES MCMURDO WHISPERED AS HE WENT FROM THE
ROOM CLOSING THE DOOR CAREFULLY BEHIND HIM
WITH STRAINED EARS THE MURDERERS WAITED THEY COUNTED THE STEPS OF
THEIR COMRADE DOWN THE PASSAGE THEN THEY HEARD HIM OPEN THE OUTER
DOOR THERE WERE A FEW WORDS AS OF GREETING THEN THEY WERE AWARE OF
A STRANGE STEP INSIDE AND OF AN UNFAMILIAR VOICE AN INSTANT LATER
CAME THE SLAM OF THE DOOR AND THE TURNING OF THE KEY IN THE LOCK
THEIR PREY WAS SAFE WITHIN THE TRAP TIGER CORMAC LAUGHED HORRIBLY
AND BOSS MCGINTY CLAPPED HIS GREAT HAND ACROSS HIS MOUTH
BE QUIET YOU FOOL HE WHISPERED YOULL BE THE UNDOING OF US
YET
THERE WAS A MUTTER OF CONVERSATION FROM THE NEXT ROOM IT SEEMED
INTERMINABLE THEN THE DOOR OPENED AND MCMURDO APPEARED HIS FINGER
UPON HIS LIP
HE CAME TO THE END OF THE TABLE AND LOOKED ROUND AT THEM A SUBTLE
CHANGE HAD COME OVER HIM HIS MANNER WAS AS OF ONE WHO HAS GREAT WORK
TO DO HIS FACE HAD SET INTO GRANITE FIRMNESS HIS EYES SHONE WITH A
FIERCE EXCITEMENT BEHIND HIS SPECTACLES HE HAD BECOME A VISIBLE
LEADER OF MEN THEY STARED AT HIM WITH EAGER INTEREST BUT HE SAID
NOTHING STILL WITH THE SAME SINGULAR GAZE HE LOOKED FROM MAN TO MAN
WELL CRIED BOSS MCGINTY AT LAST IS HE HERE IS BIRDY EDWARDS
HERE
YES MCMURDO ANSWERED SLOWLY BIRDY EDWARDS IS HERE I AM BIRDY
EDWARDS
THERE WERE TEN SECONDS AFTER THAT BRIEF SPEECH DURING WHICH THE ROOM
MIGHT HAVE BEEN EMPTY SO PROFOUND WAS THE SILENCE THE HISSING OF A
KETTLE UPON THE STOVE ROSE SHARP AND STRIDENT TO THE EAR SEVEN WHITE
FACES ALL TURNED UPWARD TO THIS MAN WHO DOMINATED THEM WERE SET
MOTIONLESS WITH UTTER TERROR THEN WITH A SUDDEN SHIVERING OF GLASS
A BRISTLE OF GLISTENING RIFLE BARRELS BROKE THROUGH EACH WINDOW
WHILE THE CURTAINS WERE TORN FROM THEIR HANGINGS
AT THE SIGHT BOSS MCGINTY GAVE THE ROAR OF A WOUNDED BEAR AND PLUNGED
FOR THE HALFOPENED DOOR A LEVELLED REVOLVER MET HIM THERE WITH THE
STERN BLUE EYES OF CAPTAIN MARVIN OF THE MINE POLICE GLEAMING BEHIND
THE SIGHTS THE BOSS RECOILED AND FELL BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
YOURE SAFER THERE COUNCILLOR SAID THE MAN WHOM THEY HAD KNOWN AS
MCMURDO AND YOU BALDWIN IF YOU DONT TAKE YOUR HAND OFF YOUR
PISTOL YOULL CHEAT THE HANGMAN YET PULL IT OUT OR BY THE LORD
THAT MADE METHERE THAT WILL DO THERE ARE FORTY ARMED MEN ROUND
THIS HOUSE AND YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT FOR YOURSELF WHAT CHANCE YOU
HAVE TAKE THEIR PISTOLS MARVIN
THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE RESISTANCE UNDER THE MENACE OF THOSE RIFLES
THE MEN WERE DISARMED SULKY SHEEPISH AND AMAZED THEY STILL SAT
ROUND THE TABLE
ID LIKE TO SAY A WORD TO YOU BEFORE WE SEPARATE SAID THE MAN WHO
HAD TRAPPED THEM I GUESS WE MAY NOT MEET AGAIN UNTIL YOU SEE ME ON
THE STAND IN THE COURTHOUSE ILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO THINK OVER
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN YOU KNOW ME NOW FOR WHAT I AM AT LAST I CAN
PUT MY CARDS ON THE TABLE I AM BIRDY EDWARDS OF PINKERTONS I WAS
CHOSEN TO BREAK UP YOUR GANG I HAD A HARD AND DANGEROUS GAME TO
PLAY NOT A SOUL NOT ONE SOUL NOT MY NEAREST AND DEAREST KNEW THAT
I WAS PLAYING IT ONLY CAPTAIN MARVIN HERE AND MY EMPLOYERS KNEW
THAT BUT ITS OVER TONIGHT THANK GOD AND I AM THE WINNER
THE SEVEN PALE RIGID FACES LOOKED UP AT HIM THERE WAS UNAPPEASABLE
HATRED IN THEIR EYES HE READ THE RELENTLESS THREAT
MAYBE YOU THINK THAT THE GAME IS NOT OVER YET WELL I TAKE MY
CHANCE OF THAT ANYHOW SOME OF YOU WILL TAKE NO FURTHER HAND AND
THERE ARE SIXTY MORE BESIDES YOURSELVES THAT WILL SEE A JAIL THIS
NIGHT ILL TELL YOU THIS THAT WHEN I WAS PUT UPON THIS JOB I NEVER
BELIEVED THERE WAS SUCH A SOCIETY AS YOURS I THOUGHT IT WAS PAPER

THE FREEMEN SO I WENT TO CHICAGO AND WAS MADE ONE THEN I WAS SURER
THAN EVER THAT IT WAS JUST PAPER TALK FOR I FOUND NO HARM IN THE
SOCIETY BUT A DEAL OF GOOD
STILL I HAD TO CARRY OUT MY JOB AND I CAME TO THE COAL VALLEYS
WHEN I REACHED THIS PLACE I LEARNED THAT I WAS WRONG AND THAT IT
WASNT A DIME NOVEL AFTER ALL SO I STAYED TO LOOK AFTER IT I NEVER
KILLED A MAN IN CHICAGO I NEVER MINTED A DOLLAR IN MY LIFE THOSE I
GAVE YOU WERE AS GOOD AS ANY OTHERS BUT I NEVER SPENT MONEY BETTER
BUT I KNEW THE WAY INTO YOUR GOOD WISHES AND SO I PRETENDED TO YOU
THAT THE LAW WAS AFTER ME IT ALL WORKED JUST AS I THOUGHT
SO I JOINED YOUR INFERNAL LODGE AND I TOOK MY SHARE IN YOUR
COUNCILS MAYBE THEY WILL SAY THAT I WAS AS BAD AS YOU THEY CAN SAY
WHAT THEY LIKE SO LONG AS I GET YOU BUT WHAT IS THE TRUTH THE
NIGHT I JOINED YOU BEAT UP OLD MAN STANGER I COULD NOT WARN HIM FOR

KILLED HIM IF EVER I HAVE SUGGESTED THINGS SO AS TO KEEP MY PLACE
AMONG YOU THEY WERE THINGS WHICH I KNEW I COULD PREVENT I COULD NOT
SAVE DUNN AND MENZIES FOR I DID NOT KNOW ENOUGH BUT I WILL SEE THAT
THEIR MURDERERS ARE HANGED I GAVE CHESTER WILCOX WARNING SO THAT
WHEN I BLEW HIS HOUSE IN HE AND HIS FOLK WERE IN HIDING THERE WAS
MANY A CRIME THAT I COULD NOT STOP BUT IF YOU LOOK BACK AND THINK
HOW OFTEN YOUR MAN CAME HOME THE OTHER ROAD OR WAS DOWN IN TOWN WHEN

BE LEFT AT THE ADDRESS OF MISS ETTIE SHAFTER A MISSION WHICH HE HAD
ACCEPTED WITH A WINK AND A KNOWING SMILE IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE
MORNING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND A MUCH MUFFLED MAN BOARDED A SPECIAL
TRAIN WHICH HAD BEEN SENT BY THE RAILROAD COMPANY AND MADE A SWIFT
UNBROKEN JOURNEY OUT OF THE LAND OF DANGER IT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT
EVER EITHER ETTIE OR HER LOVER SET FOOT IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR TEN
DAYS LATER THEY WERE MARRIED IN CHICAGO WITH OLD JACOB SHAFTER AS
WITNESS OF THE WEDDING
THE TRIAL OF THE SCOWRERS WAS HELD FAR FROM THE PLACE WHERE THEIR
ADHERENTS MIGHT HAVE TERRIFIED THE GUARDIANS OF THE LAW IN VAIN THEY
STRUGGLED IN VAIN THE MONEY OF THE LODGEMONEY SQUEEZED BY
BLACKMAIL OUT OF THE WHOLE COUNTRYSIDEWAS SPENT LIKE WATER IN THE
ATTEMPT TO SAVE THEM THAT COLD CLEAR UNIMPASSIONED STATEMENT FROM

LAST HOUR CAME EIGHT OF HIS CHIEF FOLLOWERS SHARED HIS FATE

ANOTHER HAND TO BE PLAYED AND YET ANOTHER AND ANOTHER TED BALDWIN
FOR ONE HAD ESCAPED THE SCAFFOLD SO HAD THE WILLABYS SO HAD
SEVERAL OTHERS OF THE FIERCEST SPIRITS OF THE GANG FOR TEN YEARS

A CHANGED NAME TO CALIFORNIA AND IT WAS THERE THAT THE LIGHT WENT
FOR A TIME OUT OF HIS LIFE WHEN ETTIE EDWARDS DIED ONCE AGAIN HE WAS
NEARLY KILLED AND ONCE AGAIN UNDER THE NAME OF DOUGLAS HE WORKED IN
A LONELY CANYON WHERE WITH AN ENGLISH PARTNER NAMED BARKER HE
AMASSED A FORTUNE AT LAST THERE CAME A WARNING TO HIM THAT THE
BLOODHOUNDS WERE ON HIS TRACK ONCE MORE AND HE CLEAREDONLY JUST IN
TIMEFOR ENGLAND AND THENCE CAME THE JOHN DOUGLAS WHO FOR A SECOND
TIME MARRIED A WORTHY MATE AND LIVED FOR FIVE YEARS AS A SUSSEX
COUNTY GENTLEMAN A LIFE WHICH ENDED WITH THE STRANGE HAPPENINGS OF
WHICH WE HAVE HEARD
CHAPTER VIII
EPILOGUE
THE POLICE TRIAL HAD PASSED IN WHICH THE CASE OF JOHN DOUGLAS WAS
REFERRED TO A HIGHER COURT SO HAD THE QUARTER SESSIONS AT WHICH HE
WAS ACQUITTED AS HAVING ACTED IN SELFDEFENSE

ESCAPED THERE IS NO SAFETY FOR YOUR HUSBAND IN ENGLAND
TWO MONTHS HAD GONE BY AND THE CASE HAD TO SOME EXTENT PASSED FROM
OUR MINDS THEN ONE MORNING THERE CAME AN ENIGMATIC NOTE SLIPPED INTO
OUR LETTER BOX DEAR ME MR HOLMES DEAR ME SAID THIS SINGULAR
EPISTLE THERE WAS NEITHER SUPERSCRIPTION NOR SIGNATURE I LAUGHED AT
THE QUAINT MESSAGE BUT HOLMES SHOWED UNWONTED SERIOUSNESS
DEVILTRY WATSON HE REMARKED AND SAT LONG WITH A CLOUDED BROW
LATE LAST NIGHT MRS HUDSON OUR LANDLADY BROUGHT UP A MESSAGE THAT
A GENTLEMAN WISHED TO SEE HOLMES AND THAT THE MATTER WAS OF THE
UTMOST IMPORTANCE CLOSE AT THE HEELS OF HIS MESSENGER CAME CECIL
BARKER OUR FRIEND OF THE MOATED MANOR HOUSE HIS FACE WAS DRAWN AND

IS NO CASE OF SAWEDOFF SHOTGUNS AND CLUMSY SIXSHOOTERS YOU CAN
TELL AN OLD MASTER BY THE SWEEP OF HIS BRUSH I CAN TELL A MORIARTY
WHEN I SEE ONE THIS CRIME IS FROM LONDON NOT FROM AMERICA
BUT FOR WHAT MOTIVE
BECAUSE IT IS DONE BY A MAN WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO FAILONE WHOSE
WHOLE UNIQUE POSITION DEPENDS UPON THE FACT THAT ALL HE DOES MUST
SUCCEED A GREAT BRAIN AND A HUGE ORGANIZATION HAVE BEEN TURNED TO
THE EXTINCTION OF ONE MAN IT IS CRUSHING THE NUT WITH THE HAMMERAN
ABSURD EXTRAVAGANCE OF ENERGYBUT THE NUT IS VERY EFFECTUALLY
CRUSHED ALL THE SAME
HOW CAME THIS MAN TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT THE FIRST WORD THAT EVER CAME TO US OF THE
BUSINESS WAS FROM ONE OF HIS LIEUTENANTS THESE AMERICANS WERE WELL
ADVISED HAVING AN ENGLISH JOB TO DO THEY TOOK INTO PARTNERSHIP AS
ANY FOREIGN CRIMINAL COULD DO THIS GREAT CONSULTANT IN CRIME FROM
THAT MOMENT THEIR MAN WAS DOOMED AT FIRST HE WOULD CONTENT HIMSELF
BY USING HIS MACHINERY IN ORDER TO FIND THEIR VICTIM THEN HE WOULD
INDICATE HOW THE MATTER MIGHT BE TREATED FINALLY WHEN HE READ IN
THE REPORTS OF THE FAILURE OF THIS AGENT HE WOULD STEP IN HIMSELF
WITH A MASTER TOUCH YOU HEARD ME WARN THIS MAN AT BIRLSTONE MANOR
HOUSE THAT THE COMING DANGER WAS GREATER THAN THE PAST WAS I RIGHT
BARKER BEAT HIS HEAD WITH HIS CLENCHED FIST IN HIS IMPOTENT ANGER
DO YOU TELL ME THAT WE HAVE TO SIT DOWN UNDER THIS DO YOU SAY THAT
NO ONE CAN EVER GET LEVEL WITH THIS KINGDEVIL

LOOKING FAR INTO THE FUTURE I DONT SAY THAT HE CANT BE BEAT BUT

STILL STRAINED TO PIERCE THE VEIL

PREFACE
THE FRIENDS OF MR SHERLOCK HOLMES WILL BE GLAD TO LEARN THAT HE IS
STILL ALIVE AND WELL THOUGH SOMEWHAT CRIPPLED BY OCCASIONAL ATTACKS
OF RHEUMATISM HE HAS FOR MANY YEARS LIVED IN A SMALL FARM UPON THE
DOWNS FIVE MILES FROM EASTBOURNE WHERE HIS TIME IS DIVIDED BETWEEN
PHILOSOPHY AND AGRICULTURE DURING THIS PERIOD OF REST HE HAS REFUSED
THE MOST PRINCELY OFFERS TO TAKE UP VARIOUS CASES HAVING DETERMINED
THAT HIS RETIREMENT WAS A PERMANENT ONE THE APPROACH OF THE GERMAN
WAR CAUSED HIM HOWEVER TO LAY HIS REMARKABLE COMBINATION OF
INTELLECTUAL AND PRACTICAL ACTIVITY AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE
GOVERNMENT WITH HISTORICAL RESULTS WHICH ARE RECOUNTED IN HIS LAST

CHAPTER I
THE SINGULAR EXPERIENCE OF MR JOHN SCOTT ECCLES
I FIND IT RECORDED IN MY NOTEBOOK THAT IT WAS A BLEAK AND WINDY DAY
TOWARDS THE END OF MARCH IN THE YEAR HOLMES HAD RECEIVED A
TELEGRAM WHILE WE SAT AT OUR LUNCH AND HE HAD SCRIBBLED A REPLY HE
MADE NO REMARK BUT THE MATTER REMAINED IN HIS THOUGHTS FOR HE STOOD
IN FRONT OF THE FIRE AFTERWARDS WITH A THOUGHTFUL FACE SMOKING HIS
PIPE AND CASTING AN OCCASIONAL GLANCE AT THE MESSAGE SUDDENLY HE
TURNED UPON ME WITH A MISCHIEVOUS TWINKLE IN HIS EYES
I SUPPOSE WATSON WE MUST LOOK UPON YOU AS A MAN OF LETTERS SAID
HE HOW DO YOU DEFINE THE WORD GROTESQUE
STRANGEREMARKABLE I SUGGESTED
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AT MY DEFINITION
THERE IS SURELY SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT SAID HE SOME UNDERLYING
SUGGESTION OF THE TRAGIC AND THE TERRIBLE IF YOU CAST YOUR MIND
BACK TO SOME OF THOSE NARRATIVES WITH WHICH YOU HAVE AFFLICTED A
LONGSUFFERING PUBLIC YOU WILL RECOGNIZE HOW OFTEN THE GROTESQUE HAS
DEEPENED INTO THE CRIMINAL THINK OF THAT LITTLE AFFAIR OF THE
REDHEADED MEN THAT WAS GROTESQUE ENOUGH IN THE OUTSET AND YET IT
ENDED IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT AT ROBBERY OR AGAIN THERE WAS THAT

MY DEAR WATSON YOU KNOW HOW BORED I HAVE BEEN SINCE WE LOCKED UP

TO PIECES BECAUSE IT IS NOT CONNECTED UP WITH THE WORK FOR WHICH IT
WAS BUILT LIFE IS COMMONPLACE THE PAPERS ARE STERILE AUDACITY AND
ROMANCE SEEM TO HAVE PASSED FOREVER FROM THE CRIMINAL WORLD CAN YOU
ASK ME THEN WHETHER I AM READY TO LOOK INTO ANY NEW PROBLEM
HOWEVER TRIVIAL IT MAY PROVE BUT HERE UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN IS OUR
CLIENT
A MEASURED STEP WAS HEARD UPON THE STAIRS AND A MOMENT LATER A
STOUT TALL GRAYWHISKERED AND SOLEMNLY RESPECTABLE PERSON WAS
USHERED INTO THE ROOM HIS LIFE HISTORY WAS WRITTEN IN HIS HEAVY
FEATURES AND POMPOUS MANNER FROM HIS SPATS TO HIS GOLDRIMMED
SPECTACLES HE WAS A CONSERVATIVE A CHURCHMAN A GOOD CITIZEN
ORTHODOX AND CONVENTIONAL TO THE LAST DEGREE BUT SOME AMAZING
EXPERIENCE HAD DISTURBED HIS NATIVE COMPOSURE AND LEFT ITS TRACES IN
HIS BRISTLING HAIR HIS FLUSHED ANGRY CHEEKS AND HIS FLURRIED
EXCITED MANNER HE PLUNGED INSTANTLY INTO HIS BUSINESS
I HAVE HAD A MOST SINGULAR AND UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE MR HOLMES
SAID HE NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I BEEN PLACED IN SUCH A SITUATION IT
IS MOST IMPROPERMOST OUTRAGEOUS I MUST INSIST UPON SOME
EXPLANATION HE SWELLED AND PUFFED IN HIS ANGER
PRAY SIT DOWN MR SCOTT ECCLES SAID HOLMES IN A SOOTHING VOICE
MAY I ASK IN THE FIRST PLACE WHY YOU CAME TO ME AT ALL
WELL SIR IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE A MATTER WHICH CONCERNED THE
POLICE AND YET WHEN YOU HAVE HEARD THE FACTS YOU MUST ADMIT THAT I
COULD NOT LEAVE IT WHERE IT WAS PRIVATE DETECTIVES ARE A CLASS WITH
WHOM I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO SYMPATHY BUT NONE THE LESS HAVING HEARD
YOUR NAME
QUITE SO BUT IN THE SECOND PLACE WHY DID YOU NOT COME AT ONCE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HOLMES GLANCED AT HIS WATCH
IT IS A QUARTERPAST TWO HE SAID YOUR TELEGRAM WAS DISPATCHED
ABOUT ONE BUT NO ONE CAN GLANCE AT YOUR TOILET AND ATTIRE WITHOUT
SEEING THAT YOUR DISTURBANCE DATES FROM THE MOMENT OF YOUR WAKING
OUR CLIENT SMOOTHED DOWN HIS UNBRUSHED HAIR AND FELT HIS UNSHAVEN
CHIN
YOU ARE RIGHT MR HOLMES I NEVER GAVE A THOUGHT TO MY TOILET I
WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO GET OUT OF SUCH A HOUSE BUT I HAVE BEEN RUNNING
ROUND MAKING INQUIRIES BEFORE I CAME TO YOU I WENT TO THE HOUSE
AGENTS YOU KNOW AND THEY SAID THAT MR GARCIAS RENT WAS PAID UP
ALL RIGHT AND THAT EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER AT WISTERIA LODGE
COME COME SIR SAID HOLMES LAUGHING YOU ARE LIKE MY FRIEND
DR WATSON WHO HAS A BAD HABIT OF TELLING HIS STORIES WRONG END
FOREMOST PLEASE ARRANGE YOUR THOUGHTS AND LET ME KNOW IN THEIR DUE
SEQUENCE EXACTLY WHAT THOSE EVENTS ARE WHICH HAVE SENT YOU OUT
UNBRUSHED AND UNKEMPT WITH DRESS BOOTS AND WAISTCOAT BUTTONED AWRY
IN SEARCH OF ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE
OUR CLIENT LOOKED DOWN WITH A RUEFUL FACE AT HIS OWN UNCONVENTIONAL
APPEARANCE
IM SURE IT MUST LOOK VERY BAD MR HOLMES AND I AM NOT AWARE THAT
IN MY WHOLE LIFE SUCH A THING HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE BUT WILL TELL
YOU THE WHOLE QUEER BUSINESS AND WHEN I HAVE DONE SO YOU WILL ADMIT
I AM SURE THAT THERE HAS BEEN ENOUGH TO EXCUSE ME
BUT HIS NARRATIVE WAS NIPPED IN THE BUD THERE WAS A BUSTLE OUTSIDE
AND MRS HUDSON OPENED THE DOOR TO USHER IN TWO ROBUST AND
OFFICIALLOOKING INDIVIDUALS ONE OF WHOM WAS WELL KNOWN TO US AS
INSPECTOR GREGSON OF SCOTLAND YARD AN ENERGETIC GALLANT AND
WITHIN HIS LIMITATIONS A CAPABLE OFFICER HE SHOOK HANDS WITH HOLMES
AND INTRODUCED HIS COMRADE AS INSPECTOR BAYNES OF THE SURREY
CONSTABULARY
WE ARE HUNTING TOGETHER MR HOLMES AND OUR TRAIL LAY IN THIS
DIRECTION HE TURNED HIS BULLDOG EYES UPON OUR VISITOR ARE YOU MR
JOHN SCOTT ECCLES OF POPHAM HOUSE LEE
I AM
WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING YOU ABOUT ALL THE MORNING
YOU TRACED HIM THROUGH THE TELEGRAM NO DOUBT SAID HOLMES EXACTLY MR
HOLMES WE PICKED UP THE SCENT AT CHARING CROSS
POSTOFFICE AND CAME ON HERE
BUT WHY DO YOU FOLLOW ME WHAT DO YOU WANT
WE WISH A STATEMENT MR SCOTT ECCLES AS TO THE EVENTS WHICH LET UP
TO THE DEATH LAST NIGHT OF MR ALOYSIUS GARCIA OF WISTERIA LODGE
NEAR ESHER
OUR CLIENT HAD SAT UP WITH STARING EYES AND EVERY TINGE OF COLOUR
STRUCK FROM HIS ASTONISHED FACE
DEAD DID YOU SAY HE WAS DEAD
YES SIR HE IS DEAD
BUT HOW AN ACCIDENT
MURDER IF EVER THERE WAS ONE UPON EARTH
GOOD GOD THIS IS AWFUL YOU DONT MEANYOU DONT MEAN THAT I AM
SUSPECTED
A LETTER OF YOURS WAS FOUND IN THE DEAD MANS POCKET AND WE KNOW BY
IT THAT YOU HAD PLANNED TO PASS LAST NIGHT AT HIS HOUSE
SO I DID
OH YOU DID DID YOU
OUT CAME THE OFFICIAL NOTEBOOK
WAIT A BIT GREGSON SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES ALL YOU DESIRE IS A
PLAIN STATEMENT IS IT NOT
AND IT IS MY DUTY TO WARN MR SCOTT ECCLES THAT IT MAY BE USED
AGAINST HIM
MR ECCLES WAS GOING TO TELL US ABOUT IT WHEN YOU ENTERED THE ROOM
I THINK WATSON A BRANDY AND SODA WOULD DO HIM NO HARM NOW SIR I
SUGGEST THAT YOU TAKE NO NOTICE OF THIS ADDITION TO YOUR AUDIENCE
AND THAT YOU PROCEED WITH YOUR NARRATIVE EXACTLY AS YOU WOULD HAVE
DONE HAD YOU NEVER BEEN INTERRUPTED
OUR VISITOR HAD GULPED OFF THE BRANDY AND THE COLOUR HAD RETURNED TO
HIS FACE WITH A DUBIOUS GLANCE AT THE INSPECTORS NOTEBOOK HE
PLUNGED AT ONCE INTO HIS EXTRAORDINARY STATEMENT
I AM A BACHELOR SAID HE AND BEING OF A SOCIABLE TURN I CULTIVATE
A LARGE NUMBER OF FRIENDS AMONG THESE ARE THE FAMILY OF A RETIRED
BREWER CALLED MELVILLE LIVING AT ABERMARLE MANSION KENSINGTON IT
WAS AT HIS TABLE THAT I MET SOME WEEKS AGO A YOUNG FELLOW NAMED
GARCIA HE WAS I UNDERSTOOD OF SPANISH DESCENT AND CONNECTED IN
SOME WAY WITH THE EMBASSY HE SPOKE PERFECT ENGLISH WAS PLEASING IN
HIS MANNERS AND AS GOODLOOKING A MAN AS EVER I SAW IN MY LIFE
IN SOME WAY WE STRUCK UP QUITE A FRIENDSHIP THIS YOUNG FELLOW AND
I HE SEEMED TO TAKE A FANCY TO ME FROM THE FIRST AND WITHIN TWO
DAYS OF OUR MEETING HE CAME TO SEE ME AT LEE ONE THING LED TO
ANOTHER AND IT ENDED IN HIS INVITING ME OUT TO SPEND A FEW DAYS AT
HIS HOUSE WISTERIA LODGE BETWEEN ESHER AND OXSHOTT YESTERDAY
EVENING I WENT TO ESHER TO FULFIL THIS ENGAGEMENT
HE HAD DESCRIBED HIS HOUSEHOLD TO ME BEFORE I WENT THERE HE LIVED
WITH A FAITHFUL SERVANT A COUNTRYMAN OF HIS OWN WHO LOOKED AFTER
ALL HIS NEEDS THIS FELLOW COULD SPEAK ENGLISH AND DID HIS
HOUSEKEEPING FOR HIM THEN THERE WAS A WONDERFUL COOK HE SAID A
HALFBREED WHOM HE HAD PICKED UP IN HIS TRAVELS WHO COULD SERVE AN
EXCELLENT DINNER I REMEMBER THAT HE REMARKED WHAT A QUEER HOUSEHOLD
IT WAS TO FIND IN THE HEART OF SURREY AND THAT I AGREED WITH HIM
THOUGH IT HAS PROVED A GOOD DEAL QUEERER THAN I THOUGHT
I DROVE TO THE PLACEABOUT TWO MILES ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF ESHER
THE HOUSE WAS A FAIRSIZED ONE STANDING BACK FROM THE ROAD WITH A
CURVING DRIVE WHICH WAS BANKED WITH HIGH EVERGREEN SHRUBS IT WAS AN
OLD TUMBLEDOWN BUILDING IN A CRAZY STATE OF DISREPAIR WHEN THE TRAP
PULLED UP ON THE GRASSGROWN DRIVE IN FRONT OF THE BLOTCHED AND
WEATHERSTAINED DOOR I HAD DOUBTS AS TO MY WISDOM IN VISITING A MAN
WHOM I KNEW SO SLIGHTLY HE OPENED THE DOOR HIMSELF HOWEVER AND
GREETED ME WITH A GREAT SHOW OF CORDIALITY I WAS HANDED OVER TO THE
MANSERVANT A MELANCHOLY SWARTHY INDIVIDUAL WHO LED THE WAY MY BAG
IN HIS HAND TO MY BEDROOM THE WHOLE PLACE WAS DEPRESSING OUR
DINNER WAS TTE TTE AND THOUGH MY HOST DID HIS BEST TO BE
ENTERTAINING HIS THOUGHTS SEEMED TO CONTINUALLY WANDER AND HE
TALKED SO VAGUELY AND WILDLY THAT I COULD HARDLY UNDERSTAND HIM HE
CONTINUALLY DRUMMED HIS FINGERS ON THE TABLE GNAWED HIS NAILS AND
GAVE OTHER SIGNS OF NERVOUS IMPATIENCE THE DINNER ITSELF WAS NEITHER
WELL SERVED NOR WELL COOKED AND THE GLOOMY PRESENCE OF THE TACITURN
SERVANT DID NOT HELP TO ENLIVEN US I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT MANY TIMES
IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING I WISHED THAT I COULD INVENT SOME EXCUSE
WHICH WOULD TAKE ME BACK TO LEE
ONE THING COMES BACK TO MY MEMORY WHICH MAY HAVE A BEARING UPON THE
BUSINESS THAT YOU TWO GENTLEMEN ARE INVESTIGATING I THOUGHT NOTHING
OF IT AT THE TIME NEAR THE END OF DINNER A NOTE WAS HANDED IN BY THE
SERVANT I NOTICED THAT AFTER MY HOST HAD READ IT HE SEEMED EVEN MORE
DISTRAIT AND STRANGE THAN BEFORE HE GAVE UP ALL PRETENCE AT
CONVERSATION AND SAT SMOKING ENDLESS CIGARETTES LOST IN HIS OWN
THOUGHTS BUT HE MADE NO REMARK AS TO THE CONTENTS ABOUT ELEVEN I
WAS GLAD TO GO TO BED SOME TIME LATER GARCIA LOOKED IN AT MY
DOORTHE ROOM WAS DARK AT THE TIMEAND ASKED ME IF I HAD RUNG I
SAID THAT I HAD NOT HE APOLOGIZED FOR HAVING DISTURBED ME SO LATE
SAYING THAT IT WAS NEARLY ONE OCLOCK I DROPPED OFF AFTER THIS AND
SLEPT SOUNDLY ALL NIGHT
AND NOW I COME TO THE AMAZING PART OF MY TALE WHEN I WOKE IT WAS
BROAD DAYLIGHT I GLANCED AT MY WATCH AND THE TIME WAS NEARLY NINE
I HAD PARTICULARLY ASKED TO BE CALLED AT EIGHT SO I WAS VERY MUCH
ASTONISHED AT THIS FORGETFULNESS I SPRANG UP AND RANG FOR THE
SERVANT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE I RANG AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH THE SAME
RESULT THEN I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE BELL WAS OUT OF ORDER
I HUDDLED ON MY CLOTHES AND HURRIED DOWNSTAIRS IN AN EXCEEDINGLY BAD
TEMPER TO ORDER SOME HOT WATER YOU CAN IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN I
FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO ONE THERE I SHOUTED IN THE HALL THERE WAS
NO ANSWER THEN I RAN FROM ROOM TO ROOM ALL WERE DESERTED MY HOST
HAD SHOWN ME WHICH WAS HIS BEDROOM THE NIGHT BEFORE SO I KNOCKED AT
THE DOOR NO REPLY I TURNED THE HANDLE AND WALKED IN THE ROOM WAS
EMPTY AND THE BED HAD NEVER BEEN SLEPT IN HE HAD GONE WITH THE
REST THE FOREIGN HOST THE FOREIGN FOOTMAN THE FOREIGN COOK ALL
HAD VANISHED IN THE NIGHT THAT WAS THE END OF MY VISIT TO WISTERIA
LODGE
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS RUBBING HIS HANDS AND CHUCKLING AS HE ADDED THIS
BIZARRE INCIDENT TO HIS COLLECTION OF STRANGE EPISODES
YOUR EXPERIENCE IS SO FAR AS I KNOW PERFECTLY UNIQUE SAID HE
MAY I ASK SIR WHAT YOU DID THEN
I WAS FURIOUS MY FIRST IDEA WAS THAT I HAD BEEN THE VICTIM OF SOME
ABSURD PRACTICAL JOKE I PACKED MY THINGS BANGED THE HALL DOOR
BEHIND ME AND SET OFF FOR ESHER WITH MY BAG IN MY HAND I CALLED AT
ALLAN BROTHERS THE CHIEF LAND AGENTS IN THE VILLAGE AND FOUND THAT
IT WAS FROM THIS FIRM THAT THE VILLA HAD BEEN RENTED IT STRUCK ME
THAT THE WHOLE PROCEEDING COULD HARDLY BE FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING A
FOOL OF ME AND THAT THE MAIN OBJET MUST BE TO GET OUT OF THE RENT
IT IS LATE IN MARCH SO QUARTERDAY IS AT HAND BUT THIS THEORY WOULD
NOT WORK THE AGENT WAS OBLIGED TO ME FOR MY WARNING BUT TOLD ME
THAT THE RENT HAD BEEN PAID IN ADVANCE THEN I MADE MY WAY TO TOWN
AND CALLED AT THE SPANISH EMBASSY THE MAN WAS UNKNOWN THERE AFTER
THIS I WENT TO SEE MELVILLE AT WHOSE HOUSE I HAD FIRST MET GARCIA
BUT I FOUND THAT HE REALLY KNEW RATHER LESS ABOUT HIM THAN I DID
FINALLY WHEN I GOT YOUR REPLY TO MY WIRE I CAME OUT TO YOU SINCE I
GATHER THAT YOU ARE A PERSON WHO GIVES ADVICE IN DIFFICULT CASES BUT
NOW MR INSPECTOR I UNDERSTAND FROM WHAT YOU SAID WHEN YOU ENTERED
THE ROOM THAT YOU CAN CARRY THE STORY ON AND THAT SOME TRAGEDY HAD
OCCURRED I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT EVERY WORD I HAVE SAID IS THE TRUTH
AND THAT OUTSIDE OF WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU I KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
ABOUT THE FATE OF THIS MAN MY ONLY DESIRE IS TO HELP THE LAW IN
EVERY POSSIBLE WAY
I AM SURE OF IT MR SCOTT ECCLESI AM SURE OF IT SAID INSPECTOR
GREGSON IN A VERY AMIABLE TONE I AM BOUND TO SAY THAT EVERYTHING
WHICH YOU HAVE SAID AGREES VERY CLOSELY WITH THE FACTS AS THEY HAVE
COME TO OUR NOTICE FOR EXAMPLE THERE WAS THAT NOTE WHICH ARRIVED
DURING DINNER DID YOU CHANCE TO OBSERVE WHAT BECAME OF IT
YES I DID GARCIA ROLLED IT UP AND THREW IT INTO THE FIRE
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT MR BAYNES
THE COUNTRY DETECTIVE WAS A STOUT PUFFY RED MAN WHOSE FACE WAS
ONLY REDEEMED FROM GROSSNESS BY TWO EXTRAORDINARILY BRIGHT EYES
ALMOST HIDDEN BEHIND THE HEAVY CREASES OF CHEEK AND BROW WITH A SLOW
SMILE HE DREW A FOLDED AND DISCOLOURED SCRAP OF PAPER FROM HIS
POCKET
IT WAS A DOGGRATE MR HOLMES AND HE OVERPITCHED IT I PICKED THIS
OUT UNBURNED FROM THE BACK OF IT
HOLMES SMILED HIS APPRECIATION
YOU MUST HAVE EXAMINED THE HOUSE VERY CAREFULLY TO FIND A SINGLE
PELLET OF PAPER
I DID MR HOLMES ITS MY WAY SHALL I READ IT MR GREGSON
THE LONDONER NODDED
THE NOTE IS WRITTEN UPON ORDINARY CREAMLAID PAPER WITHOUT
WATERMARK IT IS A QUARTERSHEET THE PAPER IS CUT OFF IN TWO SNIPS
WITH A SHORTBLADED SCISSORS IT HAS BEEN FOLDED OVER THREE TIMES AND
SEALED WITH PURPLE WAX PUT ON HURRIEDLY AND PRESSED DOWN WITH SOME
FLAT OVAL OBJECT IT IS ADDRESSED TO MR GARCIA WISTERIA LODGE IT
SAYS
OUR OWN COLOURS GREEN AND WHITE GREEN OPEN WHITE SHUT MAIN
STAIR FIRST CORRIDOR SEVENTH RIGHT GREEN BAIZE GODSPEED
D
IT IS A WOMANS WRITING DONE WITH A SHARPPOINTED PEN BUT THE
ADDRESS IS EITHER DONE WITH ANOTHER PEN OR BY SOMEONE ELSE IT IS
THICKER AND BOLDER AS YOU SEE
A VERY REMARKABLE NOTE SAID HOLMES GLANCING IT OVER I MUST
COMPLIMENT YOU MR BAYNES UPON YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL IN YOUR
EXAMINATION OF IT A FEW TRIFLING POINTS MIGHT PERHAPS BE ADDED THE
OVAL SEAL IS UNDOUBTEDLY A PLAIN SLEEVELINKWHAT ELSE IS OF SUCH A
SHAPE THE SCISSORS WERE BENT NAIL SCISSORS SHORT AS THE TWO SNIPS
ARE YOU CAN DISTINCTLY SEE THE SAME SLIGHT CURVE IN EACH
THE COUNTRY DETECTIVE CHUCKLED
I THOUGHT I HAD SQUEEZED ALL THE JUICE OUT OF IT BUT I SEE THERE
WAS A LITTLE OVER HE SAID IM BOUND TO SAY THAT I MAKE NOTHING OF
THE NOTE EXCEPT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ON HAND AND THAT A WOMAN
AS USUAL WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
MR SCOTT ECCLES HAD FIDGETED IN HIS SEAT DURING THIS CONVERSATION
I AM GLAD YOU FOUND THE NOTE SINCE IT CORROBORATES MY STORY SAID
HE BUT I BEG TO POINT OUT THAT I HAVE NOT YET HEARD WHAT HAS
HAPPENED TO MR GARCIA NOR WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIS HOUSEHOLD
AS TO GARCIA SAID GREGSON THAT IS EASILY ANSWERED HE WAS FOUND
DEAD THIS MORNING UPON OXSHOTT COMMON NEARLY A MILE FROM HIS HOME
HIS HEAD HAD BEEN SMASHED TO PULP BY HEAVY BLOWS OF A SANDBAG OR SOME
SUCH INSTRUMENT WHICH HAD CRUSHED RATHER THAN WOUNDED IT IS A
LONELY CORNER AND THERE IS NO HOUSE WITHIN A QUARTER OF A MILE OF
THE SPOT HE HAD APPARENTLY BEEN STRUCK DOWN FIRST FROM BEHIND BUT
HIS ASSAILANT HAD GONE ON BEATING HIM LONG AFTER HE WAS DEAD IT WAS
A MOST FURIOUS ASSAULT THERE ARE NO FOOTSTEPS NOR ANY CLUE TO THE
CRIMINALS
ROBBED
NO THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT AT ROBBERY
THIS IS VERY PAINFULVERY PAINFUL AND TERRIBLE SAID MR SCOTT
ECCLES IN A QUERULOUS VOICE BUT IT IS REALLY UNCOMMONLY HARD ON ME
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MY HOST GOING OFF UPON A NOCTURNAL EXCURSION
AND MEETING SO SAD AN END HOW DO I COME TO BE MIXED UP WITH THE
CASE
VERY SIMPLY SIR INSPECTOR BAYNES ANSWERED THE ONLY DOCUMENT
FOUND IN THE POCKET OF THE DECEASED WAS A LETTER FROM YOU SAYING THAT
YOU WOULD BE WITH HIM ON THE NIGHT OF HIS DEATH IT WAS THE ENVELOPE
OF THIS LETTER WHICH GAVE US THE DEAD MANS NAME AND ADDRESS IT WAS
AFTER NINE THIS MORNING WHEN WE REACHED HIS HOUSE AND FOUND NEITHER
YOU NOR ANYONE ELSE INSIDE IT I WIRED TO MR GREGSON TO RUN YOU DOWN
IN LONDON WHILE I EXAMINED WISTERIA LODGE THEN I CAME INTO TOWN
JOINED MR GREGSON AND HERE WE ARE
I THINK NOW SAID GREGSON RISING WE HAD BEST PUT THIS MATTER
INTO AN OFFICIAL SHAPE YOU WILL COME ROUND WITH US TO THE STATION
MR SCOTT ECCLES AND LET US HAVE YOUR STATEMENT IN WRITING
CERTAINLY I WILL COME AT ONCE BUT I RETAIN YOUR SERVICES MR
HOLMES I DESIRE YOU TO SPARE NO EXPENSE AND NO PAINS TO GET AT THE
TRUTH
MY FRIEND TURNED TO THE COUNTRY INSPECTOR
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION TO MY COLLABORATING WITH YOU
MR BAYNES
HIGHLY HONOURED SIR I AM SURE
YOU APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN VERY PROMPT AND BUSINESSLIKE IN ALL THAT YOU
HAVE DONE WAS THERE ANY CLUE MAY I ASK AS TO THE EXACT HOUR THAT
THE MAN MET HIS DEATH
HE HAD BEEN THERE SINCE ONE OCLOCK THERE WAS RAIN ABOUT THAT TIME
AND HIS DEATH HAD CERTAINLY BEEN BEFORE THE RAIN
BUT THAT IS PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE MR BAYNES CRIED OUR CLIENT
HIS VOICE IS UNMISTAKABLE I COULD SWEAR TO IT THAT IT WAS HE WHO
ADDRESSED ME IN MY BEDROOM AT THAT VERY HOUR
REMARKABLE BUT BY NO MEANS IMPOSSIBLE SAID HOLMES SMILING
YOU HAVE A CLUE ASKED GREGSON
ON THE FACE OF IT THE CASE IS NOT A VERY COMPLEX ONE THOUGH IT
CERTAINLY PRESENTS SOME NOVEL AND INTERESTING FEATURES A FURTHER
KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS IS NECESSARY BEFORE I WOULD VENTURE TO GIVE A
FINAL AND DEFINITE OPINION BY THE WAY MR BAYNES DID YOU FIND
ANYTHING REMARKABLE BESIDES THIS NOTE IN YOUR EXAMINATION OF THE
HOUSE
THE DETECTIVE LOOKED AT MY FRIEND IN A SINGULAR WAY
THERE WERE SAID HE ONE OR TWO VERY REMARKABLE THINGS PERHAPS
WHEN I HAVE FINISHED AT THE POLICESTATION YOU WOULD CARE TO COME OUT
AND GIVE ME YOUR OPINION OF THEM
IN AM ENTIRELY AT YOUR SERVICE SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES RINGING THE
BELL YOU WILL SHOW THESE GENTLEMEN OUT MRS HUDSON AND KINDLY
SEND THE BOY WITH THIS TELEGRAM HE IS TO PAY A FIVESHILLING REPLY
WE SAT FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE AFTER OUR VISITORS HAD LEFT HOLMES
SMOKED HARD WITH HIS BROWNS DRAWN DOWN OVER HIS KEEN EYES AND HIS
HEAD THRUST FORWARD IN THE EAGER WAY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MAN
WELL WATSON HE ASKED TURNING SUDDENLY UPON ME WHAT DO YOU MAKE
OF IT
I CAN MAKE NOTHING OF THIS MYSTIFICATION OF SCOTT ECCLES
BUT THE CRIME
WELL TAKEN WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MANS COMPANIONS I SHOULD
SAY THAT THEY WERE IN SOME WAY CONCERNED IN THE MURDER AND HAD FLED
FROM JUSTICE
THAT IS CERTAINLY A POSSIBLE POINT OF VIEW ON THE FACE OF IT YOU
MUST ADMIT HOWEVER THAT IT IS VERY STRANGE THAT HIS TWO SERVANTS
SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM AND SHOULD HAVE ATTACKED
HIM ON THE ONE NIGHT WHEN HE HAD A GUEST THEY HAD HIM ALONE AT THEIR
MERCY EVERY OTHER NIGHT IN THE WEEK
THEN WHY DID THEY FLY
QUITE SO WHY DID THEY FLY THERE IS A BIG FACT ANOTHER BIG FACT IS
THE REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE OF OUR CLIENT SCOTT ECCLES NOW MY DEAR
WATSON IS IT BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HUMAN INGENUITY TO FURNISH AN
EXPLANATION WHICH WOULD COVER BOTH OF THESE BIG FACTS IF IT WERE ONE
WHICH WOULD ALSO ADMIT OF THE MYSTERIOUS NOTE WITH ITS VERY CURIOUS
PHRASEOLOGY WHY THEN IT WOULD BE WORTH ACCEPTING AS A TEMPORARY
HYPOTHESIS IF THE FRESH FACTS WHICH COME TO OUR KNOWLEDGE ALL FIT
THEMSELVES INTO THE SCHEME THEN OUR HYPOTHESIS MAY GRADUALLY BECOME
A SOLUTION
BUT WHAT IS OUR HYPOTHESIS
HOLMES LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH HALFCLOSED EYES
YOU MUST ADMIT MY DEAR WATSON THAT THE IDEA OF A JOKE IS
IMPOSSIBLE THERE WERE GRAVE EVENTS AFOOT AS THE SEQUEL SHOWED AND
THE COAXING OF SCOTT ECCLES TO WISTERIA LODGE HAD SOME CONNECTION
WITH THEM
BUT WHAT POSSIBLE CONNECTION
LET US TAKE IT LINK BY LINK THERE IS ON THE FACE OF IT SOMETHING
UNNATURAL ABOUT THIS STRANGE AND SUDDEN FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE YOUNG
SPANIARD AND SCOTT ECCLES IT WAS THE FORMER WHO FORCED THE PACE HE
CALLED UPON ECCLES AT THE OTHER END OF LONDON ON THE VERY DAY AFTER
HE FIRST MET HIM AND HE KEPT IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH HIM UNTIL HE GOT
HIM DOWN TO ESHER NOW WHAT DID HE WANT WITH ECCLES WHAT COULD
ECCLES SUPPLY I SEE NO CHARM IN THE MAN HE IS NOT PARTICULARY
INTELLIGENTNOT A MAN LIKELY TO BE CONGENIAL TO A QUICKWITTED
LATIN WHY THEN WAS HE PICKED OUT FROM ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WHOM
GARCIA MET AS PARTICULARLY SUITED TO HIS PURPOSE HAS HE ANY ONE
OUTSTANDING QUALITY I SAY THAT HE HAS HE IS THE VERY TYPE OF
CONVENTIONAL BRITISH RESPECTABILITY AND THE VERY MAN AS A WITNESS TO
IMPRESS ANOTHER BRITON YOU SAW YOURSELF HOW NEITHER OF THE
INSPECTORS DREAMED OF QUESTIONING HIS STATEMENT EXTRAORDINARY AS IT
WAS
BUT WHAT WAS HE TO WITNESS
NOTHING AS THINGS TURNED OUT BUT EVERYTHING HAD THEY GONE ANOTHER
WAY THAT IS HOW I READ THE MATTER
I SEE HE MIGHT HAVE PROVED AN ALIBI
EXACTLY MY DEAR WATSON HE MIGHT HAVE PROVED AN ALIBI WE WILL
SUPPOSE FOR ARGUMENTS SAKE THAT THE HOUSEHOLD OF WISTERIA LODGE
ARE CONFEDERATES IN SOME DESIGN THE ATTEMPT WHATEVER IT MAY BE IS
TO COME OFF WE WILL SAY BEFORE ONE OCLOCK BY SOME JUGGLING OF THE
CLOCKS IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THEY MAY HAVE GOT SCOTT ECCLES TO
BED EARLIER THAN HE THOUGHT BUT IN ANY CASE IT IS LIKELY THAT WHEN
GARCIA WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO TELL HIM THAT IT WAS ONE IT WAS REALLY
NOT MORE THAN TWELVE IF GARCIA COULD DO WHATEVER HE HAD TO DO AND BE
BACK BY THE HOUR MENTIONED HE HAD EVIDENTLY A POWERFUL REPLY TO ANY
ACCUSATION HERE WAS THIS IRREPROACHABLE ENGLISHMAN READY TO SWEAR IN
ANY COURT OF LAW THAT THE ACCUSED WAS IN THE HOUSE ALL THE TIME IT
WAS AN INSURANCE AGAINST THE WORST
YES YES I SEE THAT BUT HOW ABOUT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE
OTHERS
I HAVE NOT ALL MY FACTS YET BUT I DO NOT THINK THERE ARE ANY
INSUPERABLE DIFFICULTIES STILL IT IS AN ERROR TO ARGUE IN FRONT OF
YOUR DATA YOU FIND YOURSELF INSENSIBLY TWISTING THEM ROUND TO FIT
YOUR THEORIES
AND THE MESSAGE
HOW DID IT RUN OUR OWN COLOURS GREEN AND WHITE SOUNDS LIKE
RACING GREEN OPEN WHITE SHUT THAT IS CLEARLY A SIGNAL MAIN
STAIR FIRST CORRIDOR SEVENTH RIGHT GREEN BAIZE THIS IS AN
ASSIGNATION WE MAY FIND A JEALOUS HUSBAND AT THE BOTTOM OF IT ALL
IT WAS CLEARLY A DANGEROUS QUEST SHE WOULD NOT HAVE SAID GODSPEED
HAD IT NOT BEEN SO DTHAT SHOULD BE A GUIDE
THE MAN WAS A SPANIARD I SUGGEST THAT D STANDS FOR DOLORES A
COMMON FEMALE NAME IN SPAIN
GOOD WATSON VERY GOODBUT QUITE INADMISSABLE A SPANIARD WOULD
WRITE TO A SPANIARD IN SPANISH THE WRITER OF THIS NOTE IS CERTAINLY
ENGLISH WELL WE CAN ONLY POSSESS OUR SOUL IN PATIENCE UNTIL THIS
EXCELLENT INSPECTOR COME BACK FOR US MEANWHILE WE CAN THANK OUR
LUCKY FATE WHICH HAS RESCUED US FOR A FEW SHORT HOURS FROM THE
INSUFFERABLE FATIGUES OF IDLENESS
AN ANSWER HAD ARRIVED TO HOLMESS TELEGRAM BEFORE OUR SURREY OFFICER
HAD RETURNED HOLMES READ IT AND WAS ABOUT TO PLACE IT IN HIS
NOTEBOOK WHEN HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF MY EXPECTANT FACE HE TOSSED IT
ACROSS WITH A LAUGH
WE ARE MOVING IN EXALTED CIRCLES SAID HE
THE TELEGRAM WAS A LIST OF NAMES AND ADDRESSES
LORD HARRINGBY THE DINGLE SIR GEORGE FFOLLIOTT OXSHOTT TOWERS MR
HYNES HYNES JP PURDLEY PLACE MR JAMES BAKER WILLIAMS FORTON
OLD HALL MR HENDERSON HIGH GABLE REV JOSHUA STONE NETHER
WALSLING
THIS IS A VERY OBVIOUS WAY OF LIMITING OUR FIELD OF OPERATIONS
SAID HOLMES NO DOUBT BAYNES WITH HIS METHODICAL MIND HAS ALREADY
ADOPTED SOME SIMILAR PLAN
I DONT QUITE UNDERSTAND
WELL MY DEAR FELLOW WE HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT
THE MASSAGE RECEIVED BY GARCIA AT DINNER WAS AN APPOINTMENT OR AN
ASSIGNATION NOW IF THE OBVIOUS READING OF IT IS CORRECT AND IN
ORDER TO KEEP THE TRYST ONE HAS TO ASCEND A MAIN STAIR AND SEEK THE
SEVENTH DOOR IN A CORRIDOR IT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT THE HOUSE IS A
VERY LARGE ONE IT IS EQUALLY CERTAIN THAT THIS HOUSE CANNOT BE MORE
THAN A MILE OR TWO FROM OXSHOTT SINCE GARCIA WAS WALKING IN THAT
DIRECTION AND HOPED ACCORDING TO MY READING OF THE FACTS TO BE BACK
IN WISTERIA LODGE IN TIME TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF AN ALIBI WHICH WOULD
ONLY BE VALID UP TO ONE OCLOCK AS THE NUMBER OF LARGE HOUSES CLOSE
TO OXSHOTT MUST BE LIMITED I ADOPTED THE OBVIOUS METHOD OF SENDING
TO THE AGENTS MENTIONED BY SCOTT ECCLES AND OBTAINING A LIST OF THEM
HERE THEY ARE IN THIS TELEGRAM AND THE OTHER END OF OUR TANGLED
SKEIN MUST LIE AMONG THEM
IT WAS NEARLY SIX OCLOCK BEFORE WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE PRETTY
SURREY VILLAGE OF ESHER WITH INSPECTOR BAYNES AS OUR COMPANION
HOLMES AND I HAD TAKEN THINGS FOR THE NIGHT AND FOUND COMFORTABLE
QUARTERS AT THE BULL FINALLY WE SET OUT IN THE COMPANY OF THE
DETECTIVE ON OUR VISIT TO WISTERIA LODGE IT WAS A COLD DARK MARCH
EVENING WITH A SHARP WIND AND A FINE RAIN BEATING UPON OUR FACES A
FIT SETTING FOR THE WILD COMMON OVER WHICH OUR ROAD PASSED AND THE
TRAGIC GOAL TO WHICH IT LED US
CHAPTER II
THE TIGER OF SAN PEDRO
A COLD AND MELANCHOLY WALK OF A COUPLE OF MILES BROUGHT US TO A HIGH
WOODEN GATE WHICH OPENED INTO A GLOOMY AVENUE OF CHESTNUTS THE
CURVED AND SHADOWED DRIVE LED US TO A LOW DARK HOUSE PITCHBLACK
AGAINST A SLATECOLOURED SKY FROM THE FRONT WINDOW UPON THE LEFT OF
THE DOOR THERE PEEPED A GLIMMER OF A FEEBLE LIGHT
THERES A CONSTABLE IN POSSESSION SAID BAYNES ILL KNOCK AT THE
WINDOW HE STEPPED ACROSS THE GRASS PLOT AND TAPPED WITH HIS HAND ON
THE PANE THROUGH THE FOGGED GLASS I DIMLY SAW A MAN SPRING UP FROM A
CHAIR BESIDE THE FIRE AND HEARD A SHARP CRY FROM WITHIN THE ROOM AN
INSTANT LATER A WHITEFACED HARDBREATHING POLICEMAN HAD OPENED THE
DOOR THE CANDLE WAVERING IN HIS TREMBLING HAND
WHATS THE MATTER WALTERS ASKED BAYNES SHARPLY
THE MAN MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND AGAVE A LONG
SIGH OF RELIEF
I AM GLAD YOU HAVE COME SIR IT HAS BEEN A LONG EVENING AND I
DONT THINK MY NERVE IS AS GOOD AS IT WAS
YOUR NERVE WALTERS I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT YOU HAD A NERVE IN
YOUR BODY
WELL SIR ITS THIS LONELY SILENT HOUSE AND THE QUEER THING IN THE
KITCHEN THEN WHEN YOU TAPPED AT THE WINDOW I THOUGHT IT HAD COME
AGAIN
THAT WHAT HAD COME AGAIN
THE DEVIL SIR FOR ALL I KNOW IT WAS AT THE WINDOW
WHAT WAS AT THE WINDOW AND WHEN
IT WAS JUST ABOUT TWO HOURS AGO THE LIGHT WAS JUST FADING I WAS
SITTING READING IN THE CHAIR I DONT KNOW WHAT MADE ME LOOK UP BUT
THERE WAS A FACE LOOKING IN AT ME THROUGH THE LOWER PANE LORD SIR
WHAT A FACE IT WAS ILL SEE IT IN MY DREAMS
TUT TUT WALTERS THIS IS NOT TALK FOR A POLICECONSTABLE
I KNOW SIR I KNOW BUT IT SHOOK ME SIR AND THERES NO USE TO
DENY IT IT WASNT BLACK SIR NOR WAS IT WHITE NOR ANY COLOUR THAT
I KNOW BUT A KIND OF QUEER SHADE LIKE CLAY WITH A SPLASH OF MILK IN
IT THEN THERE WAS THE SIZE OF ITIT WAS TWICE YOURS SIR AND THE
LOOK OF ITTHE GREAT STARING GOGGLE EYES AND THE LINE OF WHITE
TEETH LIKE A HUNGRY BEAST I TELL YOU SIR I COULDNT MOVE A FINGER
NOR GET MY BREATH TILL IT WHISKED AWAY AND WAS GONE OUT I RAN AND
THROUGH THE SHRUBBERY BUT THANK GOD THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
IF I DIDNT KNOW YOU WERE A GOOD MAN WALTERS I SHOULD PUT A BLACK
MARK AGAINST YOU FOR THIS IF IT WERE THE DEVIL HIMSELF A CONSTABLE
ON DUTY SHOULD NEVER THANK GOD THAT HE COULD NOT LAY HIS HANDS UPON
HIM I SUPPOSE THE WHOLE THING IS NOT A VISION AND A TOUCH OF
NERVES
THAT AT LEAST IS VERY EASILY SETTLED SAID HOLMES LIGHTING HIS
LITTLE POCKET LANTERN YES HE REPORTED AFTER A SHORT EXAMINATION
OF THE GRASS BED A NUMBER TWELVE SHOE I SHOULD SAY IF HE WAS ALL
ON THE SAME SCALE AS HIS FOOT HE MUST CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN A GIANT
WHAT BECAME OF HIM
HE SEEMS TO HAVE BROKEN THROUGH THE SHRUBBERY AND MADE FOR THE
ROAD
WELL SAID THE INSPECTOR WITH A GRAVE AND THOUGHTFUL FACE WHOEVER
HE MAY HAVE BEEN AND WHATEVER HE MAY HAVE WANTED HES GONE FOR THE
PRESENT AND WE HAVE MORE IMMEDIATE THINGS TO ATTEND TO NOW MR
HOLMES WITH YOUR PERMISSION I WILL SHOW YOU ROUND THE HOUSE
THE VARIOUS BEDROOMS AND SITTINGROOMS HAD YIELDED NOTHING TO A
CAREFUL SEARCH APPARENTLY THE TENANTS HAD BROUGHT LITTLE OR NOTHING
WITH THEM AND ALL THE FURNITURE DOWN TO THE SMALLEST DETAILS HAD
BEEN TAKEN OVER WITH THE HOUSE A GOOD DEAL OF CLOTHING WITH THE
STAMP OF MARX AND CO HIGH HOLBORN HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND
TELEGRAPHIC INQUIRIES HAD BEEN ALREADY MADE WHICH SHOWED THAT MARX
KNEW NOTHING OF HIS CUSTOMER SAVE THAT HE WAS A GOOD PAYER ODDS AND
ENDS SOME PIPES A FEW NOVELS TWO OF THEM IN SPANISH AND
OLDFASHIONED PINFIRE REVOLVER AND A GUITAR WERE AMONG THE PERSONAL
PROPERTY
NOTHING IN ALL THIS SAID BAYNES STALKING CANDLE IN HAND FROM
ROOM TO ROOM BUT NOW MR HOLMES I INVITE YOUR ATTENTION TO THE
KITCHEN
IT WAS A GLOOMY HIGHCEILINGED ROOM AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE WITH A
STRAW LITTER IN ONE CORNER WHICH SERVED APPARENTLY AS A BED FOR THE
COOK THE TABLE WAS PILED WITH HALFEATEN DISHES AND DIRTY PLATES
THE DEBRIS OF LAST NIGHTS DINNER
LOOK AT THIS SAID BAYNES WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
HE HELD UP HIS CANDLE BEFORE AN EXTRAORDINARY OBJECT WHICH STOOD AT
THE BACK OF THE DRESSER IT WAS SO WRINKLED AND SHRUNKEN AND WITHERED
THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE COULD BUT
SAY THAT IT WAS BLACK AND LEATHERY AND THAT IT BORE SOME RESEMBLANCE
TO A DWARFISH HUMAN FIGURE AT FIRST AS I EXAMINED IT I THOUGHT
THAT IT WAS A MUMMIFIED NEGRO BABY AND THEN IT SEEMED A VERY TWISTED
AND ANCIENT MONKEY FINALLY I WAS LEFT IN DOUBT AS TO WHETHER IT WAS
ANIMAL OR HUMAN A DOUBLE BAND OF WHITE SHELLS WERE STRUNG ROUND THE
CENTRE OF IT
VERY INTERESTINGVERY INTERESTING INDEED SAID HOLMES PEERING AT
THIS SINISTER RELIC ANYTHING MORE
IN SILENCE BAYNES LED THE WAY TO THE SINK AND HELD FORWARD HIS
CANDLE THE LIMBS AND BODY OF SOME LARGE WHITE BIRD TORN SAVAGELY
TO PIECES WITH THE FEATHERS STILL ON WERE LITTERED ALL OVER IT
HOLMES POINTED TO THE WATTLES ON THE SEVERED HEAD
A WHITE COCK SAID HE MOST INTERESTING IT IS REALLY A VERY
CURIOUS CASE
BUT MR BAYNES HAD KEPT HIS MOST SINISTER EXHIBIT TO THE LAST FROM
UNDER THE SINK HE DREW A ZINC PAIL WHICH CONTAINED A QUANTITY OF
BLOOD THEN FROM THE TABLE HE TOOK A PLATTER HEAPED WITH SMALL PIECES
OF CHARRED BONE
SOMETHING HAS BEEN KILLED AND SOMETHING HAS BEEN BURNED WE RAKED
ALL THESE OUT OF THE FIRE WE HAD A DOCTOR IN THIS MORNING HE SAYS
THAT THEY ARE NOT HUMAN
HOLMES SMILED AND RUBBED HIS HANDS
I MUST CONGRATULATE YOU INSPECTOR ON HANDLING SO DISTINCTIVE AND
INSTRUCTIVE A CASE YOUR POWERS IF I MAY SAY SO WITHOUT OFFENCE
SEEM SUPERIOR TO YOUR OPPORTUNITIES
INSPECTOR BAYNESS SMALL EYES TWINKLED WITH PLEASURE
YOURE RIGHT MR HOLMES WE STAGNATE IN THE PROVINCES A CASE OF
THIS SORT GIVES A MAN A CHANCE AND I HOPE THAT I SHALL TAKE IT WHAT
DO YOU MAKE OF THESE BONES
A LAMB I SHOULD SAY OR A KID
AND THE WHITE COCK
CURIOUS MR BAYNES VERY CURIOUS I SHOULD SAY ALMOST UNIQUE
YES SIR THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME VERY STRANGE PEOPLE WITH SOME
VERY STRANGE WAYS IN THIS HOUSE ONE OF THEM IS DEAD DID HIS
COMPANIONS FOLLOW HIM AND KILL HIM IF THEY DID WE SHOULD HAVE THEM
FOR EVERY PORT IS WATCHED BUT MY OWN VIEWS ARE DIFFERENT YES SIR
MY OWN VIEWS ARE VERY DIFFERENT
YOU HAVE A THEORY THEN
AND ILL WORK IT MYSELF MR HOLMES ITS ONLY DUE TO MY OWN CREDIT
TO DO SO YOUR NAME IS MADE BUT I HAVE STILL TO MAKE MINE I SHOULD
BE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SAY AFTERWARDS THAT I HAD SOLVED IT WITHOUT
YOUR HELP
HOLMES LAUGHED GOODHUMOREDLY
WELL WELL INSPECTOR SAID HE DO YOU FOLLOW YOUR PATH AND I WILL
FOLLOW MINE MY RESULTS ARE ALWAYS VERY MUCH AT YOUR SERVICE IF YOU
CARE TO APPLY TO ME FOR THEM I THINK THAT I HAVE SEEN ALL THAT I
WISH IN THIS HOUSE AND THAT MY TIME MAY BE MORE PROFITABLY EMPLOYED
ELSEWHERE AU REVOIR AND GOOD LUCK
I COULD TELL BY NUMEROUS SUBTLE SIGNS WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOST
UPON ANYONE BUT MYSELF THAT HOLMES WAS ON A HOT SCENT AS IMPASSIVE
AS EVER TO THE CASUAL OBSERVER THERE WERE NONE THE LESS A SUBDUED
EAGERNESS AND SUGGESTION OF TENSION IN HIS BRIGHTENED EYES AND
BRISKER MANNER WHICH ASSURED ME THAT THE GAME WAS AFOOT AFTER HIS
HABIT HE SAID NOTHING AND AFTER MINE I ASKED NO QUESTIONS
SUFFICIENT FOR ME TO SHARE THE SPORT AND LEND MY HUMBLE HELP TO THE
CAPTURE WITHOUT DISTRACTING THAT INTENT BRAIN WITH NEEDLESS
INTERRUPTION ALL WOULD COME ROUND TO ME IN DUE TIME
I WAITED THEREFOREBUT TO MY EVERDEEPENING DISAPPOINTMENT I WAITED
IN VAIN DAY SUCCEEDED DAY AND MY FRIEND TOOK NO STEP FORWARD ONE
MORNING HE SPENT IN TOWN AND I LEARNED FROM A CASUAL REFERENCE THAT
HE HAD VISITED THE BRITISH MUSEUM SAVE FOR THIS ONE EXCURSION HE
SPENT HIS DAYS IN LONG AND OFTEN SOLITARY WALKS OR IN CHATTING WITH
A NUMBER OF VILLAGE GOSSIPS WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE HE HAD CULTIVATED
IM SURE WATSON A WEEK IN THE COUNTRY WILL BE INVALUABLE TO YOU
HE REMARKED IT IS VERY PLEASANT TO SEE THE FIRST GREEN SHOOTS UPON
THE HEDGES AND THE CATKINS ON THE HAZELS ONCE AGAIN WITH A SPUD A
TIN BOX AND AN ELEMENTARY BOOK ON BOTANY THERE ARE INSTRUCTIVE DAYS
TO BE SPENT HE PROWLED ABOUT WITH THIS EQUIPMENT HIMSELF BUT IT
WAS A POOR SHOW OF PLANTS WHICH HE WOULD BRING BACK OF AN EVENING
OCCASIONALLY IN OUR RAMBLES WE CAME ACROSS INSPECTOR BAYNES HIS FAT
RED FACE WREATHED ITSELF IN SMILES AND HIS SMALL EYES GLITTERED AS HE
GREETED MY COMPANION HE SAID LITTLE ABOUT THE CASE BUT FROM THAT
LITTLE WE GATHERED THAT HE ALSO WAS NOT DISSATISFIED AT THE COURSE OF
EVENTS I MUST ADMIT HOWEVER THAT I WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISED WHEN
SOME FIVE DAYS AFTER THE CRIME I OPENED MY MORNING PAPER TO FIND IN
LARGE LETTERS
THE OXSHOTT MYSTERY
A SOLUTION
ARREST OF SUPPOSED ASSASSIN
HOLMES SPRANG IN HIS CHAIR AS IF HE HAD BEEN STUNG WHEN I READ THE
HEADLINES
BY JOVE HE CRIED YOU DONT MEAN THAT BAYNES HAS GOT HIM
APPARENTLY SAID I AS I READ THE FOLLOWING REPORT
GREAT EXCITEMENT WAS CAUSED IN ESHER AND THE NEIGHBOURING DISTRICT
WHEN IT WAS LEARNED LATE LAST NIGHT THAT AN ARREST HAD BEEN EFFECTED
IN CONNECTION WITH THE OXSHOTT MURDER IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT MR
GARCIA OF WISTERIA LODGE WAS FOUND DEAD ON OXSHOTT COMMON HIS BODY
SHOWING SIGNS OF EXTREME VIOLENCE AND THAT ON THE SAME NIGHT HIS
SERVANT AND HIS COOK FLED WHICH APPEARED TO SHOW THEIR PARTICIPATION
IN THE CRIME IT WAS SUGGESTED BUT NEVER PROVED THAT THE DECEASED
GENTLEMAN MAY HAVE HAD VALUABLES IN THE HOUSE AND THAT THEIR
ABSTRACTION WAS THE MOTIVE OF THE CRIME EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE BY
INSPECTOR BAYNES WHO HAS THE CASE IN HAND TO ASCERTAIN THE HIDING
PLACE OF THE FUGITIVES AND HE HAD GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY
HAD NOT GONE FAR BUT WERE LURKING IN SOME RETREAT WHICH HAD BEEN
ALREADY PREPARED IT WAS CERTAIN FROM THE FIRST HOWEVER THAT THEY
WOULD EVENTUALLY BE DETECTED AS THE COOK FROM THE EVIDENCE OF ONE
OR TWO TRADESPEOPLE WHO HAVE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HIM THROUGH THE
WINDOW WAS A MAN OF MOST REMARKABLE APPEARANCEBEING A HUGE AND
HIDEOUS MULATTO WITH YELLOWISH FEATURES OF A PRONOUNCED NEGROID
TYPE THIS MAN HAS BEEN SEEN SINCE THE CRIME FOR HE WAS DETECTED AND
PURSUED BY CONSTABLE WALTERS ON THE SAME EVENING WHEN HE HAD THE
AUDACITY TO REVISIT WISTERIA LODGE INSPECTOR BAYNES CONSIDERING
THAT SUCH A VISIT MUST HAVE SOME PURPOSE IN VIEW AND WAS LIKELY
THEREFORE TO BE REPEATED ABANDONED THE HOUSE BUT LEFT AN AMBUSCADE
IN THE SHRUBBERY THE MAN WALKED INTO THE TRAP AND WAS CAPTURED LAST
NIGHT AFTER A STRUGGLE IN WHICH CONSTABLE DOWNING WAS BADLY BITTEN BY
THE SAVAGE WE UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THE PRISON IS BROUGHT BEFORE THE
MAGISTRATES A REMAND WILL BE APPLIED FOR BY THE POLICE AND THAT
GREAT DEVELOPMENTS ARE HOPED FROM HIS CAPTURE
REALLY WE MUST SEE BAYNES AT ONCE CRIED HOLMES PICKING UP HIS
HAT WE WILL JUST CATCH HIM BEFORE HE STARTS WE HURRIED DOWN THE
VILLAGE STREET AND FOUND AS WE HAD EXPECTED THAT THE INSPECTOR WAS
JUST LEAVING HIS LODGINGS
YOUVE SEEN THE PAPER MR HOLMES HE ASKED HOLDING ONE OUT TO US
YES BAYNES IVE SEEN IT PRAY DONT THINK IT A LIBERTY IF I GIVE
YOU A WORD OF FRIENDLY WARNING
OF WARNING MR HOLMES
I HAVE LOOKED INTO THIS CASE WITH SOME CARE AND I AM NOT CONVINCED
THAT YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT LINES I DONT WANT YOU TO COMMIT YOURSELF
TOO FAR UNLESS YOU ARE SURE
YOURE VERY KIND MR HOLMES
I ASSURE YOU I SPEAK FOR YOUR GOOD
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SOMETHING LIKE A WINK QUIVERED FOR AN INSTANT
OVER ONE OF MR BAYNESS TINY EYES
WE AGREED TO WORK ON OUR OWN LINES MR HOLMES THATS WHAT I AM
DOING
OH VERY GOOD SAID HOLMES DONT BLAME ME
NO SIR I BELIEVE YOU MEAN WELL BY ME BUT WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN
SYSTEMS MR HOLMES YOU HAVE YOURS AND MAYBE I HAVE MINE
LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT
YOURE WELCOME ALWAYS TO MY NEWS THIS FELLOW IS A PERFECT SAVAGE
AS STRONG AS A CARTHORSE AND AS FIERCE AS THE DEVIL HE CHEWED
DOWNINGS THUMB NEARLY OFF BEFORE THEY COULD MASTER HIM HE HARDLY
SPEAKS A WORD OF ENGLISH AND WE CAN GET NOTHING OUT OF HIM BUT
GRUNTS
AND YOU THINK YOU HAVE EVIDENCE THAT HE MURDERED HIS LATE MASTER
I DIDNT SAY SO MR HOLMES I DIDNT SAY SO WE ALL HAVE OUR LITTLE
WAYS YOU TRY YOURS AND I WILL TRY MINE THATS THE AGREEMENT
HOLMES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AS WE WALKED AWAY TOGETHER I CANT
MAKE THE MAN OUT HE SEEMS TO BE RIDING FOR A FALL WELL AS HE SAYS
WE MUST EACH TRY OUR OWN WAY AND SEE WHAT COMES OF IT BUT THERES
SOMETHING IN INSPECTOR BAYNES WHICH I CANT QUITE UNDERSTAND
JUST SIT DOWN IN THAT CHAIR WATSON SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN WE
HAD RETURNED TO OUR APARTMENT AT THE BULL I WANT TO PUT YOU IN
TOUCH WITH THE SITUATION AS I MAY NEED YOUR HELP TONIGHT LET ME
SHOW YOU THE EVOLUTION OF THIS CASE SO FAR AS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
FOLLOW IT SIMPLE AS IT HAS BEEN IN ITS LEADING FEATURES IT HAS NONE
THE LESS PRESENTED SURPRISING DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF AN ARREST
THERE ARE GAPS IN THAT DIRECTION WHICH WE HAVE STILL TO FILL
WE WILL GO BACK TO THE NOTE WHICH WAS HANDED IN TO GARCIA UPON THE
EVENING OF HIS DEATH WE MAY PUT ASIDE THIS IDEA OF BAYNESS THAT
GARCIAS SERVANTS WERE CONCERNED IN THE MATTER THE PROOF OF THIS
LIES IN THE FACT THAT IT WAS HE WHO HAD ARRANGED FOR THE PRESENCE OF
SCOTT ECCLES WHICH COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN DONE FOR THE PURPOSE OF AN
ALIBI IT WAS GARCIA THEN WHO HAD AN ENTERPRISE AND APPARENTLY A
CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE IN HAND THAT NIGHT IN THE COURSE OF WHICH HE MET
HIS DEATH I SAY CRIMINAL BECAUSE ONLY A MAN WITH A CRIMINAL
ENTERPRISE DESIRES TO ESTABLISH AN ALIBI WHO THEN IS MOST LIKELY
TO HAVE TAKEN HIS LIFE SURELY THE PERSON AGAINST WHOM THE CRIMINAL
ENTERPRISE WAS DIRECTED SO FAR IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE ARE ON SAFE
GROUND
WE CAN NOW SEE A REASON FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE OF GARCIAS HOUSEHOLD
THEY WERE ALL CONFEDERATES IN THE SAME UNKNOWN CRIME IF IT CAME OFF
WHEN GARCIA RETURNED ANY POSSIBLE SUSPICION WOULD BE WARDED OFF BY
THE ENGLISHMANS EVIDENCE AND ALL WOULD BE WELL BUT THE ATTEMPT WAS
A DANGEROUS ONE AND IF GARCIA DID NOT RETURN BY A CERTAIN HOUR IT
WAS PROBABLE THAT HIS OWN LIFE HAD BEEN SACRIFICED IT HAD BEEN
ARRANGED THEREFORE THAT IN SUCH A CASE HIS TWO SUBORDINATES WERE TO
MAKE FOR SOME PREARRANGED SPOT WHERE THEY COULD ESCAPE INVESTIGATION
AND BE IN A POSITION AFTERWARDS TO RENEW THEIR ATTEMPT THAT WOULD
FULLY EXPLAIN THE FACTS WOULD IT NOT
THE WHOLE INEXPLICABLE TANGLE SEEMED TO STRAIGHTEN OUT BEFORE ME I
WONDERED AS I ALWAYS DID HOW IT HAD NOT BEEN OBVIOUS TO ME BEFORE
BUT WHY SHOULD ONE SERVANT RETURN
WE CAN IMAGINE THAT IN THE CONFUSION OF FLIGHT SOMETHING PRECIOUS
SOMETHING WHICH HE COULD NOT BEAR TO PART WITH HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN HIS PERSISTENCE WOULD IT NOT
WELL WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP
THE NEXT STEP IS THE NOTE RECEIVED BY GARCIA AT THE DINNER IT
INDICATES A CONFEDERATE AT THE OTHER END NOW WHERE WAS THE OTHER
END I HAVE ALREADY SHOWN YOU THAT IT COULD ONLY LIE IN SOME LARGE
HOUSE AND THAT THE NUMBER OF LARGE HOUSES IS LIMITED MY FIRST DAYS
IN THIS VILLAGE WERE DEVOTED TO A SERIES OF WALKS IN WHICH IN THE
INTERVALS OF MY BOTANICAL RESEARCHES I MADE A RECONNAISSANCE OF ALL
THE LARGE HOUSES AND AN EXAMINATION OF THE FAMILY HISTORY OF THE
OCCUPANTS ONE HOUSE AND ONLY ONE RIVETED MY ATTENTION IT IS THE
FAMOUS OLD JACOBEAN GRANGE OF HIGH GABLE ONE MILE ON THE FARTHER
SIDE OF OXSHOTT AND LESS THAN HALF A MILE FROM THE SCENE OF THE
TRAGEDY THE OTHER MANSIONS BELONGED TO PROSAIC AND RESPECTABLE
PEOPLE WHO LIVE FAR ALOOF FROM ROMANCE BUT MR HENDERSON OF HIGH
GABLE WAS BY ALL ACCOUNTS A CURIOUS MAN TO WHOM CURIOUS ADVENTURES
MIGHT BEFALL I CONCENTRATED MY ATTENTION THEREFORE UPON HIM AND
HIS HOUSEHOLD
A SINGULAR SET OF PEOPLE WATSONTHE MAN HIMSELF THE MOST SINGULAR
OF THEM ALL I MANAGED TO SEE HIM ON A PLAUSIBLE PRETEXT BUT I
SEEMED TO READ IN HIS DARK DEEPSET BROODING EYES THAT HE WAS
PERFECTLY AWARE OF MY TRUE BUSINESS HE IS A MAN OF FIFTY STRONG
ACTIVE WITH IRONGRAY HAIR GREAT BUNCHED BLACK EYEBROWS THE STEP
OF A DEER AND THE AIR OF AN EMPERORA FIERCE MASTERFUL MAN WITH A
REDHOT SPIRIT BEHIND HIS PARCHMENT FACE HE IS EITHER A FOREIGNER OR
HAS LIVED LONG IN THE TROPICS FOR HE IS YELLOW AND SAPLESS BUT
TOUGH AS WHIPCORD HIS FRIEND AND SECRETARY MR LUCAS IS
UNDOUBTEDLY A FOREIGNER CHOCOLATE BROWN WILY SUAVE AND CATLIKE
WITH A POISONOUS GENTLENESS OF SPEECH YOU SEE WATSON WE HAVE COME
ALREADY UPON TWO SETS OF FOREIGNERSONE AT WISTERIA LODGE AND ONE AT
HIGH GABLESO OUR GAPS ARE BEGINNING TO CLOSE
THESE TWO MEN CLOSE AND CONFIDENTIAL FRIENDS ARE THE CENTRE OF THE
HOUSEHOLD BUT THERE IS ONE OTHER PERSON WHO FOR OUR IMMEDIATE
PURPOSE MAY BE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT HENDERSON HAS TWO CHILDRENGIRLS
OF ELEVEN AND THIRTEEN THEIR GOVERNESS IS A MISS BURNET AN
ENGLISHWOMAN OF FORTY OR THEREABOUTS THERE IS ALSO ONE CONFIDENTIAL
MANSERVANT THIS LITTLE GROUP FORMS THE REAL FAMILY FOR THEIR TRAVEL
ABOUT TOGETHER AND HENDERSON IS A GREAT TRAVELLER ALWAYS ON THE
MOVE IT IS ONLY WITHIN THE LAST WEEKS THAT HE HAS RETURNED AFTER A
YEARS ABSENCE TO HIGH GABLE I MAY ADD THAT HE IS ENORMOUSLY RICH
AND WHATEVER HIS WHIMS MAY BE HE CAN VERY EASILY SATISFY THEM FOR
THE REST HIS HOUSE IS FULL OF BUTLERS FOOTMEN MAIDSERVANTS AND
THE USUAL OVERFED UNDERWORKED STAFF OF A LARGE ENGLISH COUNTRY
HOUSE
SO MUCH I LEARNED PARTLY FROM VILLAGE GOSSIP AND PARTLY FROM MY OWN
OBSERVATION THERE ARE NO BETTER INSTRUMENTS THAN DISCHARGED SERVANTS
WITH A GRIEVANCE AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND ONE I CALL IT LUCK
BUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE COME MY WAY HAD I NOT BEEN LOOKING OUT FOR IT
AS BAYNES REMARKS WE ALL HAVE OUR SYSTEMS IT WAS MY SYSTEM WHICH
ENABLED ME TO FIND JOHN WARNER LATE GARDENER OF HIGH GABLE SACKED
IN A MOMENT OF TEMPER BY HIS IMPERIOUS EMPLOYER HE IN TURN HAD
FRIENDS AMONG THE INDOOR SERVANTS WHO UNITE IN THEIR FEAR AND DISLIKE
OF THEIR MASTER SO I HAD MY KEY TO THE SECRETS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
CURIOUS PEOPLE WATSON I DONT PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND IT ALL YET
BUT VERY CURIOUS PEOPLE ANYWAY ITS A DOUBLEWINGED HOUSE AND THE
SERVANTS LIVE ON ONE SIDE THE FAMILY ON THE OTHER THERES NO LINK
BETWEEN THE TWO SAVE FOR HENDERSONS OWN SERVANT WHO SERVES THE
FAMILYS MEALS EVERYTHING IS CARRIED TO A CERTAIN DOOR WHICH FORMS
THE ONE CONNECTION GOVERNESS AND CHILDREN HARDLY GO OUT AT ALL
EXCEPT INTO THE GARDEN HENDERSON NEVER BY ANY CHANCE WALKS ALONE
HIS DARK SECRETARY IS LIKE HIS SHADOW THE GOSSIP AMONG THE SERVANTS
IS THAT THEIR MASTER IS TERRIBLY AFRAID OF SOMETHING SOLD HIS SOUL
TO THE DEVIL IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY SAYS WARNER AND EXPECTS HIS
CREDITOR TO COME UP AND CLAIM HIS OWN WHERE THEY CAME FROM OR WHO
THEY ARE NOBODY HAS AN IDEA THEY ARE VERY VIOLENT TWICE HENDERSON
HAS LASHED AT FOLK WITH HIS DOGWHIP AND ONLY HIS LONG PURSE AND
HEAVY COMPENSATION HAVE KEPT HIM OUT OF THE COURTS
WELL NOW WATSON LET US JUDGE THE SITUATION BY THIS NEW
INFORMATION WE MAY TAKE IT THAT THE LETTER CAME OUT OF THIS STRANGE
HOUSEHOLD AND WAS AN INVITATION TO GARCIA TO CARRY OUT SOME ATTEMPT
WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN PLANNED WHO WROTE THE NOTE IT WAS SOMEONE
WITHIN THE CITADEL AND IT WAS A WOMAN WHO THEN BUT MISS BURNET THE
GOVERNESS ALL OUR REASONING SEEMS TO POINT THAT WAY AT ANY RATE WE
MAY TAKE IT AS A HYPOTHESIS AND SEE WHAT CONSEQUENCES IT WOULD
ENTAIL I MAY ADD THAT MISS BURNETS AGE AND CHARACTER MAKE IT
CERTAIN THAT MY FIRST IDEA THAT THERE MIGHT BE A LOVE INTEREST IN OUR
STORY IS OUT OF THE QUESTION
IF SHE WROTE THE NOTE SHE WAS PRESUMABLY THE FRIEND AND CONFEDERATE
OF GARCIA WHAT THEN MIGHT SHE BE EXPECTED TO DO IF SHE HEARD OF
HIS DEATH IF HE MET IT IN SOME NEFARIOUS ENTERPRISE HER LIPS MIGHT
BE SEALED STILL IN HER HEART SHE MUST RETAIN BITTERNESS AND HATRED
AGAINST THOSE WHO HAD KILLED HIM AND WOULD PRESUMABLY HELP SO FAR AS
SHE COULD TO HAVE REVENGE UPON THEM COULD WE SEE HER THEN AND TRY
TO USE HER THAT WAS MY FIRST THOUGHT BUT NOW WE COME TO A SINISTER
FACT MISS BURNET HAS NOT BEEN SEEN BY ANY HUMAN EYE SINCE THE NIGHT
OF THE MURDER FROM THAT EVENING SHE HAS UTTERLY VANISHED IS SHE
ALIVE HAS SHE PERHAPS MET HER END ON THE SAME NIGHT AS THE FRIEND
WHOM SHE HAD SUMMONED OR IS SHE MERELY A PRISONER THERE IS THE
POINT WHICH WE STILL HAVE TO DECIDE
YOU WILL APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULTY OF THE SITUATION WATSON THERE
IS NOTHING UPON WHICH WE CAN APPLY FOR A WARRANT OUR WHOLE SCHEME
MIGHT SEEM FANTASTIC IF LAID BEFORE A MAGISTRATE THE WOMANS
DISAPPEARANCE COUNTS FOR NOTHING SINCE IN THAT EXTRAORDINARY
HOUSEHOLD ANY MEMBER OF IT MIGHT BE INVISIBLE FOR A WEEK AND YET SHE
MAY AT THE PRESENT MOMENT BE IN DANGER OF HER LIFE ALL I CAN DO IS
TO WATCH THE HOUSE AND LEAVE MY AGENT WARNER ON GUARD AT THE GATES
WE CANT LET SUCH A SITUATION CONTINUE IF THE LAW CAN DO NOTHING WE
MUST TAKE THE RISK OURSELVES
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST
I KNOW WHICH IS HER ROOM IT IS ACCESSIBLE FROM THE TOP OF AN
OUTHOUSE MY SUGGESTION IS THAT YOU AND I GO TONIGHT AND SEE IF WE
CAN STRIKE AT THE VERY HEART OF THE MYSTERY
IT WAS NOT I MUST CONFESS A VERY ALLURING PROSPECT THE OLD HOUSE
WITH ITS ATMOSPHERE OF MURDER THE SINGULAR AND FORMIDABLE
INHABITANTS THE UNKNOWN DANGERS OF THE APPROACH AND THE FACT THAT
WE WERE PUTTING OURSELVES LEGALLY IN A FALSE POSITION ALL COMBINED TO
DAMP MY ARDOUR BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE ICECOLD REASONING OF
HOLMES WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SHRINK FROM ANY ADVENTURE WHICH HE
MIGHT RECOMMEND ONE KNEW THAT THUS AND ONLY THUS COULD A SOLUTION
BE FOUND I CLASPED HIS HAND IN SILENCE AND THE DIE WAS CAST
BUT IT WAS NOT DESTINED THAT OUR INVESTIGATION SHOULD HAVE SO
ADVENTUROUS AN ENDING IT WAS ABOUT FIVE OCLOCK AND THE SHADOWS OF
THE MARCH EVENING WERE BEGINNING TO FALL WHEN AN EXCITED RUSTIC
RUSHED INTO OUR ROOM
THEYVE GONE MR HOLMES THEY WENT BY THE LAST TRAIN THE LADY
BROKE AWAY AND IVE GOT HER IN A CAB DOWNSTAIRS
EXCELLENT WARNER CRIED HOLMES SPRINGING TO HIS FEET WATSON
THE GAPS ARE CLOSING RAPIDLY
IN THE CAB WAS A WOMAN HALFCOLLAPSED FROM NERVOUS EXHAUSTION SHE
BORE UPON HER AQUILINE AND EMACIATED FACE THE TRACES OF SOME RECENT
TRAGEDY HER HEAD HUNG LISTLESSLY UPON HER BREAST BUT AS SHE RAISED
IT AND TURNED HER DULL EYES UPON US I SAW THAT HER PUPILS WERE DARK
DOTS IN THE CENTRE OF THE BROAD GRAY IRIS SHE WAS DRUGGED WITH
OPIUM
I WATCHED AT THE GATE SAME AS YOU ADVISED MR HOLMES SAID OUR
EMISSARY THE DISCHARGED GARDENER WHEN THE CARRIAGE CAME OUT I
FOLLOWED IT TO THE STATION SHE WAS LIKE ONE WALKING IN HER SLEEP
BUT WHEN THEY TRIED TO GET HER INTO THE TRAIN SHE CAME TO LIFE AND
STRUGGLED THEY PUSHED HER INTO THE CARRIAGE SHE FOUGHT HER WAY OUT
AGAIN I TOOK HER PART GOT HER INTO A CAB AND HERE WE ARE I SHANT
FORGET THE FACE AT THE CARRIAGE WINDOW AS I LED HER AWAY ID HAVE A
SHORT LIFE IF HE HAD HIS WAYTHE BLACKEYED SCOWLING YELLOW
DEVIL
WE CARRIED HER UPSTAIRS LAID HER ON THE SOFA AND A COUPLE OF CUPS
OF THE STRONGEST COFFEE SOON CLEARED HER BRAIN FROM THE MISTS OF THE
DRUG BAYNES HAD BEEN SUMMONED BY HOLMES AND THE SITUATION RAPIDLY
EXPLAINED TO HIM
WHY SIR YOUVE GOT ME THE VERY EVIDENCE I WANT SAID THE
INSPECTOR WARMLY SHAKING MY FRIEND BY THE HAND I WAS ON THE SAME
SCENT AS YOU FROM THE FIRST
WHAT YOU WERE AFTER HENDERSON
WHY MR HOLMES WHEN YOU WERE CRAWLING IN THE SHRUBBERY AT HIGH
GABLE I WAS UP ONE OF THE TREES IN THE PLANTATION AND SAW YOU DOWN
BELOW IT WAS JUST WHO WOULD GET HIS EVIDENCE FIRST
THEN WHY DID YOU ARREST THE MULATTO
BAYNES CHUCKLED
I WAS SURE HENDERSON AS HE CALLS HIMSELF FELT THAT HE WAS
SUSPECTED AND THAT HE WOULD LIE LOW AND MAKE NO MOVE SO LONG AS HE
THOUGHT HE WAS IN ANY DANGER I ARRESTED THE WRONG MAN TO MAKE HIM
BELIEVE THAT OUR EYES WERE OFF HIM I KNEW HE WOULD BE LIKELY TO
CLEAR OFF THEN AND GIVE US A CHANCE OF GETTING AT MISS BURNET
HOLMES LAID HIS HAND UPON THE INSPECTORS SHOULDER
YOU WILL RISE HIGH IN YOUR PROFESSION YOU HAVE INSTINCT AND
INTUITION SAID HE
BAYNES FLUSHED WITH PLEASURE
IVE HAD A PLAINCLOTHES MAN WAITING AT THE STATION ALL THE WEEK
WHEREVER THE HIGH GABLE FOLK GO HE WILL KEEP THEM IN SIGHT BUT HE
MUST HAVE BEEN HARD PUT TO IT WHEN MISS BURNET BROKE AWAY HOWEVER
YOUR MAN PICKED HER UP AND IT ALL ENDS WELL WE CANT ARREST WITHOUT
HER EVIDENCE THAT IS CLEAR SO THE SOONER WE GET A STATEMENT THE
BETTER
EVERY MINUTE SHE GETS STRONGER SAID HOLMES GLANCING AT THE
GOVERNESS BUT TELL ME BAYNES WHO IS THIS MAN HENDERSON
HENDERSON THE INSPECTOR ANSWERED IS DON MURILLO ONCE CALLED THE
TIGER OF SAN PEDRO
THE TIGER OF SAN PEDRO THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE MAN CAME BACK TO ME
IN A FLASH HE HAD MADE HIS NAME AS THE MOST LEWD AND BLOODTHIRSTY
TYRANT THAT HAD EVER GOVERNED ANY COUNTRY WITH A PRETENCE TO
CIVILIZATION STRONG FEARLESS AND ENERGETIC HE HAD SUFFICIENT
VIRTUE TO ENABLE HIM TO IMPOSE HIS ODIOUS VICES UPON A COWERING
PEOPLE FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS HIS NAME WAS A TERROR THROUGH ALL
CENTRAL AMERICA AT THE END OF THAT TIME THERE WAS A UNIVERSAL RISING
AGAINST HIM BUT HE WAS AS CUNNING AS HE WAS CRUEL AND AT THE FIRST
WHISPER OF COMING TROUBLE HE HAD SECRETLY CONVEYED HIS TREASURES
ABOARD A SHIP WHICH WAS MANNED BY DEVOTED ADHERENTS IT WAS AN EMPTY
PALACE WHICH WAS STORMED BY THE INSURGENTS NEXT DAY THE DICTATOR
HIS TWO CHILDREN HIS SECRETARY AND HIS WEALTH HAD ALL ESCAPED THEM
FROM THAT MOMENT HE HAD VANISHED FROM THE WORLD AND HIS IDENTITY HAD
BEEN A FREQUENT SUBJECT FOR COMMENT IN THE EUROPEAN PRESS
YES SIR DON MURILLO THE TIGER OF SAN PEDRO SAID BAYNES IF YOU
LOOK IT UP YOU WILL FIND THAT THE SAN PEDRO COLOURS ARE GREEN AND
WHITE SAME AS IN THE NOTE MR HOLMES HENDERSON HE CALLED HIMSELF
BUT I TRACED HIM BACK PARIS AND ROME AND MADRID TO BARCELONA WHERE
HIS SHIP CAME IN IN THEYVE BEEN LOOKING FOR HIM ALL THE TIME
FOR THEIR REVENGE BUT IT IS ONLY NOW THAT THEY HAVE BEGUN TO FIND
HIM OUT
THEY DISCOVERED HIM A YEAR AGO SAID MISS BURNET WHO HAD SAT UP
AND WAS NOW INTENTLY FOLLOWING THE CONVERSATION ONCE ALREADY HIS
LIFE HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED BUT SOME EVIL SPIRIT SHIELDED HIM NOW
AGAIN IT IS THE NOBLE CHIVALROUS GARCIA WHO HAS FALLEN WHILE THE
MONSTER GOES SAFE BUT ANOTHER WILL COME AND YET ANOTHER UNTIL SOME
DAY JUSTICE WILL BE DONE THAT IS AS CERTAIN AS THE RISE OF
TOMORROWS SUN HER THIN HANDS CLENCHED AND HER WORN FACE BLANCHED
WITH THE PASSION OF HER HATRED
BUT HOW COME YOU INTO THIS MATTER MISS BURNET ASKED HOLMES HOW
CAN AN ENGLISH LADY JOIN IN SUCH A MURDEROUS AFFAIR
I JOIN IN IT BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY IN THE WORLD BY WHICH
JUSTICE CAN BE GAINED WHAT DOES THE LAW OF ENGLAND CARE FOR THE
RIVERS OF BLOOD SHED YEARS AGO IN SAN PEDRO OR FOR THE SHIPLOAD OF
TREASURE WHICH THIS MAN HAS STOLEN TO YOU THEY ARE LIKE CRIMES
COMMITTED IN SOME OTHER PLANET BUT WE KNOW WE HAVE LEARNED THE
TRUTH IN SORROW AND IN SUFFERING TO US THERE IS NO FIEND IN HELL
LIKE JUAN MURILLO AND NO PEACE IN LIFE WHILE HIS VICTIMS STILL CRY
FOR VENGEANCE
NO DOUBT SAID HOLMES HE WAS AS YOU SAY I HAVE HEARD THAT HE WAS
ATROCIOUS BUT HOW ARE YOU AFFECTED
I WILL TELL YOU IT ALL THIS VILLAINS POLICY WAS TO MURDER ON ONE
PRETEXT OR ANOTHER EVERY MAN WHO SHOWED SUCH PROMISE THAT HE MIGHT
IN TIME COME TO BE A DANGEROUS RIVAL MY HUSBANDYES MY REAL NAME
IS SIGNORA VICTOR DURANDOWAS THE SAN PEDRO MINISTER IN LONDON HE
MET ME AND MARRIED ME THERE A NOBLER MAN NEVER LIVED UPON EARTH
UNHAPPILY MURILLO HEARD OF HIS EXCELLENCE RECALLED HIM ON SOME
PRETEXT AND HAD HIM SHOT WITH A PREMONITION OF HIS FATE HE HAD
REFUSED TO TAKE ME WITH HIM HIS ESTATES WERE CONFISCATED AND I WAS
LEFT WITH A PITTANCE AND A BROKEN HEART
THEN CAME THE DOWNFALL OF THE TYRANT HE ESCAPED AS YOU HAVE JUST
DESCRIBED BUT THE MANY WHOSE LIVES HE HAD RUINED WHOSE NEAREST AND
DEAREST HAD SUFFERED TORTURE AND DEATH AT HIS HANDS WOULD NOT LET
THE MATTER REST THEY BANDED THEMSELVES INTO A SOCIETY WHICH SHOULD
NEVER BE DISSOLVED UNTIL THE WORK WAS DONE IT WAS MY PART AFTER WE
HAD DISCOVERED IN THE TRANSFORMED HENDERSON THE FALLEN DESPOT TO
ATTACH MYSELF TO HIS HOUSEHOLD AND KEEP THE OTHERS IN TOUCH WITH HIS
MOVEMENTS THIS I WAS ABLE TO DO BY SECURING THE POSITION OF
GOVERNESS IN HIS FAMILY HE LITTLE KNEW THAT THE WOMAN WHO FACED HIM
AT EVERY MEAL WAS THE WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND HE HAD HURRIED AT AN HOURS
NOTICE INTO ETERNITY I SMILED ON HIM DID MY DUTY TO HIS CHILDREN
AND BIDED MY TIME AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE IN PARIS AND FAILED WE
ZIGZAGGED SWIFTLY HERE AND THERE OVER EUROPE TO THROW OFF THE
PURSUERS AND FINALLY RETURNED TO THIS HOUSE WHICH HE HAD TAKEN UPON
HIS FIRST ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
BUT HERE ALSO THE MINISTERS OF JUSTICE WERE WAITING KNOWING THAT HE
WOULD RETURN THERE GARCIA WHO IS THE SON OF THE FORMER HIGHEST
DIGNITARY IN SAN PEDRO WAS WAITING WITH TWO TRUSTY COMPANIONS OF
HUMBLE STATION ALL THREE FIRED WITH THE SAME REASONS FOR REVENGE HE
COULD DO LITTLE DURING THE DAY FOR MURILLO TOOK EVERY PRECAUTION AND
NEVER WENT OUT SAVE WITH HIS SATELLITE LUCAS OR LOPEZ AS HE WAS
KNOWN IN THE DAYS OF HIS GREATNESS AT NIGHT HOWEVER HE SLEPT
ALONE AND THE AVENGER MIGHT FIND HIM ON A CERTAIN EVENING WHICH
HAD BEEN PREARRANGED I SENT MY FRIEND FINAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE
MAN WAS FOREVER ON THE ALERT AND CONTINUALLY CHANGED HIS ROOM I WAS
TO SEE THAT THE DOORS WERE OPEN AND THE SIGNAL OF A GREEN OR WHITE
LIGHT IN A WINDOW WHICH FACED THE DRIVE WAS TO GIVE NOTICE IF ALL WAS
SAFE OR IF THE ATTEMPT HAD BETTER BE POSTPONED
BUT EVERYTHING WENT WRONG WITH US IN SOME WAY I HAD EXCITED THE
SUSPICION OF LOPEZ THE SECRETARY HE CREPT UP BEHIND ME AND SPRANG
UPON ME JUST AS I HAD FINISHED THE NOTE HE AND HIS MASTER DRAGGED ME
TO MY ROOM AND HELD JUDGMENT UPON ME AS A CONVICTED TRAITRESS THEN
AND THERE THEY WOULD HAVE PLUNGED THEIR KNIVES INTO ME COULD THEY
HAVE SEEN HOW TO ESCAPE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DEED FINALLY AFTER
MUCH DEBATE THEY CONCLUDED THAT MY MURDER WAS TOO DANGEROUS BUT
THEY DETERMINED TO GET RID FOREVER OF GARCIA THEY HAD GAGGED ME AND
MURILLO TWISTED MY ARM ROUND UNTIL I GAVE HIM THE ADDRESS I SWEAR
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE TWISTED IT OFF HAD I UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WOULD MEAN
TO GARCIA LOPEZ ADDRESSED THE NOTE WHICH I HAD WRITTEN SEALED IT
WITH HIS SLEEVELINK AND SENT IT BY THE HAND OF THE SERVANT JOSE
HOW THEY MURDERED HIM I DO NOT KNOW SAVE THAT IT WAS MURILLOS HAND
WHO STRUCK HIM DOWN FOR LOPEZ HAD REMAINED TO GUARD ME I BELIEVE HE
MUST HAVE WAITED AMONG THE GORSE BUSHES THROUGH WHICH THE PATH WINDS
AND STRUCK HIM DOWN AS HE PASSED AT FIRST THEY WERE OF A MIND TO LET
HIM ENTER THE HOUSE AND TO KILL HIM AS A DETECTED BURGLAR BUT THEY
ARGUED THAT IF THEY WERE MIXED UP IN AN INQUIRY THEIR OWN IDENTITY
WOULD AT ONCE BE PUBLICLY DISCLOSED AND THEY WOULD BE OPEN TO FURTHER
ATTACKS WITH THE DEATH OF GARCIA THE PURSUIT MIGHT CEASE SINCE
SUCH A DEATH MIGHT FRIGHTEN OTHERS FROM THE TASK
ALL WOULD NOW HAVE BEEN WELL FOR THEM HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR MY
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THEY HAD DONE I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THERE WERE
TIMES WHEN MY LIFE HUNG IN THE BALANCE I WAS CONFINED TO MY ROOM
TERRORIZED BY THE MOST HORRIBLE THREATS CRUELLY ILLUSED TO BREAK MY
SPIRITSEE THIS STAB ON MY SHOULDER AND THE BRUISES FROM END TO END
OF MY ARMSAND A GAG WAS THRUST INTO MY MOUTH ON THE ONE OCCASION
WHEN I TRIED TO CALL FROM THE WINDOW FOR FIVE DAYS THIS CRUEL
IMPRISONMENT CONTINUED WITH HARDLY ENOUGH FOOD TO HOLD BODY AND SOUL
TOGETHER THIS AFTERNOON A GOOD LUNCH WAS BROUGHT ME BUT THE MOMENT
AFTER I TOOK IT I KNEW THAT I HAD BEEN DRUGGED IN A SORT OF DREAM I
REMEMBER BEING HALFLED HALFCARRIED TO THE CARRIAGE IN THE SAME
STATE I WAS CONVEYED TO THE TRAIN ONLY THEN WHEN THE WHEELS WERE
ALMOST MOVING DID I SUDDENLY REALIZE THAT MY LIBERTY LAY IN MY OWN
HANDS I SPRANG OUT THEY TRIED TO DRAG ME BACK AND HAD IT NOT BEEN
FOR THE HELP OF THIS GOOD MAN WHO LED ME TO THE CAB I SHOULD NEVER
HAD BROKEN AWAY NOW THANK GOD I AM BEYOND THEIR POWER FOREVER
WE HAD ALL LISTENED INTENTLY TO THIS REMARKABLE STATEMENT IT WAS
HOLMES WHO BROKE THE SILENCE
OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE NOT OVER HE REMARKED SHAKING HIS HEAD OUR
POLICE WORK ENDS BUT OUR LEGAL WORK BEGINS
EXACTLY SAID I A PLAUSIBLE LAWYER COULD MAKE IT OUT AS AN ACT OF
SELFDEFENCE THERE MAY BE A HUNDRED CRIMES IN THE BACKGROUND BUT IT
IS ONLY ON THIS ONE THAT THEY CAN BE TRIED
COME COME SAID BAYNES CHEERILY I THINK BETTER OF THE LAW THAN
THAT SELFDEFENCE IS ONE THING TO ENTICE A MAN IN COLD BLOOD WITH
THE OBJECT OF MURDERING HIM IS ANOTHER WHATEVER DANGER YOU MAY FEAR
FROM HIM NO NO WE SHALL ALL BE JUSTIFIED WHEN WE SEE THE TENANTS
OF HIGH GABLE AT THE NEXT GUILDFORD ASSIZES
IT IS A MATTER OF HISTORY HOWEVER THAT A LITTLE TIME WAS STILL TO
ELAPSE BEFORE THE TIGER OF SAN PEDRO SHOULD MEET WITH HIS DESERTS
WILY AND BOLD HE AND HIS COMPANION THREW THEIR PURSUER OFF THEIR
TRACK BY ENTERING A LODGINGHOUSE IN EDMONTON STREET AND LEAVING BY
THE BACKGATE INTO CURZON SQUARE FROM THAT DAY THEY WERE SEEN NO
MORE IN ENGLAND SOME SIX MONTHS AFTERWARDS THE MARQUESS OF MONTALVA
AND SIGNOR RULLI HIS SECRETARY WERE BOTH MURDERED IN THEIR ROOMS AT
THE HOTEL ESCURIAL AT MADRID THE CRIME WAS ASCRIBED TO NIHILISM AND
THE MURDERERS WERE NEVER ARRESTED INSPECTOR BAYNES VISITED US AT
BAKER STREET WITH A PRINTED DESCRIPTION OF THE DARK FACE OF THE
SECRETARY AND OF THE MASTERFUL FEATURES THE MAGNETIC BLACK EYES
AND THE TUFTED BROWS OF HIS MASTER WE COULD NOT DOUBT THAT JUSTICE
IF BELATED HAD COME AT LAST
A CHAOTIC CASE MY DEAR WATSON SAID HOLMES OVER AN EVENING PIPE
IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO PRESENT IN THAT COMPACT FORM
WHICH IS DEAR TO YOUR HEART IT COVERS TWO CONTINENTS CONCERNS TWO
GROUPS OF MYSTERIOUS PERSONS AND IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE
HIGHLY RESPECTABLE PRESENCE OF OUR FRIEND SCOTT ECCLES WHOSE
INCLUSION SHOWS ME THAT THE DECEASED GARCIA HAD A SCHEMING MIND AND A
WELLDEVELOPED INSTINCT OF SELFPRESERVATION IT IS REMARKABLE ONLY
FOR THE FACT THAT AMID A PERFECT JUNGLE OF POSSIBILITIES WE WITH OUR
WORTHY COLLABORATOR THE INSPECTOR HAVE KEPT OUR CLOSE HOLD ON THE
ESSENTIALS AND SO BEEN GUIDED ALONG THE CROOKED AND WINDING PATH IS
THERE ANY POINT WHICH IS NOT QUITE CLEAR TO YOU
THE OBJECT OF THE MULATTO COOKS RETURN
I THINK THAT THE STRANGE CREATURE IN THE KITCHEN MAY ACCOUNT FOR IT
THE MAN WAS A PRIMITIVE SAVAGE FROM THE BACKWOODS OF SAN PEDRO AND
THIS WAS HIS FETISH WHEN HIS COMPANION AND HE HAD FLED TO SOME
PREARRANGED RETREATALREADY OCCUPIED NO DOUBT BY A CONFEDERATETHE
COMPANION HAD PERSUADED HIM TO LEAVE SO COMPROMISING AN ARTICLE OF
FURNITURE BUT THE MULATTOS HEART WAS WITH IT AND HE WAS DRIVEN
BACK TO IT NEXT DAY WHEN ON RECONNOITERING THROUGH THE WINDOW HE
FOUND POLICEMAN WALTERS IN POSSESSION HE WAITED THREE DAYS LONGER
AND THEN HIS PIETY OR HIS SUPERSTITION DROVE HIM TO TRY ONCE MORE
INSPECTOR BAYNES WHO WITH HIS USUAL ASTUTENESS HAD MINIMIZED THE
INCIDENT BEFORE ME HAD REALLY RECOGNIZED ITS IMPORTANCE AND HAD LEFT
A TRAP INTO WHICH THE CREATURE WALKED ANY OTHER POINT WATSON
THE TORN BIRD THE PAIL OF BLOOD THE CHARRED BONES ALL THE MYSTERY
OF THAT WEIRD KITCHEN
HOLMES SMILED AS HE TURNED UP AN ENTRY IN HIS NOTEBOOK
I SPENT A MORNING IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM READING UP ON THAT AND OTHER
POINTS HERE IS A QUOTATION FROM ECKERMANNS VOODOOISM AND THE
NEGROID RELIGIONS
THE TRUE VOODOOWORSHIPPER ATTEMPTS NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE WITHOUT
CERTAIN SACRIFICES WHICH ARE INTENDED TO PROPITIATE HIS UNCLEAN GODS
IN EXTREME CASES THESE RITES TAKE THE FORM OF HUMAN SACRIFICES
FOLLOWED BY CANNIBALISM THE MORE USUAL VICTIMS ARE A WHITE COCK
WHICH IS PLUCKED IN PIECES ALIVE OR A BLACK GOAT WHOSE THROAT IS
CUT AND BODY BURNED
SO YOU SEE OUR SAVAGE FRIEND WAS VERY ORTHODOX IN HIS RITUAL IT IS
GROTESQUE WATSON HOLMES ADDED AS HE SLOWLY FASTENED HIS NOTEBOOK
BUT AS I HAVE HAD OCCASION TO REMARK THERE IS BUT ONE STEP FROM
THE GROTESQUE TO THE HORRIBLE
THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX
IN CHOOSING A FEW TYPICAL CASES WHICH ILLUSTRATE THE REMARKABLE
MENTAL QUALITIES OF MY FRIEND SHERLOCK HOLMES I HAVE ENDEAVOURED
AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO SELECT THOSE WHICH PRESENTED THE MINIMUM OF
SENSATIONALISM WHILE OFFERING A FAIR FIELD FOR HIS TALENTS IT IS
HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY IMPOSSIBLE ENTIRELY TO SEPARATE THE
SENSATIONAL FROM THE CRIMINAL AND A CHRONICLER IS LEFT IN THE
DILEMMA THAT HE MUST EITHER SACRIFICE DETAILS WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO
HIS STATEMENT AND SO GIVE A FALSE IMPRESSION OF THE PROBLEM OR HE
MUST USE MATTER WHICH CHANCE AND NOT CHOICE HAS PROVIDED HIM WITH
WITH THIS SHORT PREFACE I SHALL TURN TO MY NOTES OF WHAT PROVED TO BE
A STRANGE THOUGH A PECULIARLY TERRIBLE CHAIN OF EVENTS
IT WAS A BLAZING HOT DAY IN AUGUST BAKER STREET WAS LIKE AN OVEN
AND THE GLARE OF THE SUNLIGHT UPON THE YELLOW BRICKWORK OF THE HOUSE
ACROSS THE ROAD WAS PAINFUL TO THE EYE IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
THESE WERE THE SAME WALLS WHICH LOOMED SO GLOOMILY THROUGH THE FOGS
OF WINTER OUR BLINDS WERE HALFDRAWN AND HOLMES LAY CURLED UPON THE
SOFA READING AND REREADING A LETTER WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED BY THE
MORNING POST FOR MYSELF MY TERM OF SERVICE IN INDIA HAD TRAINED ME
TO STAND HEAT BETTER THAN COLD AND A THERMOMETER AT NINETY WAS NO
HARDSHIP BUT THE MORNING PAPER WAS UNINTERESTING PARLIAMENT HAD
RISEN EVERYBODY WAS OUT OF TOWN AND I YEARNED FOR THE GLADES OF THE
NEW FOREST OR THE SHINGLE OF SOUTHSEA A DEPLETED BANK ACCOUNT HAD
CAUSED ME TO POSTPONE MY HOLIDAY AND AS TO MY COMPANION NEITHER THE
COUNTRY NOR THE SEA PRESENTED THE SLIGHTEST ATTRACTION TO HIM HE
LOVED TO LIE IN THE VERY CENTER OF FIVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WITH HIS
FILAMENTS STRETCHING OUT AND RUNNING THROUGH THEM RESPONSIVE TO
EVERY LITTLE RUMOUR OR SUSPICION OF UNSOLVED CRIME APPRECIATION OF
NATURE FOUND NO PLACE AMONG HIS MANY GIFTS AND HIS ONLY CHANGE WAS
WHEN HE TURNED HIS MIND FROM THE EVILDOER OF THE TOWN TO TRACK DOWN
HIS BROTHER OF THE COUNTRY
FINDING THAT HOLMES WAS TOO ABSORBED FOR CONVERSATION I HAD TOSSED
SIDE THE BARREN PAPER AND LEANING BACK IN MY CHAIR I FELL INTO A
BROWN STUDY SUDDENLY MY COMPANIONS VOICE BROKE IN UPON MY THOUGHTS
YOU ARE RIGHT WATSON SAID HE IT DOES SEEM A MOST PREPOSTEROUS
WAY OF SETTLING A DISPUTE
MOST PREPOSTEROUS I EXCLAIMED AND THEN SUDDENLY REALIZING HOW HE
HAD ECHOED THE INMOST THOUGHT OF MY SOUL I SAT UP IN MY CHAIR AND
STARED AT HIM IN BLANK AMAZEMENT
WHAT IS THIS HOLMES I CRIED THIS IS BEYOND ANYTHING WHICH I
COULD HAVE IMAGINED
HE LAUGHED HEARTILY AT MY PERPLEXITY
YOU REMEMBER SAID HE THAT SOME LITTLE TIME AGO WHEN I READ YOU
THE PASSAGE IN ONE OF POES SKETCHES IN WHICH A CLOSE REASONER
FOLLOWS THE UNSPOKEN THOUGHTS OF HIS COMPANION YOU WERE INCLINED TO
TREAT THE MATTER AS A MERE TOURDEFORCE OF THE AUTHOR ON MY
REMARKING THAT I WAS CONSTANTLY IN THE HABIT OF DOING THE SAME THING
YOU EXPRESSED INCREDULITY
OH NO
PERHAPS NOT WITH YOUR TONGUE MY DEAR WATSON BUT CERTAINLY WITH
YOUR EYEBROWS SO WHEN I SAW YOU THROW DOWN YOUR PAPER AND ENTER UPON
A TRAIN OF THOUGHT I WAS VERY HAPPY TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF
READING IT OFF AND EVENTUALLY OF BREAKING INTO IT AS A PROOF THAT I
HAD BEEN IN RAPPORT WITH YOU
BUT I WAS STILL FAR FROM SATISFIED IN THE EXAMPLE WHICH YOU READ TO
ME SAID I THE REASONER DREW HIS CONCLUSIONS FROM THE ACTIONS OF
THE MAN WHOM HE OBSERVED IF I REMEMBER RIGHT HE STUMBLED OVER A
HEAP OF STONES LOOKED UP AT THE STARS AND SO ON BUT I HAVE BEEN
SEATED QUIETLY IN MY CHAIR AND WHAT CLUES CAN I HAVE GIVEN YOU
YOU DO YOURSELF AN INJUSTICE THE FEATURES ARE GIVEN TO MAN AS THE
MEANS BY WHICH HE SHALL EXPRESS HIS EMOTIONS AND YOURS ARE FAITHFUL
SERVANTS
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU READ MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS FROM MY
FEATURES
YOUR FEATURES AND ESPECIALLY YOUR EYES PERHAPS YOU CANNOT YOURSELF
RECALL HOW YOUR REVERIE COMMENCED
NO I CANNOT
THEN I WILL TELL YOU AFTER THROWING DOWN YOUR PAPER WHICH WAS THE
ACTION WHICH DREW MY ATTENTION TO YOU YOU SAT FOR HALF A MINUTE WITH
A VACANT EXPRESSION THEN YOUR EYES FIXED THEMSELVES UPON YOUR NEWLY
FRAMED PICTURE OF GENERAL GORDON AND I SAW BY THE ALTERATION IN YOUR
FACE THAT A TRAIN OF THOUGHT HAD BEEN STARTED BUT IT DID NOT LEAD
VERY FAR YOUR EYES FLASHED ACROSS TO THE UNFRAMED PORTRAIT OF HENRY
WARD BEECHER WHICH STANDS UPON THE TOP OF YOUR BOOKS THEN YOU
GLANCED UP AT THE WALL AND OF COURSE YOUR MEANING WAS OBVIOUS YOU
WERE THINKING THAT IF THE PORTRAIT WERE FRAMED IT WOULD JUST COVER
THAT BARE SPACE AND CORRESPOND WITH GORDONS PICTURE THERE
YOU HAVE FOLLOWED ME WONDERFULLY I EXCLAIMED
SO FAR I COULD HARDLY HAVE GONE ASTRAY BUT NOW YOUR THOUGHTS WENT
BACK TO BEECHER AND YOU LOOKED HARD ACROSS AS IF YOU WERE STUDYING
THE CHARACTER IN HIS FEATURES THEN YOUR EYES CEASED TO PUCKER BUT
YOU CONTINUED TO LOOK ACROSS AND YOUR FACE WAS THOUGHTFUL YOU WERE
RECALLING THE INCIDENTS OF BEECHERS CAREER I WAS WELL AWARE THAT
YOU COULD NOT DO THIS WITHOUT THINKING OF THE MISSION WHICH HE
UNDERTOOK ON BEHALF OF THE NORTH AT THE TIME OF THE CIVIL WAR FOR I
REMEMBER YOUR EXPRESSING YOUR PASSIONATE INDIGNATION AT THE WAY IN
WHICH HE WAS RECEIVED BY THE MORE TURBULENT OF OUR PEOPLE YOU FELT
SO STRONGLY ABOUT IT THAT I KNEW YOU COULD NOT THINK OF BEECHER
WITHOUT THINKING OF THAT ALSO WHEN A MOMENT LATER I SAW YOUR EYES
WANDER AWAY FROM THE PICTURE I SUSPECTED THAT YOUR MIND HAD NOW
TURNED TO THE CIVIL WAR AND WHEN I OBSERVED THAT YOUR LIPS SET YOUR
EYES SPARKLED AND YOUR HANDS CLENCHED I WAS POSITIVE THAT YOU WERE
INDEED THINKING OF THE GALLANTRY WHICH WAS SHOWN BY BOTH SIDES IN
THAT DESPERATE STRUGGLE BUT THEN AGAIN YOUR FACE GREW SADDER YOU
SHOOK YOUR HEAD YOU WERE DWELLING UPON THE SADNESS AND HORROR AND
USELESS WASTE OF LIFE YOUR HAND STOLE TOWARDS YOUR OWN OLD WOUND AND
A SMILE QUIVERED ON YOUR LIPS WHICH SHOWED ME THAT THE RIDICULOUS
SIDE OF THIS METHOD OF SETTLING INTERNATIONAL QUESTIONS HAD FORCED
ITSELF UPON YOUR MIND AT THIS POINT I AGREED WITH YOU THAT IT WAS
PREPOSTEROUS AND WAS GLAD TO FIND THAT ALL MY DEDUCTIONS HAD BEEN
CORRECT
ABSOLUTELY SAID I AND NOW THAT YOU HAVE EXPLAINED IT I CONFESS
THAT I AM AS AMAZED AS BEFORE
IT WAS VERY SUPERFICIAL MY DEAR WATSON I ASSURE YOU I SHOULD NOT
HAVE INTRUDED IT UPON YOUR ATTENTION HAD YOU NOT SHOWN SOME
INCREDULITY THE OTHER DAY BUT I HAVE IN MY HANDS HERE A LITTLE
PROBLEM WHICH MAY PROVE TO BE MORE DIFFICULT OF SOLUTION THAN MY
SMALL ESSAY IN THOUGHT READING HAVE YOU OBSERVED IN THE PAPER A
SHORT PARAGRAPH REFERRING TO THE REMARKABLE CONTENTS OF A PACKET SENT
THROUGH THE POST TO MISS CUSHING OF CROSS STREET CROYDON
NO I SAW NOTHING
AH THEN YOU MUST HAVE OVERLOOKED IT JUST TOSS IT OVER TO ME HERE
IT IS UNDER THE FINANCIAL COLUMN PERHAPS YOU WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH
TO READ IT ALOUD
I PICKED UP THE PAPER WHICH HE HAD THROWN BACK TO ME AND READ THE
PARAGRAPH INDICATED IT WAS HEADED A GRUESOME PACKET
MISS SUSAN CUSHING LIVING AT CROSS STREET CROYDON HAS BEEN MADE
THE VICTIM OF WHAT MUST BE REGARDED AS A PECULIARLY REVOLTING
PRACTICAL JOKE UNLESS SOME MORE SINISTER MEANING SHOULD PROVE TO BE
ATTACHED TO THE INCIDENT AT TWO OCLOCK YESTERDAY AFTERNOON A SMALL
PACKET WRAPPED IN BROWN PAPER WAS HANDED IN BY THE POSTMAN A
CARDBOARD BOX WAS INSIDE WHICH WAS FILLED WITH COARSE SALT ON
EMPTYING THIS MISS CUSHING WAS HORRIFIED TO FIND TWO HUMAN EARS
APPARENTLY QUITE FRESHLY SEVERED THE BOX HAD BEEN SENT BY PARCEL
POST FROM BELFAST UPON THE MORNING BEFORE THERE IS NO INDICATION AS
TO THE SENDER AND THE MATTER IS THE MORE MYSTERIOUS AS MISS CUSHING
WHO IS A MAIDEN LADY OF FIFTY HAS LED A MOST RETIRED LIFE AND HAS
SO FEW ACQUAINTANCES OR CORRESPONDENTS THAT IT IS A RARE EVENT FOR
HER TO RECEIVE ANYTHING THROUGH THE POST SOME YEARS AGO HOWEVER
WHEN SHE RESIDED AT PENGE SHE LET APARTMENTS IN HER HOUSE TO THREE
YOUNG MEDICAL STUDENTS WHOM SHE WAS OBLIGED TO GET RID OF ON ACCOUNT
OF THEIR NOISY AND IRREGULAR HABITS THE POLICE ARE OF OPINION THAT
THIS OUTRAGE MAY HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED UPON MISS CUSHING BY THESE
YOUTHS WHO OWED HER A GRUDGE AND WHO HOPED TO FRIGHTEN HER BY
SENDING HER THESE RELICS OF THE DISSECTINGROOMS SOME PROBABILITY IS
LENT TO THE THEORY BY THE FACT THAT ONE OF THESE STUDENTS CAME FROM
THE NORTH OF IRELAND AND TO THE BEST OF MISS CUSHINGS BELIEF FROM
BELFAST IN THE MEANTIME THE MATTER IS BEING ACTIVELY INVESTIGATED
MR LESTRADE ONE OF THE VERY SMARTEST OF OUR DETECTIVE OFFICERS
BEING IN CHARGE OF THE CASE
SO MUCH FOR THE DAILY CHRONICLE SAID HOLMES AS I FINISHED READING
NOW FOR OUR FRIEND LESTRADE I HAD A NOTE FROM HIM THIS MORNING IN
WHICH HE SAYS
I THINK THAT THIS CASE IS VERY MUCH IN YOUR LINE WE HAVE EVERY HOPE
OF CLEARING THE MATTER UP BUT WE FIND A LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN GETTING
ANYTHING TO WORK UPON WE HAVE OF COURSE WIRED TO THE BELFAST
POSTOFFICE BUT A LARGE NUMBER OF PARCELS WERE HANDED IN UPON THAT
DAY AND THEY HAVE NO MEANS OF IDENTIFYING THIS PARTICULAR ONE OR OF
REMEMBERING THE SENDER THE BOX IS A HALFPOUND BOX OF HONEYDEW
TOBACCO AND DOES NOT HELP US IN ANY WAY THE MEDICAL STUDENT THEORY
STILL APPEARS TO ME TO BE THE MOST FEASIBLE BUT IF YOU SHOULD HAVE A
FEW HOURS TO SPARE I SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU OUT HERE I
SHALL BE EITHER AT THE HOUSE OR IN THE POLICESTATION ALL DAY
WHAT SAY YOU WATSON CAN YOU RISE SUPERIOR TO THE HEAT AND RUN DOWN
TO CROYDON WITH ME ON THE OFF CHANCE OF A CASE FOR YOUR ANNALS
I WAS LONGING FOR SOMETHING TO DO
YOU SHALL HAVE IT THEN RING FOR OUR BOOTS AND TELL THEM TO ORDER A
CAB ILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT WHEN I HAVE CHANGED MY DRESSINGGOWN
AND FILLED MY CIGARCASE
A SHOWER OF RAIN FELL WHILE WE WERE IN THE TRAIN AND THE HEAT WAS
FAR LESS OPPRESSIVE IN CROYDON THAN IN TOWN HOLMES HAD SENT ON A
WIRE SO THAT LESTRADE AS WIRY AS DAPPER AND AS FERRETLIKE AS
EVER WAS WAITING FOR US AT THE STATION A WALK OF FIVE MINUTES TOOK
US TO CROSS STREET WHERE MISS CUSHING RESIDED
IT WAS A VERY LONG STREET OF TWOSTORY BRICK HOUSES NEAT AND PRIM
WITH WHITENED STONE STEPS AND LITTLE GROUPS OF APRONED WOMEN
GOSSIPING AT THE DOORS HALFWAY DOWN LESTRADE STOPPED AND TAPPED AT
A DOOR WHICH WAS OPENED BY A SMALL SERVANT GIRL MISS CUSHING WAS
SITTING IN THE FRONT ROOM INTO WHICH WE WERE USHERED SHE WAS A
PLACIDFACED WOMAN WITH LARGE GENTLE EYES AND GRIZZLED HAIR
CURVING DOWN OVER HER TEMPLES ON EACH SIDE A WORKED ANTIMACASSAR LAY
UPON HER LAP AND A BASKET OF COLOURED SILKS STOOD UPON A STOOL BESIDE
HER
THEY ARE IN THE OUTHOUSE THOSE DREADFUL THINGS SAID SHE AS
LESTRADE ENTERED I WISH THAT YOU WOULD TAKE THEM AWAY ALTOGETHER
SO I SHALL MISS CUSHING I ONLY KEPT THEM HERE UNTIL MY FRIEND MR
HOLMES SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM IN YOUR PRESENCE
WHY IN MY PRESENCE SIR
IN CASE HE WISHED TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS
WHAT IS THE USE OF ASKING ME QUESTIONS WHEN I TELL YOU I KNOW
NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT IT
QUITE SO MADAM SAID HOLMES IN HIS SOOTHING WAY I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ANNOYED MORE THAN ENOUGH ALREADY OVER THIS
BUSINESS
INDEED I HAVE SIR I AM A QUIET WOMAN AND LIVE A RETIRED LIFE IT
IS SOMETHING NEW FOR ME TO SEE MY NAME IN THE PAPERS AND TO FIND THE
POLICE IN MY HOUSE I WONT HAVE THOSE THINGS IN HERE MR LESTRADE
IF YOU WISH TO SEE THEM YOU MUST GO TO THE OUTHOUSE
IT WAS A SMALL SHED IN THE NARROW GARDEN WHICH RAN BEHIND THE HOUSE
LESTRADE WENT IN AND BROUGHT OUT A YELLOW CARDBOARD BOX WITH A PIECE
OF BROWN PAPER AND SOME STRING THERE WAS A BENCH AT THE END OF THE
PATH AND WE ALL SAT DOWN WHILE HOMES EXAMINED ONE BY ONE THE
ARTICLES WHICH LESTRADE HAD HANDED TO HIM
THE STRING IS EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING HE REMARKED HOLDING IT UP
TO THE LIGHT AND SNIFFING AT IT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS STRING
LESTRADE
IT HAS BEEN TARRED
PRECISELY IT IS A PIECE OF TARRED TWINE YOU HAVE ALSO NO DOUBT
REMARKED THAT MISS CUSHING HAS CUT THE CORD WITH A SCISSORS AS CAN
BE SEEN BY THE DOUBLE FRAY ON EACH SIDE THIS IS OF IMPORTANCE
I CANNOT SEE THE IMPORTANCE SAID LESTRADE
THE IMPORTANCE LIES IN THE FACT THAT THE KNOT IS LEFT INTACT AND
THAT THIS KNOT IS OF A PECULIAR CHARACTER
IT IS VERY NEATLY TIED I HAD ALREADY MADE A NOTE OF THAT EFFECT
SAID LESTRADE COMPLACENTLY
SO MUCH FOR THE STRING THEN SAID HOLMES SMILING NOW FOR THE
BOX WRAPPER BROWN PAPER WITH A DISTINCT SMELL OF COFFEE WHAT DID
YOU NOT OBSERVE IT I THINK THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF IT ADDRESS
PRINTED IN RATHER STRAGGLING CHARACTERS MISS S CUSHING CROSS
STREET CROYDON DONE WITH A BROADPOINTED PEN PROBABLY A J AND
WITH VERY INFERIOR INK THE WORD CROYDON HAS BEEN ORIGINALLY
SPELLED WITH AN I WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED TO Y THE PARCEL WAS
DIRECTED THEN BY A MANTHE PRINTING IS DISTINCTLY MASCULINEOF
LIMITED EDUCATION AND UNACQUAINTED WITH THE TOWN OF CROYDON SO FAR
SO GOOD THE BOX IS A YELLOW HALFPOUND HONEYDEW BOX WITH NOTHING
DISTINCTIVE SAVE TWO THUMB MARKS AT THE LEFT BOTTOM CORNER IT IS
FILLED WITH ROUGH SALT OF THE QUALITY USED FOR PRESERVING HIDES AND
OTHER OF THE COARSER COMMERCIAL PURPOSES AND EMBEDDED IN IT ARE
THESE VERY SINGULAR ENCLOSURES
HE TOOK OUT THE TWO EARS AS HE SPOKE AND LAYING A BOARD ACROSS HIS
KNEE HE EXAMINED THEM MINUTELY WHILE LESTRADE AND I BENDING FORWARD
ON EACH SIDE OF HIM GLANCED ALTERNATELY AT THESE DREADFUL RELICS AND
AT THE THOUGHTFUL EAGER FACE OF OUR COMPANION FINALLY HE RETURNED
THEM TO THE BOX ONCE MORE AND SAT FOR A WHILE IN DEEP MEDITATION
YOU HAVE OBSERVED OF COURSE SAID HE AT LAST THAT THE EARS ARE
NOT A PAIR
YES I HAVE NOTICED THAT BUT IF THIS WERE THE PRACTICAL JOKE OF
SOME STUDENTS FROM THE DISSECTINGROOMS IT WOULD BE AS EASY FOR THEM
TO SEND TWO ODD EARS AS A PAIR
PRECISELY BUT THIS IS NOT A PRACTICAL JOKE
YOU ARE SURE OF IT
THE PRESUMPTION IS STRONGLY AGAINST IT BODIES IN THE
DISSECTINGROOMS ARE INJECTED WITH PRESERVATIVE FLUID THESE EARS
BEAR NO SIGNS OF THIS THEY ARE FRESH TOO THEY HAVE BEEN CUT OFF
WITH A BLUNT INSTRUMENT WHICH WOULD HARDLY HAPPEN IF A STUDENT HAD
DONE IT AGAIN CARBOLIC OR RECTIFIED SPIRITS WOULD BE THE
PRESERVATIVES WHICH WOULD SUGGEST THEMSELVES TO THE MEDICAL MIND
CERTAINLY NOT ROUGH SALT I REPEAT THAT THERE IS NO PRACTICAL JOKE
HERE BUT THAT WE ARE INVESTIGATING A SERIOUS CRIME
A VAGUE THRILL RAN THROUGH ME AS I LISTENED TO MY COMPANIONS WORDS
AND SAW THE STERN GRAVITY WHICH HAD HARDENED HIS FEATURES THIS
BRUTAL PRELIMINARY SEEMED TO SHADOW FORTH SOME STRANGE AND
INEXPLICABLE HORROR IN THE BACKGROUND LESTRADE HOWEVER SHOOK HIS
HEAD LIKE A MAN WHO IS ONLY HALF CONVINCED
THERE ARE OBJECTIONS TO THE JOKE THEORY NO DOUBT SAID HE BUT
THERE ARE MUCH STRONGER REASONS AGAINST THE OTHER WE KNOW THAT THIS
WOMAN HAS LED A MOST QUIET AND RESPECTABLE LIFE AT PENGE AND HERE FOR
THE LAST TWENTY YEARS SHE HAS HARDLY BEEN AWAY FROM HER HOME FOR A
DAY DURING THAT TIME WHY ON EARTH THEN SHOULD ANY CRIMINAL SEND
HER THE PROOFS OF HIS GUILT ESPECIALLY AS UNLESS SHE IS A MOST
CONSUMMATE ACTRESS SHE UNDERSTANDS QUITE AS LITTLE OF THE MATTER AS
WE DO
THAT IS THE PROBLEM WHICH WE HAVE TO SOLVE HOLMES ANSWERED AND
FOR MY PART I SHALL SET ABOUT IT BY PRESUMING THAT MY REASONING IS
CORRECT AND THAT A DOUBLE MURDER HAS BEEN COMMITTED ONE OF THESE
EARS IS A WOMANS SMALL FINELY FORMED AND PIERCED FOR AN EARRING
THE OTHER IS A MANS SUNBURNED DISCOLOURED AND ALSO PIERCED FOR
AN EARRING THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE PRESUMABLY DEAD OR WE SHOULD HAVE
HEARD THEIR STORY BEFORE NOW TODAY IS FRIDAY THE PACKET WAS POSTED
ON THURSDAY MORNING THE TRAGEDY THEN OCCURRED ON WEDNESDAY OR
TUESDAY OR EARLIER IF THE TWO PEOPLE WERE MURDERED WHO BUT THEIR
MURDERER WOULD HAVE SENT THIS SIGN OF HIS WORK TO MISS CUSHING WE
MAY TAKE IT THAT THE SENDER OF THE PACKET IS THE MAN WHOM WE WANT
BUT HE MUST HAVE SOME STRONG REASON FOR SENDING MISS CUSHING THIS
PACKET WHAT REASON THEN IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO TELL HER THAT THE DEED
WAS DONE OR TO PAIN HER PERHAPS BUT IN THAT CASE SHE KNOWS WHO IT
IS DOES SHE KNOW I DOUBT IT IF SHE KNEW WHY SHOULD SHE CALL THE
POLICE IN SHE MIGHT HAVE BURIED THE EARS AND NO ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE WISER THAT IS WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE DONE IF SHE HAD WISHED TO
SHIELD THE CRIMINAL BUT IF SHE DOES NOT WISH TO SHIELD HIM SHE WOULD
GIVE HIS NAME THERE IS A TANGLE HERE WHICH NEEDS STRAIGHTENING OUT
HE HAD BEEN TALKING IN A HIGH QUICK VOICE STARING BLANKLY UP OVER
THE GARDEN FENCE BUT NOW HE SPRANG BRISKLY TO HIS FEET AND WALKED
TOWARDS THE HOUSE
I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS TO ASK MISS CUSHING SAID HE
IN THAT CASE I MAY LEAVE YOU HERE SAID LESTRADE FOR I HAVE
ANOTHER SMALL BUSINESS ON HAND I THINK THAT I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER
TO LEARN FROM MISS CUSHING YOU WILL FIND ME AT THE POLICESTATION
WE SHALL LOOK IN ON OUR WAY TO THE TRAIN ANSWERED HOLMES A MOMENT
LATER HE AND I WERE BACK IN THE FRONT ROOM WHERE THE IMPASSIVE LADY
WAS STILL QUIETLY WORKING AWAY AT HER ANTIMACASSAR SHE PUT IT DOWN
ON HER LAP AS WE ENTERED AND LOOKED AT US WITH HER FRANK SEARCHING
BLUE EYES
I AM CONVINCED SIR SHE SAID THAT THIS MATTER IS A MISTAKE AND
THAT THE PARCEL WAS NEVER MEANT FOR ME AT ALL I HAVE SAID THIS
SEVERAL TIMES TO THE GENTLEMEN FROM SCOTLAND YARD BUT HE SIMPLY
LAUGHS AT ME I HAVE NOT AN ENEMY IN THE WORLD AS FAR AS I KNOW SO
WHY SHOULD ANYONE PLAY ME SUCH A TRICK
I AM COMING TO BE OF THE SAME OPINION MISS CUSHING SAID HOLMES
TAKING A SEAT BESIDE HER I THINK THAT IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE
HE PAUSED AND I WAS SURPRISED ON GLANCING ROUND TO SEE THAT HE WAS
STARING WITH SINGULAR INTENTNESS AT THE LADYS PROFILE SURPRISE AND
SATISFACTION WERE BOTH FOR AN INSTANT TO BE READ UPON HIS EAGER FACE
THOUGH WHEN SHE GLANCED ROUND TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF HIS SILENCE HE
HAD BECOME AS DEMURE AS EVER I STARED HARD MYSELF AT HER FLAT
GRIZZLED HAIR HER TRIM CAP HER LITTLE GILT EARRINGS HER PLACID
FEATURES BUT I COULD SEE NOTHING WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR MY
COMPANIONS EVIDENT EXCITEMENT
THERE WERE ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS
OH I AM WEARY OF QUESTIONS CRIED MISS CUSHING IMPATIENTLY
YOU HAVE TWO SISTERS I BELIEVE
HOW COULD YOU KNOW THAT
I OBSERVED THE VERY INSTANT THAT I ENTERED THE ROOM THAT YOU HAVE A
PORTRAIT GROUP OF THREE LADIES UPON THE MANTELPIECE ONE OF WHOM IS
UNDOUBTEDLY YOURSELF WHILE THE OTHERS ARE SO EXCEEDINGLY LIKE YOU
THAT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF THE RELATIONSHIP
YES YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT THOSE ARE MY SISTERS SARAH AND MARY
AND HERE AT MY ELBOW IS ANOTHER PORTRAIT TAKEN AT LIVERPOOL OF
YOUR YOUNGER SISTER IN THE COMPANY OF A MAN WHO APPEARS TO BE A
STEWARD BY HIS UNIFORM I OBSERVE THAT SHE WAS UNMARRIED AT THE
TIME
YOU ARE VERY QUICK AT OBSERVING
THAT IS MY TRADE
WELL YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT BUT SHE WAS MARRIED TO MR BROWNER A FEW
DAYS AFTERWARDS HE WAS ON THE SOUTH AMERICAN LINE WHEN THAT WAS
TAKEN BUT HE WAS SO FOND OF HER THAT HE COULDNT ABIDE TO LEAVE HER
FOR SO LONG AND HE GOT INTO THE LIVERPOOL AND LONDON BOATS
AH THE CONQUEROR PERHAPS
NO THE MAY DAY WHEN LAST I HEARD JIM CAME DOWN HERE TO SEE ME
ONCE THAT WAS BEFORE HE BROKE THE PLEDGE BUT AFTERWARDS HE WOULD
ALWAYS TAKE DRINK WHEN HE WAS ASHORE AND A LITTLE DRINK WOULD SEND
HIM STARK STARING MAD AH IT WAS A BAD DAY THAT EVER HE TOOK A
GLASS IN HIS HAND AGAIN FIRST HE DROPPED ME THEN HE QUARRELLED WITH
SARAH AND NOW THAT MARY HAS STOPPED WRITING WE DONT KNOW HOW THINGS
ARE GOING WITH THEM
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MISS CUSHING HAD COME UPON A SUBJECT ON WHICH SHE
FELT VERY DEEPLY LIKE MOST PEOPLE WHO LEAD A LONELY LIFE SHE WAS
SHY AT FIRST BUT ENDED BY BECOMING EXTREMELY COMMUNICATIVE SHE TOLD
US MANY DETAILS ABOUT HER BROTHERINLAW THE STEWARD AND THEN
WANDERING OFF ON THE SUBJECT OF HER FORMER LODGERS THE MEDICAL
STUDENTS SHE GAVE US A LONG ACCOUNT OF THEIR DELINQUENCIES WITH
THEIR NAMES AND THOSE OF THEIR HOSPITALS HOLMES LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
TO EVERYTHING THROWING IN A QUESTION FROM TIME TO TIME
ABOUT YOUR SECOND SISTER SARAH SAID HE I WONDER SINCE YOU ARE
BOTH MAIDEN LADIES THAT YOU DO NOT KEEP HOUSE TOGETHER
AH YOU DONT KNOW SARAHS TEMPER OR YOU WOULD WONDER NO MORE I
TRIED IT WHEN I CAME TO CROYDON AND WE KEPT ON UNTIL ABOUT TWO
MONTHS AGO WHEN WE HAD TO PART I DONT WANT TO SAY A WORD AGAINST
MY OWN SISTER BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS MEDDLESOME AND HARD TO PLEASE WAS
SARAH
YOU SAY THAT SHE QUARRELLED WITH YOUR LIVERPOOL RELATIONS
YES AND THEY WERE THE BEST OF FRIENDS AT ONE TIME WHY SHE WENT UP
THERE TO LIVE IN ORDER TO BE NEAR THEM AND NOW SHE HAS NO WORD HARD
ENOUGH FOR JIM BROWNER THE LAST SIX MONTHS THAT SHE WAS HERE SHE
WOULD SPEAK OF NOTHING BUT HIS DRINKING AND HIS WAYS HE HAD CAUGHT
HER MEDDLING I SUSPECT AND GIVEN HER A BIT OF HIS MIND AND THAT
WAS THE START OF IT
THANK YOU MISS CUSHING SAID HOLMES RISING AND BOWING YOUR
SISTER SARAH LIVES I THINK YOU SAID AT NEW STREET WALLINGTON
GOODBYE AND I AM VERY SORRY THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN TROUBLED OVER
A CASE WITH WHICH AS YOU SAY YOU HAVE NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO
THERE WAS A CAB PASSING AS WE CAME OUT AND HOLMES HAILED IT
HOW FAR TO WALLINGTON HE ASKED
ONLY ABOUT A MILE SIR
VERY GOOD JUMP IN WATSON WE MUST STRIKE WHILE THE IRON IS HOT
SIMPLE AS THE CASE IS THERE HAVE BEEN ONE OR TWO VERY INSTRUCTIVE
DETAILS IN CONNECTION WITH IT JUST PULL UP AT A TELEGRAPH OFFICE AS
YOU PASS CABBY
HOLMES SENT OFF A SHORT WIRE AND FOR THE REST OF THE DRIVE LAY BACK
IN THE CAB WITH HIS HAT TILTED OVER HIS NOSE TO KEEP THE SUN FROM
HIS FACE OUR DRIVE PULLED UP AT A HOUSE WHICH WAS NOT UNLIKE THE ONE
WHICH WE HAD JUST QUITTED MY COMPANION ORDERED HIM TO WAIT AND HAD
HIS HAND UPON THE KNOCKER WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND A GRAVE YOUNG
GENTLEMAN IN BLACK WITH A VERY SHINY HAT APPEARED ON THE STEP
IS MISS CUSHING AT HOME ASKED HOLMES
MISS SARAH CUSHING IS EXTREMELY ILL SAID HE SHE HAS BEEN
SUFFERING SINCE YESTERDAY FROM BRAIN SYMPTOMS OF GREAT SEVERITY AS
HER MEDICAL ADVISER I CANNOT POSSIBLY TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
ALLOWING ANYONE TO SEE HER I SHOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO CALL AGAIN IN
TEN DAYS HE DREW ON HIS GLOVES CLOSED THE DOOR AND MARCHED OFF
DOWN THE STREET
WELL IF WE CANT WE CANT SAID HOLMES CHEERFULLY
PERHAPS SHE COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT HAVE TOLD YOU MUCH
I DID NOT WISH HER TO TELL ME ANYTHING I ONLY WANTED TO LOOK AT
HER HOWEVER I THINK THAT I HAVE GOT ALL THAT I WANT DRIVE US TO
SOME DECENT HOTEL CABBY WHERE WE MAY HAVE SOME LUNCH AND
AFTERWARDS WE SHALL DROP DOWN UPON FRIEND LESTRADE AT THE
POLICESTATION
WE HAD A PLEASANT LITTLE MEAL TOGETHER DURING WHICH HOLMES WOULD
TALK ABOUT NOTHING BUT VIOLINS NARRATING WITH GREAT EXULTATION HOW
HE HAD PURCHASED HIS OWN STRADIVARIUS WHICH WAS WORTH AT LEAST FIVE
HUNDRED GUINEAS AT A JEW BROKERS IN TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD FOR
FIFTYFIVE SHILLINGS THIS LED HIM TO PAGANINI AND WE SAT FOR AN
HOUR OVER A BOTTLE OF CLARET WHILE HE TOLD ME ANECDOTE AFTER ANECDOTE
OF THAT EXTRAORDINARY MAN THE AFTERNOON WAS FAR ADVANCED AND THE HOT
GLARE HAD SOFTENED INTO A MELLOW GLOW BEFORE WE FOUND OURSELVES AT
THE POLICESTATION LESTRADE WAS WAITING FOR US AT THE DOOR
A TELEGRAM FOR YOU MR HOLMES SAID HE
HA IT IS THE ANSWER HE TORE IT OPEN GLANCED HIS EYES OVER IT
AND CRUMPLED IT INTO HIS POCKET THATS ALL RIGHT SAID HE
HAVE YOU FOUND OUT ANYTHING
I HAVE FOUND OUT EVERYTHING
WHAT LESTRADE STARED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT YOU ARE JOKING
I WAS NEVER MORE SERIOUS IN MY LIFE A SHOCKING CRIME HAS BEEN
COMMITTED AND I THINK I HAVE NOW LAID BARE EVERY DETAIL OF IT
AND THE CRIMINAL
HOLMES SCRIBBLED A FEW WORDS UPON THE BACK OF ONE OF HIS VISITING
CARDS AND THREW IT OVER TO LESTRADE
THAT IS THE NAME HE SAID YOU CANNOT EFFECT AN ARREST UNTIL
TOMORROW NIGHT AT THE EARLIEST I SHOULD PREFER THAT YOU DO NOT
MENTION MY NAME AT ALL IN CONNECTION WITH THE CASE AS I CHOOSE TO BE
ONLY ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE CRIMES WHICH PRESENT SOME DIFFICULTY IN
THEIR SOLUTION COME ON WATSON WE STRODE OFF TOGETHER TO THE
STATION LEAVING LESTRADE STILL STARING WITH A DELIGHTED FACE AT THE
CARD WHICH HOLMES HAD THROWN HIM
THE CASE SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES AS WE CHATTED OVER OR CIGARS THAT
NIGHT IN OUR ROOMS AT BAKER STREET IS ONE WHERE AS IN THE
INVESTIGATIONS WHICH YOU HAVE CHRONICLED UNDER THE NAMES OF A STUDY
IN SCARLET AND OF THE SIGN OF FOUR WE HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO
REASON BACKWARD FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES I HAVE WRITTEN TO LESTRADE
ASKING HIM TO SUPPLY US WITH THE DETAILS WHICH ARE NOW WANTING AND
WHICH HE WILL ONLY GET AFTER HE HAD SECURED HIS MAN THAT HE MAY BE
SAFELY TRUSTED TO DO FOR ALTHOUGH HE IS ABSOLUTELY DEVOID OF REASON
HE IS AS TENACIOUS AS A BULLDOG WHEN HE ONCE UNDERSTANDS WHAT HE HAS
TO DO AND INDEED IT IS JUST THIS TENACITY WHICH HAS BROUGHT HIM TO
THE TOP AT SCOTLAND YARD
YOUR CASE IS NOT COMPLETE THEN I ASKED
IT IS FAIRLY COMPLETE IN ESSENTIALS WE KNOW WHO THE AUTHOR OF THE
REVOLTING BUSINESS IS ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE VICTIMS STILL ESCAPES US
OF COURSE YOU HAVE FORMED YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS
I PRESUME THAT THIS JIM BROWNER THE STEWARD OF A LIVERPOOL BOAT IS
THE MAN WHOM YOU SUSPECT
OH IT IS MORE THAN A SUSPICION
AND YET I CANNOT SEE ANYTHING SAVE VERY VAGUE INDICATIONS
ON THE CONTRARY TO MY MIND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CLEAR LET ME RUN
OVER THE PRINCIPAL STEPS WE APPROACHED THE CASE YOU REMEMBER WITH
AN ABSOLUTELY BLANK MIND WHICH IS ALWAYS AN ADVANTAGE WE HAD FORMED
NO THEORIES WE WERE SIMPLY THERE TO OBSERVE AND TO DRAW INFERENCES
FROM OUR OBSERVATIONS WHAT DID WE SEE FIRST A VERY PLACID AND
RESPECTABLE LADY WHO SEEMED QUITE INNOCENT OF ANY SECRET AND A
PORTRAIT WHICH SHOWED ME THAT SHE HAD TWO YOUNGER SISTERS IT
INSTANTLY FLASHED ACROSS MY MIND THAT THE BOX MIGHT HAVE BEEN MEANT
FOR ONE OF THESE I SET THE IDEA ASIDE AS ONE WHICH COULD BE
DISPROVED OR CONFIRMED AT OUR LEISURE THEN WE WENT TO THE GARDEN AS
YOU REMEMBER AND WE SAW THE VERY SINGULAR CONTENTS OF THE LITTLE
YELLOW BOX
THE STRING WAS OF THE QUALITY WHICH IS USED BY SAILMAKERS ABOARD
SHIP AND AT ONCE A WHIFF OF THE SEA WAS PERCEPTIBLE IN OUR
INVESTIGATION WHEN I OBSERVED THAT THE KNOT WAS ONE WHICH IS POPULAR
WITH SAILORS THAT THE PARCEL HAD BEEN POSTED AT A PORT AND THAT THE
MALE EAR WAS PIERCED FOR AN EARRING WHICH IS SO MUCH MORE COMMON
AMONG SAILORS THAN LANDSMEN I WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT ALL THE ACTORS
IN THE TRAGEDY WERE TO BE FOUND AMONG OUR SEAFARING CLASSES
WHEN I CAME TO EXAMINE THE ADDRESS OF THE PACKET I OBSERVED THAT IT
WAS TO MISS S CUSHING NOW THE OLDEST SISTER WOULD OF COURSE BE
MISS CUSHING AND ALTHOUGH HER INITIAL WAS S IT MIGHT BELONG TO ONE
OF THE OTHERS AS WELL IN THAT CASE WE SHOULD HAVE TO COMMENCE OUR
INVESTIGATION FROM A FRESH BASIS ALTOGETHER I THEREFORE WENT INTO
THE HOUSE WITH THE INTENTION OF CLEARING UP THIS POINT I WAS ABOUT
TO ASSURE MISS CUSHING THAT I WAS CONVINCED THAT A MISTAKE HAD BEEN
MADE WHEN YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT I CAME SUDDENLY TO A STOP THE FACT
WAS THAT I HAD JUST SEEN SOMETHING WHICH FILLED ME WITH SURPRISE AND
AT THE SAME TIME NARROWED THE FIELD OF OUR INQUIRY IMMENSELY
AS A MEDICAL MAN YOU ARE AWARE WATSON THAT THERE IS NO PART OF
THE BODY WHICH VARIES SO MUCH AS THE HUMAN EAR EACH EAR IS AS A RULE
QUITE DISTINCTIVE AND DIFFERS FROM ALL OTHER ONES IN LAST YEARS
ANTHROPOLOGICAL JOURNAL YOU WILL FIND TWO SHORT MONOGRAPHS FROM MY
PEN UPON THE SUBJECT I HAD THEREFORE EXAMINED THE EARS IN THE BOX
WITH THE EYES OF AN EXPERT AND HAD CAREFULLY NOTED THEIR ANATOMICAL
PECULIARITIES IMAGINE MY SURPRISE THEN WHEN ON LOOKING AT MISS
CUSHING I PERCEIVED THAT HER EAR CORRESPONDED EXACTLY WITH THE FEMALE
EAR WHICH I HAD JUST INSPECTED THE MATTER WAS ENTIRELY BEYOND
COINCIDENCE THERE WAS THE SAME SHORTENING OF THE PINNA THE SAME
BROAD CURVE OF THE UPPER LOBE THE SAME CONVOLUTION OF THE INNER
CARTILAGE IN ALL ESSENTIALS IT WAS THE SAME EAR
IN THE FIRST PLACE HER SISTERS NAME WAS SARAH AND HER ADDRESS HAD
UNTIL RECENTLY BEEN THE SAME SO THAT IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUS HOW THE
MISTAKE HAD OCCURRED AND FOR WHOM THE PACKET WAS MEANT THEN WE HEARD
OF THIS STEWARD MARRIED TO THE THIRD SISTER AND LEARNED THAT HE HAD
AT ONE TIME BEEN SO INTIMATE WITH MISS SARAH THAT SHE HAD ACTUALLY
GONE UP TO LIVERPOOL TO BE NEAR THE BROWNERS BUT A QUARREL HAD
AFTERWARDS DIVIDED THEM THIS QUARREL HAD PUT A STOP TO ALL
COMMUNICATIONS FOR SOME MONTHS SO THAT IF BROWNER HAD OCCASION TO
ADDRESS A PACKET TO MISS SARAH HE WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE DONE SO TO
HER OLD ADDRESS
AND NOW THE MATTER HAD BEGUN TO STRAIGHTEN ITSELF OUT WONDERFULLY
WE HAD LEARNED OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS STEWARD AN IMPULSIVE MAN OF
STRONG PASSIONSYOU REMEMBER THAT HE THREW UP WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN A
VERY SUPERIOR BERTH IN ORDER TO BE NEARER TO HIS WIFESUBJECT TOO
TO OCCASIONAL FITS OF HARD DRINKING WE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT
HIS WIFE HAD BEEN MURDERED AND THAT A MANPRESUMABLY A SEAFARING
MANHAD BEEN MURDERED AT THE SAME TIME JEALOUSY OF COURSE AT ONCE
SUGGESTS ITSELF AS THE MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME AND WHY SHOULD THESE
PROOFS OF THE DEED BE SENT TO MISS SARAH CUSHING PROBABLY BECAUSE
DURING HER RESIDENCE IN LIVERPOOL SHE HAD SOME HAND IN BRINGING ABOUT
THE EVENTS WHICH LED TO THE TRAGEDY YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT THIS LINE
OF BOATS CALL AT BELFAST DUBLIN AND WATERFORD SO THAT PRESUMING
THAT BROWNER HAD COMMITTED THE DEED AND HAD EMBARKED AT ONCE UPON HIS
STEAMER THE MAY DAY BELFAST WOULD BE THE FIRST PLACE AT WHICH HE
COULD POST HIS TERRIBLE PACKET
A SECOND SOLUTION WAS AT THIS STAGE OBVIOUSLY POSSIBLE AND ALTHOUGH
I THOUGHT IT EXCEEDINGLY UNLIKELY I WAS DETERMINED TO ELUCIDATE IT
BEFORE GOING FURTHER AN UNSUCCESSFUL LOVER MIGHT HAVE KILLED MR AND
MRS BROWNER AND THE MALE EAR MIGHT HAVE BELONGED TO THE HUSBAND
THERE WERE MANY GRAVE OBJECTIONS TO THIS THEORY BUT IT WAS
CONCEIVABLE I THEREFORE SENT OFF A TELEGRAM TO MY FRIEND ALGAR OF
THE LIVERPOOL FORCE AND ASKED HIM TO FIND OUT IF MRS BROWNER WERE
AT HOME AND IF BROWNER HAD DEPARTED IN THE MAY DAY THEN WE WENT ON
TO WALLINGTON TO VISIT MISS SARAH
I WAS CURIOUS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO SEE HOW FAR THE FAMILY EAR HAD
BEEN REPRODUCED IN HER THEN OF COURSE SHE MIGHT GIVE US VERY
IMPORTANT INFORMATION BUT I WAS NOT SANGUINE THAT SHE WOULD SHE
MUST HAVE HEARD OF THE BUSINESS THE DAY BEFORE SINCE ALL CROYDON WAS
RINGING WITH IT AND SHE ALONE COULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD FOR WHOM THE
PACKET WAS MEANT IF SHE HAD BEEN WILLING TO HELP JUSTICE SHE WOULD
PROBABLY HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH THE POLICE ALREADY HOWEVER IT WAS
CLEARLY OUR DUTY TO SEE HER SO WE WENT WE FOUND THAT THE NEWS OF
THE ARRIVAL OF THE PACKETFOR HER ILLNESS DATED FROM THAT TIMEHAD
SUCH AN EFFECT UPON HER AS TO BRING ON BRAIN FEVER IT WAS CLEARER
THAN EVER THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD ITS FULL SIGNIFICANCE BUT EQUALLY
CLEAR THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT SOME TIME FOR ANY ASSISTANCE FROM
HER
HOWEVER WE WERE REALLY INDEPENDENT OF HER HELP OUR ANSWERS WERE
WAITING FOR US AT THE POLICESTATION WHERE I HAD DIRECTED ALGAR TO
SEND THEM NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONCLUSIVE MRS BROWNERS HOUSE HAD
BEEN CLOSED FOR MORE THAN THREE DAYS AND THE NEIGHBOURS WERE OF
OPINION THAT SHE HAD GONE SOUTH TO SEE HER RELATIVES IT HAD BEEN
ASCERTAINED AT THE SHIPPING OFFICES THAT BROWNER HAD LEFT ABOARD OF
THE MAY DAY AND I CALCULATE THAT SHE IS DUE IN THE THAMES TOMORROW
NIGHT WHEN HE ARRIVES HE WILL BE MET BY THE OBTUSE BUT RESOLUTE
LESTRADE AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE SHALL HAVE ALL OUR DETAILS
FILLED IN
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED IN HIS EXPECTATIONS TWO DAYS
LATER HE RECEIVED A BULKY ENVELOPE WHICH CONTAINED A SHORT NOTE FROM
THE DETECTIVE AND A TYPEWRITTEN DOCUMENT WHICH COVERED SEVERAL
PAGES OF FOOLSCAP
LESTRADE HAS GOT HIM ALL RIGHT SAID HOLMES GLANCING UP AT ME
PERHAPS IT WOULD INTEREST YOU TO HEAR WHAT HE SAYS
MY DEAR MR HOLMES
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SCHEME WHICH WE HAD FORMED IN ORDER TO TEST
OUR THEORIES THE WE IS RATHER FINE WATSON IS IT NOT I WENT
DOWN TO THE ALBERT DOCK YESTERDAY AT PM AND BOARDED THE SS MAY
DAY BELONGING TO THE LIVERPOOL DUBLIN AND LONDON STEAM PACKET
COMPANY ON INQUIRY I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A STEWARD ON BOARD OF THE
NAME OF JAMES BROWNER AND THAT HE HAD ACTED DURING THE VOYAGE IN SUCH
AN EXTRAORDINARY MANNER THAT THE CAPTAIN HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO
RELIEVE HIM OF HIS DUTIES ON DESCENDING TO HIS BERTH I FOUND HIM
SEATED UPON A CHEST WITH HIS HEAD SUNK UPON HIS HANDS ROCKING
HIMSELF TO AND FRO HE IS A BIG POWERFUL CHAP CLEANSHAVEN AND
VERY SWARTHYSOMETHING LIKE ALDRIGE WHO HELPED US IN THE BOGUS
LAUNDRY AFFAIR HE JUMPED UP WHEN HE HEARD MY BUSINESS AND I HAD MY
WHISTLE TO MY LIPS TO CALL A COUPLE OF RIVER POLICE WHO WERE ROUND
THE CORNER BUT HE SEEMED TO HAVE NO HEART IN HIM AND HE HELD OUT
HIS HANDS QUIETLY ENOUGH FOR THE DARBIES WE BROUGHT HIM ALONG TO THE
CELLS AND HIS BOX AS WELL FOR WE THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING
INCRIMINATING BUT BAR A BIG SHARP KNIFE SUCH AS MOST SAILORS HAVE
WE GOT NOTHING FOR OUR TROUBLE HOWEVER WE FIND THAT WE SHALL WANT
NO MORE EVIDENCE FOR ON BEING BROUGHT BEFORE THE INSPECTOR AT THE
STATION HE ASKED LEAVE TO MAKE A STATEMENT WHICH WAS OF COURSE
TAKEN DOWN JUST AS HE MADE IT BY OUR SHORTHAND MAN WE HAD THREE
COPIES TYPEWRITTEN ONE OF WHICH I ENCLOSE THE AFFAIR PROVES AS I
ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD TO BE AN EXTREMELY SIMPLE ONE BUT I AM
OBLIGED TO YOU FOR ASSISTING ME IN MY INVESTIGATION WITH KIND
REGARDS
YOURS VERY TRULY
G LESTRADE
HUM THE INVESTIGATION REALLY WAS A VERY SIMPLE ONE REMARKED
HOLMES BUT I DONT THINK IT STRUCK HIM IN THAT LIGHT WHEN HE FIRST
CALLED US IN HOWEVER LET US SEE WHAT JIM BROWNER HAS TO SAY FOR
HIMSELF THIS IS HIS STATEMENT AS MADE BEFORE INSPECTOR MONTGOMERY AT
THE SHADWELL POLICE STATION AND IT HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING
VERBATIM
HAVE I ANYTHING TO SAY YES I HAVE A DEAL TO SAY I HAVE TO MAKE A
CLEAN BREAST OF IT ALL YOU CAN HANG ME OR YOU CAN LEAVE ME ALONE I
DONT CARE A PLUG WHICH YOU DO I TELL YOU IVE NOT SHUT AN EYE IN
SLEEP SINCE I DID IT AND I DONT BELIEVE I EVER WILL AGAIN UNTIL I
GET PAST ALL WAKING SOMETIMES ITS HIS FACE BUT MOST GENERALLY ITS
HERS IM NEVER WITHOUT ONE OR THE OTHER BEFORE ME HE LOOKS FROWNING
AND BLACKLIKE BUT SHE HAS A KIND O SURPRISE UPON HER FACE AY THE
WHITE LAMB SHE MIGHT WELL BE SURPRISED WHEN SHE READ DEATH ON A FACE
THAT HAD SELDOM LOOKED ANYTHING BUT LOVE UPON HER BEFORE
BUT IT WAS SARAHS FAULT AND MAY THE CURSE OF A BROKEN MAN PUT A
BLIGHT ON HER AND SET THE BLOOD ROTTING IN HER VEINS ITS NOT THAT I
WANT TO CLEAR MYSELF I KNOW THAT I WENT BACK TO DRINK LIKE THE
BEAST THAT I WAS BUT SHE WOULD HAVE FORGIVEN ME SHE WOULD HAVE
STUCK AS CLOSE TO ME AS A ROPE TO A BLOCK IF THAT WOMAN HAD NEVER
DARKENED OUR DOOR FOR SARAH CUSHING LOVED METHATS THE ROOT OF THE
BUSINESSSHE LOVED ME UNTIL ALL HER LOVE TURNED TO POISONOUS HATE
WHEN SHE KNEW THAT I THOUGHT MORE OF MY WIFES FOOTMARK IN THE MUD
THAN I DID OF HER WHOLE BODY AND SOUL
THERE WERE THREE SISTERS ALTOGETHER THE OLD ONE WAS JUST A GOOD
WOMAN THE SECOND WAS A DEVIL AND THE THIRD WAS AN ANGEL SARAH WAS
THIRTYTHREE AND MARY WAS TWENTYNINE WHEN I MARRIED WE WERE JUST
AS HAPPY AS THE DAY WAS LONG WHEN WE SET UP HOUSE TOGETHER AND IN
ALL LIVERPOOL THERE WAS NO BETTER WOMAN THAN MY MARY AND THEN WE
ASKED SARAH UP FOR A WEEK AND THE WEEK GREW INTO A MONTH AND ONE
THING LED TO ANOTHER UNTIL SHE WAS JUST ONE OF OURSELVES
I WAS BLUE RIBBON AT THAT TIME AND WE WERE PUTTING A LITTLE MONEY
BY AND ALL WAS AS BRIGHT AS A NEW DOLLAR MY GOD WHOEVER WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT THAT IT COULD HAVE COME TO THIS WHOEVER WOULD HAVE DREAMED
IT
I USED TO BE HOME FOR THE WEEKENDS VERY OFTEN AND SOMETIMES IF
THE SHIP WERE HELD BACK FOR CARGO I WOULD HAVE A WHOLE WEEK AT A
TIME AND IN THIS WAY I SAW A DEAL OF MY SISTERINLAW SARAH SHE
WAS A FINE TALL WOMAN BLACK AND QUICK AND FIERCE WITH A PROUD WAY
OF CARRYING HER HEAD AND A GLINT FROM HER EYE LIKE A SPARK FROM A
FLINT BUT WHEN LITTLE MARY WAS THERE I HAD NEVER A THOUGHT OF HER
AND THAT I SWEAR AS I HOPE FOR GODS MERCY
IT HAD SEEMED TO ME SOMETIMES THAT SHE LIKED TO BE ALONE WITH ME
OR TO COAX ME OUT FOR A WALK WITH HER BUT I HAD NEVER THOUGHT
ANYTHING OF THAT BUT ONE EVENING MY EYES WERE OPENED I HAD COME UP
FROM THE SHIP AND FOUND MY WIFE OUT BUT SARAH AT HOME WHERES
MARY I ASKED OH SHE HAS GONE TO PAY SOME ACCOUNTS I WAS
IMPATIENT AND PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM CANT YOU BE HAPPY FOR
FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT MARY JIM SAYS SHE ITS A BAD COMPLIMENT TO
ME THAT YOU CANT BE CONTENTED WITH MY SOCIETY FOR SO SHORT A TIME
THATS ALL RIGHT MY LASS SAID I PUTTING OUT MY HAND TOWARDS HER
IN A KINDLY WAY BUT SHE HAD IT IN BOTH HERS IN AN INSTANT AND THEY
BURNED AS IF THEY WERE IN A FEVER I LOOKED INTO HER EYES AND I READ
IT ALL THERE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR HER TO SPEAK NOR FOR ME EITHER
I FROWNED AND DREW MY HAND AWAY THEN SHE STOOD BY MY SIDE IN SILENCE
FOR A BIT AND THEN PUT UP HER HAND AND PATTED ME ON THE SHOULDER
STEADY OLD JIM SAID SHE AND WITH A KIND O MOCKING LAUGH SHE RAN
OUT OF THE ROOM
WELL FROM THAT TIME SARAH HATED ME WITH HER WHOLE HEART AND SOUL
AND SHE IS A WOMAN WHO CAN HATE TOO I WAS A FOOL TO LET HER GO ON
BIDING WITH USA BESOTTED FOOLBUT I NEVER SAID A WORD TO MARY FOR
I KNEW IT WOULD GRIEVE HER THINGS WENT ON MUCH AS BEFORE BUT AFTER
A TIME I BEGAN TO FIND THAT THERE WAS A BIT OF A CHANGE IN MARY
HERSELF SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN SO TRUSTING AND SO INNOCENT BUT NOW SHE
BECAME QUEER AND SUSPICIOUS WANTING TO KNOW WHERE I HAD BEEN AND
WHAT I HAD BEEN DOING AND WHOM MY LETTERS WERE FROM AND WHAT I HAD
IN MY POCKETS AND A THOUSAND SUCH FOLLIES DAY BY DAY SHE GREW
QUEERER AND MORE IRRITABLE AND WE HAD CEASELESS ROWS ABOUT NOTHING
I WAS FAIRLY PUZZLED BY IT ALL SARAH AVOIDED ME NOW BUT SHE AND
MARY WERE JUST INSEPARABLE I CAN SEE NOW HOW SHE WAS PLOTTING AND
SCHEMING AND POISONING MY WIFES MIND AGAINST ME BUT I WAS SUCH A
BLIND BEETLE THAT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT AT THE TIME THEN I BROKE
MY BLUE RIBBON AND BEGAN TO DRINK AGAIN BUT I THINK I SHOULD NOT
HAVE DONE IT IF MARY HAD BEEN THE SAME AS EVER SHE HAD SOME REASON
TO BE DISGUSTED WITH ME NOW AND THE GAP BETWEEN US BEGAN TO BE WIDER
AND WIDER AND THEN THIS ALEC FAIRBAIRN CHIPPED IN AND THINGS BECAME
A THOUSAND TIMES BLACKER
IT WAS TO SEE SARAH THAT HE CAME TO MY HOUSE FIRST BUT SOON IT WAS
TO SEE US FOR HE WAS A MAN WITH WINNING WAYS AND HE MADE FRIENDS
WHEREVER HE WENT HE WAS A DASHING SWAGGERING CHAP SMART AND
CURLED WHO HAD SEEN HALF THE WORLD AND COULD TALK OF WHAT HE HAD
SEEN HE WAS GOOD COMPANY I WONT DENY IT AND HE HAD WONDERFUL
POLITE WAYS WITH HIM FOR A SAILOR MAN SO THAT I THINK THERE MUST
HAVE BEEN A TIME WHEN HE KNEW MORE OF THE POOP THAN THE FORECASTLE
FOR A MONTH HE WAS IN AND OUT OF MY HOUSE AND NEVER ONCE DID IT
CROSS MY MIND THAT HARM MIGHT COME OF HIS SOFT TRICKY WAYS AND THEN
AT LAST SOMETHING MADE ME SUSPECT AND FROM THAT DAY MY PEACE WAS
GONE FOREVER
IT WAS ONLY A LITTLE THING TOO I HAD COME INTO THE PARLOUR
UNEXPECTED AND AS I WALKED IN AT THE DOOR I SAW A LIGHT OF WELCOME
ON MY WIFES FACE BUT AS SHE SAW WHO IT WAS IT FADED AGAIN AND SHE
TURNED AWAY WITH A LOOK OF DISAPPOINTMENT THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME
THERE WAS NO ONE BUT ALEC FAIRBAIRN WHOSE STEP SHE COULD HAVE
MISTAKEN FOR MINE IF I COULD HAVE SEEN HIM THEN I SHOULD HAVE KILLED
HIM FOR I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LIKE A MADMAN WHEN MY TEMPER GETS LOOSE
MARY SAW THE DEVILS LIGHT IN MY EYES AND SHE RAN FORWARD WITH HER
HANDS ON MY SLEEVE DONT JIM DONT SAYS SHE WHERES SARAH I
ASKED IN THE KITCHEN SAYS SHE SARAH SAYS I AS I WENT IN
THIS MAN FAIRBAIRN IS NEVER TO DARKEN MY DOOR AGAIN WHY NOT
SAYS SHE BECAUSE I ORDER IT OH SAYS SHE IF MY FRIENDS ARE
NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS HOUSE THEN I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR IT
EITHER YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE SAYS I BUT IF FAIRBAIRN SHOWS
HIS FACE HERE AGAIN ILL SEND YOU ONE OF HIS EARS FOR A KEEPSAKE
SHE WAS FRIGHTENED BY MY FACE I THINK FOR SHE NEVER ANSWERED A
WORD AND THE SAME EVENING SHE LEFT MY HOUSE
WELL I DONT KNOW NOW WHETHER IT WAS PURE DEVILRY ON THE PART OF
THIS WOMAN OR WHETHER SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD TURN ME AGAINST MY
WIFE BY ENCOURAGING HER TO MISBEHAVE ANYWAY SHE TOOK A HOUSE JUST
TWO STREETS OFF AND LET LODGINGS TO SAILORS FAIRBAIRN USED TO STAY
THERE AND MARY WOULD GO ROUND TO HAVE TEA WITH HER SISTER AND HIM
HOW OFTEN SHE WENT I DONT KNOW BUT I FOLLOWED HER ONE DAY AND AS I
BROKE IN AT THE DOOR FAIRBAIRN GOT AWAY OVER THE BACK GARDEN WALL
LIKE THE COWARDLY SKUNK THAT HE WAS I SWORE TO MY WIFE THAT I WOULD
KILL HER IF I FOUND HER IN HIS COMPANY AGAIN AND I LED HER BACK WITH
ME SOBBING AND TREMBLING AND AS WHITE AS A PIECE OF PAPER THERE
WAS NO TRACE OF LOVE BETWEEN US ANY LONGER I COULD SEE THAT SHE
HATED ME AND FEARED ME AND WHEN THE THOUGHT OF IT DROVE ME TO DRINK
THEN SHE DESPISED ME AS WELL
WELL SARAH FOUND THAT SHE COULD NOT MAKE A LIVING IN LIVERPOOL SO
SHE WENT BACK AS I UNDERSTAND TO LIVE WITH HER SISTER IN CROYDON
AND THINGS JOGGED ON MUCH THE SAME AS EVER AT HOME AND THEN CAME
THIS WEEK AND ALL THE MISERY AND RUIN
IT WAS IN THIS WAY WE HAD GONE ON THE MAY DAY FOR A ROUND VOYAGE
OF SEVEN DAYS BUT A HOGSHEAD GOT LOOSE AND STARTED ONE OF OUR
PLATES SO THAT WE HAD TO PUT BACK INTO PORT FOR TWELVE HOURS I LEFT
THE SHIP AND CAME HOME THINKING WHAT A SURPRISE IT WOULD BE FOR MY
WIFE AND HOPING THAT MAYBE SHE WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE ME SO SOON THE
THOUGHT WAS IN MY HEAD AS I TURNED INTO MY OWN STREET AND AT THAT
MOMENT A CAB PASSED ME AND THERE SHE WAS SITTING BY THE SIDE OF
FAIRBAIRN THE TWO CHATTING AND LAUGHING WITH NEVER A THOUGHT FOR ME
AS I STOOD WATCHING THEM FROM THE FOOTPATH
I TELL YOU AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD FOR IT THAT FROM THAT MOMENT I
WAS NOT MY OWN MASTER AND IT IS ALL LIKE A DIM DREAM WHEN I LOOK
BACK ON IT I HAD BEEN DRINKING HARD OF LATE AND THE TWO THINGS
TOGETHER FAIRLY TURNED MY BRAIN THERES SOMETHING THROBBING IN MY
HEAD NOW LIKE A DOCKERS HAMMER BUT THAT MORNING I SEEMED TO HAVE
ALL NIAGARA WHIZZING AND BUZZING IN MY EARS
WELL I TOOK TO MY HEELS AND I RAN AFTER THE CAB I HAD A HEAVY
OAK STICK IN MY HAND AND I TELL YOU I SAW RED FROM THE FIRST BUT AS
I RAN I GOT CUNNING TOO AND HUNG BACK A LITTLE TO SEE THEM WITHOUT
BEING SEEN THEY PULLED UP SOON AT THE RAILWAY STATION THERE WAS A
GOOD CROWD ROUND THE BOOKINGOFFICE SO I GOT QUITE CLOSE TO THEM
WITHOUT BEING SEEN THEY TOOK TICKETS FOR NEW BRIGHTON SO DID I BUT
I GOT IN THREE CARRIAGES BEHIND THEM WHEN WE REACHED IT THEY WALKED
ALONG THE PARADE AND I WAS NEVER MORE THAN A HUNDRED YARDS FROM
THEM AT LAST I SAW THEM HIRE A BOAT AND START FOR A ROW FOR IT WAS
A VERY HOT DAY AND THEY THOUGHT NO DOUBT THAT IT WOULD BE COOLER
ON THE WATER
IT WAS JUST AS IF THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN INTO MY HANDS THERE WAS A
BIT OF A HAZE AND YOU COULD NOT SEE MORE THAN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS I
HIRED A BOAT FOR MYSELF AND I PULLED AFTER THEM I COULD SEE THE
BLUR OF THEIR CRAFT BUT THEY WERE GOING NEARLY AS FAST AS I AND
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN A LONG MILE FROM THE SHORE BEFORE I CAUGHT THEM
UP THE HAZE WAS LIKE A CURTAIN ALL ROUND US AND THERE WERE WE THREE
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT MY GOD SHALL I EVER FORGET THEIR FACES WHEN
THEY SAW WHO WAS IN THE BOAT THAT WAS CLOSING IN UPON THEM SHE
SCREAMED OUT HE SWORE LIKE A MADMAN AND JABBED AT ME WITH AN OAR
FOR HE MUST HAVE SEEN DEATH IN MY EYES I GOT PAST IT AND GOT ONE IN
WITH MY STICK THAT CRUSHED HIS HEAD LIKE AN EGG I WOULD HAVE SPARED
HER PERHAPS FOR ALL MY MADNESS BUT SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HIM
CRYING OUT TO HIM AND CALLING HIM ALEC I STRUCK AGAIN AND SHE
LAY STRETCHED BESIDE HIM I WAS LIKE A WILD BEAST THEN THAT HAD
TASTED BLOOD IF SARAH HAD BEEN THERE BY THE LORD SHE SHOULD HAVE
JOINED THEM I PULLED OUT MY KNIFE ANDWELL THERE IVE SAID
ENOUGH IT GAVE ME A KIND OF SAVAGE JOY WHEN I THOUGHT HOW SARAH
WOULD FEEL WHEN SHE HAD SUCH SIGNS AS THESE OF WHAT HER MEDDLING HAD
BROUGHT ABOUT THEN I TIED THE BODIES INTO THE BOAT STOVE A PLANK
AND STOOD BY UNTIL THEY HAD SUNK I KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE OWNER
WOULD THINK THAT THEY HAD LOST THEIR BEARINGS IN THE HAZE AND HAD
DRIFTED OFF OUT TO SEA I CLEANED MYSELF UP GOT BACK TO LAND AND
JOINED MY SHIP WITHOUT A SOUL HAVING A SUSPICION OF WHAT HAD PASSED
THAT NIGHT I MADE UP THE PACKET FOR SARAH CUSHING AND NEXT DAY I
SENT IT FROM BELFAST
THERE YOU HAVE THE WHOLE TRUTH OF IT YOU CAN HANG ME OR DO WHAT
YOU LIKE WITH ME BUT YOU CANNOT PUNISH ME AS I HAVE BEEN PUNISHED
ALREADY I CANNOT SHUT MY EYES BUT I SEE THOSE TWO FACES STARING AT
MESTARING AT ME AS THEY STARED WHEN MY BOAT BROKE THROUGH THE HAZE
I KILLED THEM QUICK BUT THEY ARE KILLING ME SLOW AND IF I HAVE
ANOTHER NIGHT OF IT I SHALL BE EITHER MAD OR DEAD BEFORE MORNING YOU
WONT PUT ME ALONE INTO A CELL SIR FOR PITYS SAKE DONT AND MAY
YOU BE TREATED IN YOUR DAY OF AGONY AS YOU TREAT ME NOW
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF IT WATSON SAID HOLMES SOLEMNLY AS HE LAID
DOWN THE PAPER WHAT OBJECT IS SERVED BY THIS CIRCLE OF MISERY AND
VIOLENCE AND FEAR IT MUST TEND TO SOME END OR ELSE OUR UNIVERSE IS
RULED BY CHANCE WHICH IS UNTHINKABLE BUT WHAT END THERE IS THE
GREAT STANDING PERENNIAL PROBLEM TO WHICH HUMAN REASON IS AS FAR FROM
AN ANSWER AS EVER
THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE
TABLE OF CONTENTS
PART ONE
PART TWO
CHAPTER I
PART ONE
WELL MRS WARREN I CANNOT SEE THAT YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR CAUSE
FOR UNEASINESS NOR DO I UNDERSTAND WHY I WHOSE TIME IS OF SOME
VALUE SHOULD INTERFERE IN THE MATTER I REALLY HAVE OTHER THINGS TO
ENGAGE ME SO SPOKE SHERLOCK HOLMES AND TURNED BACK TO THE GREAT
SCRAPBOOK IN WHICH HE WAS ARRANGING AND INDEXING SOME OF HIS RECENT
MATERIAL
BUT THE LANDLADY HAD THE PERTINACITY AND ALSO THE CUNNING OF HER SEX
SHE HELD HER GROUND FIRMLY
YOU ARRANGED AN AFFAIR FOR A LODGER OF MINE LAST YEAR SHE
SAIDMR FAIRDALE HOBBS
AH YESA SIMPLE MATTER
BUT HE WOULD NEVER CEASE TALKING OF ITYOUR KINDNESS SIR AND THE
WAY IN WHICH YOU BROUGHT LIGHT INTO THE DARKNESS I REMEMBERED HIS
WORDS WHEN I WAS IN DOUBT AND DARKNESS MYSELF I KNOW YOU COULD IF
YOU ONLY WOULD
HOLMES WAS ACCESSIBLE UPON THE SIDE OF FLATTERY AND ALSO TO DO HIM
JUSTICE UPON THE SIDE OF KINDLINESS THE TWO FORCES MADE HIM LAY
DOWN HIS GUMBRUSH WITH A SIGH OF RESIGNATION AND PUSH BACK HIS
CHAIR
WELL WELL MRS WARREN LET US HEAR ABOUT IT THEN YOU DONT
OBJECT TO TOBACCO I TAKE IT THANK YOU WATSONTHE MATCHES YOU ARE
UNEASY AS I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE YOUR NEW LODGER REMAINS IN HIS ROOMS
AND YOU CANNOT SEE HIM WHY BLESS YOU MRS WARREN IF I WERE YOUR
LODGER YOU OFTEN WOULD NOT SEE ME FOR WEEKS ON END
NO DOUBT SIR BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT IT FRIGHTENS ME MR HOLMES I
CANT SLEEP FOR FRIGHT TO HEAR HIS QUICK STEP MOVING HERE AND MOVING
THERE FROM EARLY MORNING TO LATE AT NIGHT AND YET NEVER TO CATCH SO
MUCH AS A GLIMPSE OF HIMITS MORE THAN I CAN STAND MY HUSBAND IS
AS NERVOUS OVER IT AS I AM BUT HE IS OUT AT HIS WORK ALL DAY WHILE
I GET NO REST FROM IT WHAT IS HE HIDING FOR WHAT HAS HE DONE
EXCEPT FOR THE GIRL I AM ALL ALONE IN THE HOUSE WITH HIM AND ITS
MORE THAN MY NERVES CAN STAND
HOLMES LEANED FORWARD AND LAID HIS LONG THIN FINGERS UPON THE
WOMANS SHOULDER HE HAD AN ALMOST HYPNOTIC POWER OF SOOTHING WHEN HE
WISHED THE SCARED LOOK FADED FROM HER EYES AND HER AGITATED
FEATURES SMOOTHED INTO THEIR USUAL COMMONPLACE SHE SAT DOWN IN THE
CHAIR WHICH HE HAD INDICATED
IF I TAKE IT UP I MUST UNDERSTAND EVERY DETAIL SAID HE TAKE TIME
TO CONSIDER THE SMALLEST POINT MAY BE THE MOST ESSENTIAL YOU SAY
THAT THE MAN CAME TEN DAYS AGO AND PAID YOU FOR A FORTNIGHTS BOARD
AND LODGING
HE ASKED MY TERMS SIR I SAID FIFTY SHILLINGS A WEEK THERE IS A
SMALL SITTINGROOM AND BEDROOM AND ALL COMPLETE AT THE TOP OF THE
HOUSE
WELL
HE SAID ILL PAY YOU FIVE POUNDS A WEEK IF I CAN HAVE IT ON MY OWN
TERMS IM A POOR WOMAN SIR AND MR WARREN EARNS LITTLE AND THE
MONEY MEANT MUCH TO ME HE TOOK OUT A TENPOUND NOTE AND HE HELD IT
OUT TO ME THEN AND THERE YOU CAN HAVE THE SAME EVERY FORTNIGHT FOR
A LONG TIME TO COME IF YOU KEEP THE TERMS HE SAID IF NOT ILL
HAVE NO MORE TO DO WITH YOU
WHAT WERE THE TERMS
WELL SIR THEY WERE THAT HE WAS TO HAVE A KEY OF THE HOUSE THAT
WAS ALL RIGHT LODGERS OFTEN HAVE THEM ALSO THAT HE WAS TO BE LEFT
ENTIRELY TO HIMSELF AND NEVER UPON ANY EXCUSE TO BE DISTURBED
NOTHING WONDERFUL IN THAT SURELY
NOT IN REASON SIR BUT THIS IS OUT OF ALL REASON HE HAS BEEN THERE
FOR TEN DAYS AND NEITHER MR WARREN NOR I NOR THE GIRL HAS ONCE
SET EYES UPON HIM WE CAN HEAR THAT QUICK STEP OF HIS PACING UP AND
DOWN UP AND DOWN NIGHT MORNING AND NOON BUT EXCEPT ON THAT FIRST
NIGHT HE HAD NEVER ONCE GONE OUT OF THE HOUSE
OH HE WENT OUT THE FIRST NIGHT DID HE
YES SIR AND RETURNED VERY LATEAFTER WE WERE ALL IN BED HE TOLD
ME AFTER HE HAD TAKEN THE ROOMS THAT HE WOULD DO SO AND ASKED ME NOT
TO BAR THE DOOR I HEARD HIM COME UP THE STAIR AFTER MIDNIGHT
BUT HIS MEALS
IT WAS HIS PARTICULAR DIRECTION THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS WHEN HE RANG
LEAVE HIS MEAL UPON A CHAIR OUTSIDE HIS DOOR THEN HE RINGS AGAIN
WHEN HE HAS FINISHED AND WE TAKE IT DOWN FROM THE SAME CHAIR IF HE
WANTS ANYTHING ELSE HE PRINTS IT ON A SLIP OF PAPER AND LEAVES IT
PRINTS IT
YES SIR PRINTS IT IN PENCIL JUST THE WORD NOTHING MORE HERES
THE ONE I BROUGHT TO SHOW YOUSOAP HERES ANOTHERMATCH THIS IS
ONE HE LEFT THE FIRST MORNINGDAILY GAZETTE I LEAVE THAT PAPER WITH
HIS BREAKFAST EVERY MORNING
DEAR ME WATSON SAID HOMES STARING WITH GREAT CURIOSITY AT THE
SLIPS OF FOOLSCAP WHICH THE LANDLADY HAD HANDED TO HIM THIS IS
CERTAINLY A LITTLE UNUSUAL SECLUSION I CAN UNDERSTAND BUT WHY
PRINT PRINTING IS A CLUMSY PROCESS WHY NOT WRITE WHAT WOULD IT
SUGGEST WATSON
THAT HE DESIRED TO CONCEAL HIS HANDWRITING
BUT WHY WHAT CAN IT MATTER TO HIM THAT HIS LANDLADY SHOULD HAVE A
WORD OF HIS WRITING STILL IT MAY BE AS YOU SAY THEN AGAIN WHY
SUCH LACONIC MESSAGES
I CANNOT IMAGINE
IT OPENS A PLEASING FIELD FOR INTELLIGENT SPECULATION THE WORDS ARE
WRITTEN WITH A BROADPOINTED VIOLETTINTED PENCIL OF A NOT UNUSUAL
PATTERN YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT THE PAPER IS TORN AWAY AT THE SIDE
HERE AFTER THE PRINTING WAS DONE SO THAT THE S OF SOAP IS PARTLY
GONE SUGGESTIVE WATSON IS IT NOT
OF CAUTION
EXACTLY THERE WAS EVIDENTLY SOME MARK SOME THUMBPRINT SOMETHING
WHICH MIGHT GIVE A CLUE TO THE PERSONS IDENTITY NOW MRS WARREN
YOU SAY THAT THE MAN WAS OF MIDDLE SIZE DARK AND BEARDED WHAT AGE
WOULD HE BE
YOUNGISH SIRNOT OVER THIRTY
WELL CAN YOU GIVE ME NO FURTHER INDICATIONS
HE SPOKE GOOD ENGLISH SIR AND YET I THOUGHT HE WAS A FOREIGNER BY
HIS ACCENT
AND HE WAS WELL DRESSED
VERY SMARTLY DRESSED SIRQUITE THE GENTLEMAN DARK
CLOTHESNOTHING YOU WOULD NOTE
HE GAVE NO NAME
NO SIR
AND HAS HAD NO LETTERS OR CALLERS
NONE
BUT SURELY YOU OR THE GIRL ENTER HIS ROOM OF A MORNING
NO SIR HE LOOKS AFTER HIMSELF ENTIRELY
DEAR ME THAT IS CERTAINLY REMARKABLE WHAT ABOUT HIS LUGGAGE
HE HAD ONE BIG BROWN BAG WITH HIMNOTHING ELSE
WELL WE DONT SEEM TO HAVE MUCH MATERIAL TO HELP US DO YOU SAY
NOTHING HAS COME OUT OF THAT ROOMABSOLUTELY NOTHING
THE LANDLADY DREW AN ENVELOPE FROM HER BAG FROM IT SHE SHOOK OUT TWO
BURNT MATCHES AND A CIGARETTEEND UPON THE TABLE
THEY WERE ON HIS TRAY THIS MORNING I BROUGHT THEM BECAUSE I HAD
HEARD THAT YOU CAN READ GREAT THINGS OUT OF SMALL ONES
HOLMES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
THERE IS NOTHING HERE SAID HE THE MATCHES HAVE OF COURSE BEEN
USED TO LIGHT CIGARETTES THAT IS OBVIOUS FROM THE SHORTNESS OF THE
BURNT END HALF THE MATCH IS CONSUMED IN LIGHTING A PIPE OR CIGAR
BUT DEAR ME THIS CIGARETTE STUB IS CERTAINLY REMARKABLE THE
GENTLEMAN WAS BEARDED AND MOUSTACHED YOU SAY
YES SIR
I DONT UNDERSTAND THAT I SHOULD SAY THAT ONLY A CLEANSHAVEN MAN
COULD HAVE SMOKED THIS WHY WATSON EVEN YOUR MODEST MOUSTACHE WOULD
HAVE BEEN SINGED
A HOLDER I SUGGESTED
NO NO THE END IS MATTED I SUPPOSE THERE COULD NOT BE TWO PEOPLE
IN YOUR ROOMS MRS WARREN
NO SIR HE EATS SO LITTLE THAT I OFTEN WONDER IT CAN KEEP LIFE IN
ONE
WELL I THINK WE MUST WAIT FOR A LITTLE MORE MATERIAL AFTER ALL
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF YOU HAVE RECEIVED YOUR RENT AND HE
IS NOT A TROUBLESOME LODGER THOUGH HE IS CERTAINLY AN UNUSUAL ONE
HE PAYS YOU WELL AND IF HE CHOOSES TO LIE CONCEALED IT IS NO DIRECT
BUSINESS OF YOURS WE HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR AN INTRUSION UPON HIS
PRIVACY UNTIL WE HAVE SOME REASON TO THINK THAT THERE IS A GUILTY
REASON FOR IT IVE TAKEN UP THE MATTER AND I WONT LOSE SIGHT OF
IT REPORT TO ME IF ANYTHING FRESH OCCURS AND RELY UPON MY
ASSISTANCE IF IT SHOULD BE NEEDED
THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME POINTS OF INTEREST IN THIS CASE WATSON
HE REMARKED WHEN THE LANDLADY HAD LEFT US IT MAY OF COURSE BE
TRIVIALINDIVIDUAL ECCENTRICITY OR IT MAY BE VERY MUCH DEEPER THAN
APPEARS ON THE SURFACE THE FIRST THING THAT STRIKE ONE IS THE
OBVIOUS POSSIBILITY THAT THE PERSON NOW IN THE ROOMS MAY BE ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE WHO ENGAGED THEM
WHY SHOULD YOU THINK SO
WELL APART FORM THIS CIGARETTEEND WAS IT NOT SUGGESTIVE THAT THE
ONLY TIME THE LODGER WENT OUT WAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS TAKING THE
ROOMS HE CAME BACKOR SOMEONE CAME BACKWHEN ALL WITNESSES WERE
OUT OF THE WAY WE HAVE NO PROOF THAT THE PERSON WHO CAME BACK WAS
THE PERSON WHO WENT OUT THEN AGAIN THE MAN WHO TOOK THE ROOMS
SPOKE ENGLISH WELL THIS OTHER HOWEVER PRINTS MATCH WHEN IT
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MATCHES I CAN IMAGINE THAT THE WORD WAS TAKEN OUT
OF A DICTIONARY WHICH WOULD GIVE THE NOUN BUT NOT THE PLURAL THE
LACONIC STYLE MAY BE TO CONCEAL THE ABSENCE OF KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH
YES WATSON THERE ARE GOOD REASONS TO SUSPECT THAT THERE HAS BEEN A
SUBSTITUTION OF LODGERS
BUT FOR WHAT POSSIBLE END
AH THERE LIES OUR PROBLEM THERE IS ONE RATHER OBVIOUS LINE OF
INVESTIGATION HE TOOK DOWN THE GREAT BOOK IN WHICH DAY BY DAY HE
FILED THE AGONY COLUMNS OF THE VARIOUS LONDON JOURNALS DEAR ME
SAID HE TURNING OVER THE PAGES WHAT A CHORUS OF GROANS CRIES AND
BLEATINGS WHAT A RAGBAG OF SINGULAR HAPPENINGS BUT SURELY THE MOST
VALUABLE HUNTINGGROUND THAT EVER WAS GIVEN TO A STUDENT OF THE
UNUSUAL THIS PERSON IS ALONE AND CANNOT BE APPROACHED BY LETTER
WITHOUT A BREACH OF THAT ABSOLUTE SECRECY WHICH IS DESIRED HOW IS
ANY NEWS OR ANY MESSAGE TO REACH HIM FROM WITHOUT OBVIOUSLY BY
ADVERTISEMENT THROUGH A NEWSPAPER THERE SEEMS NO OTHER WAY AND
FORTUNATELY WE NEED CONCERN OURSELVES WITH THE ONE PAPER ONLY HERE
ARE THE DAILY GAZETTE EXTRACTS OF THE LAST FORTNIGHT LADY WITH A
BLACK BOA AT PRINCES SKATING CLUBTHAT WE MAY PASS SURELY JIMMY
WILL NOT BREAK HIS MOTHERS HEARTTHAT APPEARS TO BE IRRELEVANT
IF THE LADY WHO FAINTED ON BRIXTON BUSSHE DOES NOT INTEREST ME
EVERY DAY MY HEART LONGS BLEAT WATSONUNMITIGATED BLEAT AH
THIS IS A LITTLE MORE POSSIBLE LISTEN TO THIS BE PATIENT WILL
FIND SOME SURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATIONS MEANWHILE THIS COLUMN G
THAT IS TWO DAYS AFTER MRS WARRENS LODGER ARRIVED IT SOUNDS
PLAUSIBLE DOES IT NOT THE MYSTERIOUS ONE COULD UNDERSTAND ENGLISH
EVEN IF HE COULD NOT PRINT IT LET US SEE IF WE CAN PICK UP THE TRACE
AGAIN YES HERE WE ARETHREE DAYS LATER AM MAKING SUCCESSFUL
ARRANGEMENTS PATIENCE AND PRUDENCE THE CLOUDS WILL PASS G
NOTHING FOR A WEEK AFTER THAT THEN COMES SOMETHING MUCH MORE
DEFINITE THE PATH IS CLEARING IF I FIND CHANCE SIGNAL MESSAGE
REMEMBER CODE AGREEDONE A TWO B AND SO ON YOU WILL HEAR SOON
G THAT WAS IN YESTERDAYS PAPER AND THERE IS NOTHING IN TODAYS
ITS ALL VERY APPROPRIATE TO MRS WARRENS LODGER IF WE WAIT A
LITTLE WATSON I DONT DOUBT THAT THE AFFAIR WILL GROW MORE
INTELLIGIBLE
SO IT PROVED FOR IN THE MORNING I FOUND MY FRIEND STANDING ON THE
HEARTHRUG WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE AND A SMILE OF COMPLETE
SATISFACTION UPON HIS FACE
HOWS THIS WATSON HE CRIED PICKING UP THE PAPER FROM THE TABLE
HIGH RED HOUSE WITH WHITE STONE FACINGS THIRD FLOOR SECOND WINDOW
LEFT AFTER DUSK G THAT IS DEFINITE ENOUGH I THINK AFTER
BREAKFAST WE MUST MAKE A LITTLE RECONNAISSANCE OF MRS WARRENS
NEIGHBOURHOOD AH MRS WARREN WHAT NEWS DO YOU BRING US THIS
MORNING
OUR CLIENT HAD SUDDENLY BURST INTO THE ROOM WITH AN EXPLOSIVE ENERGY
WHICH TOLD OF SOME NEW AND MOMENTOUS DEVELOPMENT
ITS A POLICE MATTER MR HOLMES SHE CRIED ILL HAVE NO MORE OF
IT HE SHALL PACK OUT OF THERE WITH HIS BAGGAGE I WOULD HAVE GONE
STRAIGHT UP AND TOLD HIM SO ONLY I THOUGHT IT WAS BUT FAIR TO YOU TO
TAKE YOUR OPINION FIRST BUT IM AT THE END OF MY PATIENCE AND WHEN
IT COMES TO KNOCKING MY OLD MAN ABOUT
KNOCKING MR WARREN ABOUT
USING HIM ROUGHLY ANYWAY
BUT WHO USED HIM ROUGHLY
AH THATS WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IT WAS THIS MORNING SIR MR
WARREN IS A TIMEKEEPER AT MORTON AND WAYLIGHTS IN TOTTENHAM COURT
ROAD HE HAS TO BE OUT OF THE HOUSE BEFORE SEVEN WELL THIS MORNING
HE HAD NOT GONE TEN PACES DOWN THE ROAD WHEN TWO MEN CAME UP BEHIND
HIM THREW A COAT OVER HIS HEAD AND BUNDLED HIM INTO A CAB THAT WAS
BESIDE THE CURB THEY DROVE HIM AN HOUR AND THEN OPENED THE DOOR AND
SHOT HIM OUT HE LAY IN THE ROADWAY SO SHAKEN IN HIS WITS THAT HE
NEVER SAW WHAT BECAME OF THE CAB WHEN HE PICKED HIMSELF UP HE FOUND
HE WAS ON HAMPSTEAD HEATH SO HE TOOK A BUS HOME AND THERE HE LIES
NOW ON HIS SOFA WHILE I CAME STRAIGHT ROUND TO TELL YOU WHAT HAD
HAPPENED
MOST INTERESTING SAID HOLMES DID HE OBSERVE THE APPEARANCE OF
THESE MENDID HE HEAR THEM TALK
NO HE IS CLEAN DAZED HE JUST KNOWS THAT HE WAS LIFTED UP AS IF BY
MAGIC AND DROPPED AS IF BY MAGIC TWO A LEAST WERE IN IT AND MAYBE
THREE
AND YOU CONNECT THIS ATTACK WITH YOUR LODGER
WELL WEVE LIVED THERE FIFTEEN YEARS AND NO SUCH HAPPENINGS EVER
CAME BEFORE IVE HAD ENOUGH OF HIM MONEYS NOT EVERYTHING ILL

WAIT A BIT MRS WARREN DO NOTHING RASH I BEGIN TO THINK THAT THIS
AFFAIR MAY BE VERY MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN APPEARED AT FIRST SIGHT
IT IS CLEAR NOW THAT SOME DANGER IS THREATENING YOUR LODGER IT IS
EQUALLY CLEAR THAT HIS ENEMIES LYING IN WAIT FOR HIM NEAR YOUR DOOR
MISTOOK YOUR HUSBAND FOR HIM IN THE FOGGY MORNING LIGHT ON
DISCOVERING THEIR MISTAKE THEY RELEASED HIM WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE
DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN A MISTAKE WE CAN ONLY CONJECTURE
WELL WHAT AM I TO DO MR HOLMES

I ALWAYS HEAR HIM UNLOCK IT AS I GO DOWN THE STAIR AFTER I LEAVE THE
TRAY
HE HAS TO TAKE THE TRAY IN SURELY WE COULD CONCEAL OURSELVES AND
SEE HIM DO IT
THE LANDLADY THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT

LOOKINGGLASS MAYBE AND IF YOU WERE BEHIND THE DOOR

I HAVE IT ALL READY FOR YOU IF YOU WILL BOTH COME UP AND LEAVE YOUR
BOOTS BELOW ON THE LANDING ILL PUT YOU THERE NOW
IT WAS AN EXCELLENT HIDINGPLACE WHICH SHE HAD ARRANGED THE MIRROR
WAS SO PLACED THAT SEATED IN THE DARK WE COULD VERY PLAINLY SEE THE
DOOR OPPOSITE WE HAD HARDLY SETTLED DOWN IN IT AND MRS WARREN LEFT
US WHEN A DISTANT TINKLE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR MYSTERIOUS NEIGHBOUR HAD
RUNG PRESENTLY THE LANDLADY APPEARED WITH THE TRAY LAID IT DOWN
UPON A CHAIR BESIDE THE CLOSED DOOR AND THEN TREADING HEAVILY
DEPARTED CROUCHING TOGETHER IN THE ANGLE OF THE DOOR WE KEPT OUR
EYES FIXED UPON THE MIRROR SUDDENLY AS THE LANDLADYS FOOTSTEPS
DIED AWAY THERE WAS THE CREAK OF A TURNING KEY THE HANDLE REVOLVED
AND TWO THIN HANDS DARTED OUT AND LIFTED THE TRAY FORM THE CHAIR AN
INSTANT LATER IT WAS HURRIEDLY REPLACED AND I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A
DARK BEAUTIFUL HORRIFIED FACE GLARING AT THE NARROW OPENING OF THE
BOXROOM THEN THE DOOR CRASHED TO THE KEY TURNED ONCE MORE AND ALL
WAS SILENCE HOLMES TWITCHED MY SLEEVE AND TOGETHER WE STOLE DOWN
THE STAIR
I WILL CALL AGAIN IN THE EVENING SAID HE TO THE EXPECTANT
LANDLADY I THINK WATSON WE CAN DISCUSS THIS BUSINESS BETTER IN
OUR OWN QUARTERS
MY SURMISE AS YOU SAW PROVED TO BE CORRECT SAID HE SPEAKING
FROM THE DEPTHS OF HIS EASYCHAIR THERE HAS BEEN A SUBSTITUTION OF
LODGERS WHAT I DID NOT FORESEE IS THAT WE SHOULD FIND A WOMAN AND
NO ORDINARY WOMAN WATSON
SHE SAW US
WELL SHE SAW SOMETHING TO ALARM HER THAT IS CERTAIN THE GENERAL
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS IS PRETTY CLEAR IS IT NOT A COUPLE SEEK REFUGE
IN LONDON FROM A VERY TERRIBLE AND INSTANT DANGER THE MEASURE OF
THAT DANGER IS THE RIGOUR OF THEIR PRECAUTIONS THE MAN WHO HAS SOME
WORK WHICH HE MUST DO DESIRES TO LEAVE THE WOMAN IN ABSOLUTE SAFETY
WHILE HE DOES IT IT IS NOT AN EASY PROBLEM BUT HE SOLVED IT IN AN
ORIGINAL FASHION AND SO EFFECTIVELY THAT HER PRESENCE WAS NOT EVEN
KNOWN TO THE LANDLADY WHO SUPPLIES HER WITH FOOD THE PRINTED
MESSAGES AS IS NOW EVIDENT WERE TO PREVENT HER SEX BEING DISCOVERED
BY HER WRITING THE MAN CANNOT COME NEAR THE WOMAN OR HE WILL GUIDE
THEIR ENEMIES TO HER SINCE HE CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITH HER DIRECT HE
HAS RECOURSE TO THE AGONY COLUMN OF A PAPER SO FAR ALL IS CLEAR
BUT WHAT IS AT THE ROOT OF IT
AH YES WATSONSEVERELY PRACTICAL AS USUAL WHAT IS AT THE ROOT
OF IT ALL MRS WARRENS WHIMSICAL PROBLEM ENLARGES SOMEWHAT AND
ASSUMES A MORE SINISTER ASPECT AS WE PROCEED THIS MUCH WE CAN SAY
THAT IT IS NO ORDINARY LOVE ESCAPADE YOU SAW THE WOMANS FACE AT THE
SIGN OF DANGER WE HAVE HEARD TOO OF THE ATTACK UPON THE LANDLORD
WHICH WAS UNDOUBTEDLY MEANT FOR THE LODGER THESE ALARMS AND THE
DESPERATE NEED FOR SECRECY ARGUE THAT THE MATTER IS ONE OF LIFE OR
DEATH THE ATTACK UPON MR WARREN FURTHER SHOWS THAT THE ENEMY
WHOEVER THEY ARE ARE THEMSELVES NOT AWARE OF THE SUBSTITUTION OF THE
FEMALE LODGER FOR THE MALE IT IS VERY CURIOUS AND COMPLEX WATSON
WHY SHOULD YOU GO FURTHER IN IT WHAT HAVE YOU TO GAIN FROM IT
WHAT INDEED IT IS ART FOR ARTS SAKE WATSON I SUPPOSE WHEN YOU
DOCTORED YOU FOUND YOURSELF STUDYING CASES WITHOUT THOUGHT OF A FEE
FOR MY EDUCATION HOLMES
EDUCATION NEVER ENDS WATSON IT IS A SERIES OF LESSONS WITH THE
GREATEST FOR THE LAST THIS IS AN INSTRUCTIVE CASE THERE IS NEITHER
MONEY NOR CREDIT IN IT AND YET ONE WOULD WISH TO TIDY IT UP WHEN
DUSK COMES WE SHOULD FIND OURSELVES ONE STAGE ADVANCED IN OUR
INVESTIGATION
WHEN WE RETURNED TO MRS WARRENS ROOMS THE GLOOM OF A LONDON WINTER
EVENING HAD THICKENED INTO ONE GRAY CURTAIN A DEAD MONOTONE OF
COLOUR BROKEN ONLY BY THE SHARP YELLOW SQUARES OF THE WINDOWS AND
THE BLURRED HALOES OF THE GASLAMPS AS WE PEERED FROM THE DARKENED
SITTINGROOM OF THE LODGINGHOUSE ONE MORE DIM LIGHT GLIMMERED HIGH
UP THROUGH THE OBSCURITY

OBSCURE CIPHER WATSON SAID HE WHY OF COURSE IT IS ITALIAN THE
A MEANS THAT IT IS ADDRESSED TO A WOMAN BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE
HOWS THAT WATSON
I BELIEVE YOU HAVE HIT IT
NOT A DOUBT OF IT IT IS A VERY URGENT MESSAGE THRICE REPEATED TO
MAKE IT MORE SO BUT BEWARE OF WHAT WAIT A BIT HE IS COMING TO THE
WINDOW ONCE MORE

THE SMALL FLAME ACROSS THE WINDOW AS THE SIGNALS WERE RENEWED THEY
CAME MORE RAPIDLY THAN BEFORESO RAPID THAT IT WAS HARD TO FOLLOW
THEM
PERICOLOPERICOLOEH WHATS THAT WATSON DANGER ISNT IT
YES BY JOVE ITS A DANGER SIGNAL THERE HE GOES AGAIN PERI
HALLOA WHAT ON EARTH

DISAPPEARED AND THE THIRD FLOOR FORMED A DARK BAND ROUND THE LOFTY
BUILDING WITH ITS TIERS OF SHINING CASEMENTS THAT LAST WARNING CRY
HAD BEEN SUDDENLY CUT SHORT HOW AND BY WHOM THE SAME THOUGHT
OCCURRED ON THE INSTANT TO US BOTH HOLMES SPRANG UP FROM WHERE HE
CROUCHED BY THE WINDOW
THIS IS SERIOUS WATSON HE CRIED THERE IS SOME DEVILRY GOING
FORWARD WHY SHOULD SUCH A MESSAGE STOP IN SUCH A WAY I SHOULD PUT
SCOTLAND YARD IN TOUCH WITH THIS BUSINESSAND YET IT IS TOO
PRESSING FOR US TO LEAVE

WE MUST DEFINE THE SITUATION A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY IT MAY BEAR SOME
MORE INNOCENT INTERPRETATION COME WATSON LET US GO ACROSS
OURSELVES AND SEE WHAT WE CAN MAKE OF IT
CHAPTER II
PART TWO
AS WE WALKED RAPIDLY DOWN HOWE STREET I GLANCED BACK AT THE BUILDING
WHICH WE HAD LEFT THERE DIMLY OUTLINED AT THE TOP WINDOW I COULD
SEE THE SHADOW OF A HEAD A WOMANS HEAD GAZING TENSELY RIGIDLY
OUT INTO THE NIGHT WAITING WITH BREATHLESS SUSPENSE FOR THE RENEWAL
OF THAT INTERRUPTED MESSAGE AT THE DOORWAY OF THE HOWE STREET FLATS
A MAN MUFFLED IN A CRAVAT AND GREATCOAT WAS LEANING AGAINST THE
RAILING HE STARTED AS THE HALLLIGHT FELL UPON OUR FACES
HOLMES HE CRIED
WHY GREGSON SAID MY COMPANION AS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH THE SCOTLAND
YARD DETECTIVE JOURNEYS END WITH LOVERS MEETINGS WHAT BRINGS YOU
HERE
THE SAME REASONS THAT BRING YOU I EXPECT SAID GREGSON HOW YOU
GOT ON TO IT I CANT IMAGINE
DIFFERENT THREADS BUT LEADING UP TO THE SAME TANGLE IVE BEEN
TAKING THE SIGNALS
SIGNALS
YES FROM THAT WINDOW THEY BROKE OFF IN THE MIDDLE WE CAME OVER TO
SEE THE REASON BUT SINCE IT IS SAFE IN YOUR HANDS I SEE NO OBJECT IN
CONTINUING THIS BUSINESS
WAIT A BIT CRIED GREGSON EAGERLY ILL DO YOU THIS JUSTICE MR
HOLMES THAT I WAS NEVER IN A CASE YET THAT I DIDNT FEEL STRONGER
FOR HAVING YOU ON MY SIDE THERES ONLY THE ONE EXIT TO THESE FLATS
SO WE HAVE HIM SAFE
WHO IS HE
WELL WELL WE SCORE OVER YOU FOR ONCE MR HOLMES YOU MUST GIVE US
BEST THIS TIME HE STRUCK HIS STICK SHARPLY UPON THE GROUND ON
WHICH A CABMAN HIS WHIP IN HIS HAND SAUNTERED OVER FROM A
FOURWHEELER WHICH STOOD ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE STREET MAY I
INTRODUCE YOU TO MR SHERLOCK HOLMES HE SAID TO THE CABMAN THIS
IS MR LEVERTON OF PINKERTONS AMERICAN AGENCY
THE HERO OF THE LONG ISLAND CAVE MYSTERY SAID HOLMES SIR I AM
PLEASED TO MEET YOU
THE AMERICAN A QUIET BUSINESSLIKE YOUNG MAN WITH A CLEANSHAVEN
HATCHET FACE FLUSHED UP AT THE WORDS OF COMMENDATION I AM ON THE
TRAIL OF MY LIFE NOW MR HOLMES SAID HE IF I CAN GET GORGIANO
WHAT GORGIANO OF THE RED CIRCLE
OH HE HAS A EUROPEAN FAME HAS HE WELL WEVE LEARNED ALL ABOUT
HIM IN AMERICA WE KNOW HE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF FIFTY MURDERS AND YET
WE HAVE NOTHING POSITIVE WE CAN TAKE HIM ON I TRACKED HIM OVER FROM
NEW YORK AND IVE BEEN CLOSE TO HIM FOR A WEEK IN LONDON WAITING
SOME EXCUSE TO GET MY HAND ON HIS COLLAR MR GREGSON AND I RAN HIM
TO GROUND IN THAT BIG TENEMENT HOUSE AND THERES ONLY ONE DOOR SO
HE CANT SLIP US THERES THREE FOLK COME OUT SINCE HE WENT IN BUT
ILL SWEAR HE WASNT ONE OF THEM
MR HOLMES TALKS OF SIGNALS SAID GREGSON I EXPECT AS USUAL HE
KNOWS A GOOD DEAL THAT WE DONT
IN A FEW CLEAR WORDS HOLMES EXPLAINED THE SITUATION AS IT HAD
APPEARED TO US THE AMERICAN STRUCK HIS HANDS TOGETHER WITH VEXATION
HES ON TO US HE CRIED
WHY DO YOU THINK SO
WELL IT FIGURES OUT THAT WAY DOES IT NOT HERE HE IS SENDING OUT
MESSAGES TO AN ACCOMPLICETHERE ARE SEVERAL OF HIS GANG IN LONDON
THEN SUDDENLY JUST AS BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT HE WAS TELLING THEM THAT
THERE WAS DANGER HE BROKE SHORT OFF WHAT COULD IT MEAN EXCEPT THAT
FROM THE WINDOW HE HAD SUDDENLY EITHER CAUGHT SIGHT OF US IN THE
STREET OR IN SOME WAY COME TO UNDERSTAND HOW CLOSE THE DANGER WAS
AND THAT HE MUST ACT RIGHT AWAY IF HE WAS TO AVOID IT WHAT DO YOU
SUGGEST MR HOLMES
THAT WE GO UP AT ONCE AND SEE FOR OURSELVES
BUT WE HAVE NO WARRANT FOR HIS ARREST
HE IS IN UNOCCUPIED PREMISES UNDER SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES SAID
GREGSON THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE MOMENT WHEN WE HAVE HIM BY THE
HEELS WE CAN SEE IF NEW YORK CANT HELP US TO KEEP HIM ILL TAKE THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF ARRESTING HIM NOW
OUR OFFICIAL DETECTIVES MAY BLUNDER IN THE MATTER OF INTELLIGENCE
BUT NEVER IN THAT OF COURAGE GREGSON CLIMBED THE STAIR TO ARREST
THIS DESPERATE MURDERER WITH THE SAME ABSOLUTELY QUIET AND
BUSINESSLIKE BEARING WITH WHICH HE WOULD HAVE ASCENDED THE OFFICIAL
STAIRCASE OF SCOTLAND YARD THE PINKERTON MAN HAD TRIED TO PUSH PAST
HIM BUT GREGSON HAD FIRMLY ELBOWED HIM BACK LONDON DANGERS WERE THE
PRIVILEGE OF THE LONDON FORCE
THE DOOR OF THE LEFTHAND FLAT UPON THE THIRD LANDING WAS STANDING
AJAR GREGSON PUSHED IT OPEN WITHIN ALL WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE AND
DARKNESS I STRUCK A MATCH AND LIT THE DETECTIVES LANTERN AS I DID
SO AND AS THE FLICKER STEADIED INTO A FLAME WE ALL GAVE A GASP OF
SURPRISE ON THE DEAL BOARDS OF THE CARPETLESS FLOOR THERE WAS
OUTLINED A FRESH TRACK OF BLOOD THE RED STEPS POINTED TOWARDS US AND
LED AWAY FROM AN INNER ROOM THE DOOR OF WHICH WAS CLOSED GREGSON
FLUNG IT OPEN AND HELD HIS LIGHT FULL BLAZE IN FRONT OF HIM WHILE WE
ALL PEERED EAGERLY OVER HIS SHOULDERS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR OF THE EMPTY ROOM WAS HUDDLED THE FIGURE
OF AN ENORMOUS MAN HIS CLEANSHAVEN SWARTHY FACE GROTESQUELY
HORRIBLE IN ITS CONTORTION AND HIS HEAD ENCIRCLED BY A GHASTLY
CRIMSON HALO OF BLOOD LYING IN A BROAD WET CIRCLE UPON THE WHITE
WOODWORK HIS KNEES WERE DRAWN UP HIS HANDS THROWN OUT IN AGONY AND
FROM THE CENTRE OF HIS BROAD BROWN UPTURNED THROAT THERE PROJECTED
THE WHITE HAFT OF A KNIFE DRIVEN BLADEDEEP INTO HIS BODY GIANT AS
HE WAS THE MAN MUST HAVE GONE DOWN LIKE A POLEAXED OX BEFORE THAT
TERRIFIC BLOW BESIDE HIS RIGHT HAND A MOST FORMIDABLE HORNHANDLED
TWOEDGED DAGGER LAY UPON THE FLOOR AND NEAR IT A BLACK KID GLOVE
BY GEORGE ITS BLACK GORGIANO HIMSELF CRIED THE AMERICAN
DETECTIVE SOMEONE HAS GOT AHEAD OF US THIS TIME
HERE IS THE CANDLE IN THE WINDOW MR HOLMES SAID GREGSON WHY
WHATEVER ARE YOU DOING
HOLMES HAD STEPPED ACROSS HAD LIT THE CANDLE AND WAS PASSING IT
BACKWARD AND FORWARD ACROSS THE WINDOWPANES THEN HE PEERED INTO THE
DARKNESS BLEW THE CANDLE OUT AND THREW IT ON THE FLOOR
I RATHER THINK THAT WILL BE HELPFUL SAID HE HE CAME OVER AND
STOOD IN DEEP THOUGHT WHILE THE TWO PROFESSIONALS WERE EXAMINING THE
BODY YOU SAY THAT THREE PEOPLE CAME OUT FORM THE FLAT WHILE YOU
WERE WAITING DOWNSTAIRS SAID HE AT LAST DID YOU OBSERVE THEM
CLOSELY
YES I DID
WAS THERE A FELLOW ABOUT THIRTY BLACKBEARDED DARK OF MIDDLE
SIZE
YES HE WAS THE LAST TO PASS ME
THAT IS YOUR MAN I FANCY I CAN GIVE YOU HIS DESCRIPTION AND WE
HAVE A VERY EXCELLENT OUTLINE OF HIS FOOTMARK THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH
FOR YOU
NOT MUCH MR HOLMES AMONG THE MILLIONS OF LONDON
PERHAPS NOT THAT IS WHY I THOUGHT IT BEST TO SUMMON THIS LADY TO
YOUR AID
WE ALL TURNED ROUND AT THE WORDS THERE FRAMED IN THE DOORWAY WAS A
TALL AND BEAUTIFUL WOMANTHE MYSTERIOUS LODGER OF BLOOMSBURY SLOWLY
SHE ADVANCED HER FACE PALE AND DRAWN WITH A FRIGHTFUL APPREHENSION
HER EYES FIXED AND STARING HER TERRIFIED GAZE RIVETED UPON THE DARK
FIGURE ON THE FLOOR
YOU HAVE KILLED HIM SHE MUTTERED OH DIO MIO YOU HAVE KILLED
HIM THEN I HEARD A SUDDEN SHARP INTAKE OF HER BREATH AND SHE
SPRANG INTO THE AIR WITH A CRY OF JOY ROUND AND ROUND THE ROOM SHE
DANCED HER HANDS CLAPPING HER DARK EYES GLEAMING WITH DELIGHTED
WONDER AND A THOUSAND PRETTY ITALIAN EXCLAMATIONS POURING FROM HER
LIPS IT WAS TERRIBLE AND AMAZING TO SEE SUCH A WOMAN SO CONVULSED
WITH JOY AT SUCH A SIGHT SUDDENLY SHE STOPPED AND GAZED AT US ALL
WITH A QUESTIONING STARE
BUT YOU YOU ARE POLICE ARE YOU NOT YOU HAVE KILLED GIUSEPPE
GORGIANO IS IT NOT SO
WE ARE POLICE MADAM
SHE LOOKED ROUND INTO THE SHADOWS OF THE ROOM
BUT WHERE THEN IS GENNARO SHE ASKED HE IS MY HUSBAND GENNARO
LUCCA I AM EMILIA LUCCA AND WE ARE BOTH FROM NEW YORK WHERE IS
GENNARO HE CALLED ME THIS MOMENT FROM THIS WINDOW AND I RAN WITH
ALL MY SPEED
IT WAS I WHO CALLED SAID HOLMES
YOU HOW COULD YOU CALL
YOUR CIPHER WAS NOT DIFFICULT MADAM YOUR PRESENCE HERE WAS
DESIRABLE I KNEW THAT I HAD ONLY TO FLASH VIENI AND YOU WOULD
SURELY COME
THE BEAUTIFUL ITALIAN LOOKED WITH AWE AT MY COMPANION
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU KNOW THESE THINGS SHE SAID GIUSEPPE
GORGIANOHOW DID HE SHE PAUSED AND THEN SUDDENLY HER FACE LIT UP
WITH PRIDE AND DELIGHT NOW I SEE IT MY GENNARO MY SPLENDID
BEAUTIFUL GENNARO WHO HAS GUARDED ME SAFE FROM ALL HARM HE DID IT
WITH HIS OWN STRONG HAND HE KILLED THE MONSTER OH GENNARO HOW
WONDERFUL YOU ARE WHAT WOMAN COULD EVERY BE WORTHY OF SUCH A MAN
WELL MRS LUCCA SAID THE PROSAIC GREGSON LAYING HIS HAND UPON
THE LADYS SLEEVE WITH AS LITTLE SENTIMENT AS IF SHE WERE A NOTTING
HILL HOOLIGAN I AM NOT VERY CLEAR YET WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU ARE
BUT YOUVE SAID ENOUGH TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE SHALL WANT YOU
AT THE YARD
ONE MOMENT GREGSON SAID HOLMES I RATHER FANCY THAT THIS LADY
MAY BE AS ANXIOUS TO GIVE US INFORMATION AS WE CAN BE TO GET IT YOU
UNDERSTAND MADAM THAT YOUR HUSBAND WILL BE ARRESTED AND TRIED FOR
THE DEATH OF THE MAN WHO LIES BEFORE US WHAT YOU SAY MAY BE USED IN
EVIDENCE BUT IF YOU THINK THAT HE HAS ACTED FROM MOTIVES WHICH ARE
NOT CRIMINAL AND WHICH HE WOULD WISH TO HAVE KNOWN THEN YOU CANNOT
SERVE HIM BETTER THAN BY TELLING US THE WHOLE STORY
NOW THAT GORGIANO IS DEAD WE FEAR NOTHING SAID THE LADY HE WAS A
DEVIL AND A MONSTER AND THERE CAN BE NO JUDGE IN THE WORLD WHO WOULD
PUNISH MY HUSBAND FOR HAVING KILLED HIM
IN THAT CASE SAID HOLMES MY SUGGESTION IS THAT WE LOCK THIS
DOOR LEAVE THINGS AS WE FOUND THEM GO WITH THIS LADY TO HER ROOM
AND FORM OUR OPINION AFTER WE HAVE HEARD WHAT IT IS THAT SHE HAS TO
SAY TO US
HALF AN HOUR LATER WE WERE SEATED ALL FOUR IN THE SMALL
SITTINGROOM OF SIGNORA LUCCA LISTENING TO HER REMARKABLE NARRATIVE
OF THOSE SINISTER EVENTS THE ENDING OF WHICH WE HAD CHANCED TO
WITNESS SHE SPOKE IN RAPID AND FLUENT BUT VERY UNCONVENTIONAL
ENGLISH WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF CLEARNESS I WILL MAKE GRAMMATICAL
I WAS BORN IN POSILIPPO NEAR NAPLES SAID SHE AND WAS THE
DAUGHTER OF AUGUSTO BARELLI WHO WAS THE CHIEF LAWYER AND ONCE THE
DEPUTY OF THAT PART GENNARO WAS IN MY FATHERS EMPLOYMENT AND I
CAME TO LOVE HIM AS ANY WOMAN MUST HE HAD NEITHER MONEY NOR
POSITIONNOTHING BUT HIS BEAUTY AND STRENGTH AND ENERGYSO MY
FATHER FORBADE THE MATCH WE FLED TOGETHER WERE MARRIED AT BARI AND
SOLD MY JEWELS TO GAIN THE MONEY WHICH WOULD TAKE US TO AMERICA THIS
WAS FOUR YEARS AGO AND WE HAVE BEEN IN NEW YORK EVER SINCE
FORTUNE WAS VERY GOOD TO US AT FIRST GENNARO WAS ABLE TO DO A
SERVICE TO AN ITALIAN GENTLEMANHE SAVED HIM FROM SOME RUFFIANS IN
THE PLACE CALLED THE BOWERY AND SO MADE A POWERFUL FRIEND HIS NAME
WAS TITO CASTALOTTE AND HE WAS THE SENIOR PARTNER OF THE GREAT FIRM
OF CASTALOTTE AND ZAMBA WHO ARE THE CHIEF FRUIT IMPORTERS OF NEW
YORK SIGNOR ZAMBA IS AN INVALID AND OUR NEW FRIEND CASTALOTTE HAS
ALL POWER WITHIN THE FIRM WHICH EMPLOYS MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MEN
HE TOOK MY HUSBAND INTO HIS EMPLOYMENT MADE HIM HEAD OF A
DEPARTMENT AND SHOWED HIS GOODWILL TOWARDS HIM IN EVERY WAY SIGNOR
CASTALOTTE WAS A BACHELOR AND I BELIEVE THAT HE FELT AS IF GENNARO
WAS HIS SON AND BOTH MY HUSBAND AND I LOVED HIM AS IF HE WERE OUR
FATHER WE HAD TAKEN AND FURNISHED A LITTLE HOUSE IN BROOKLYN AND
OUR WHOLE FUTURE SEEMED ASSURED WHEN THAT BLACK CLOUD APPEARED WHICH
WAS SOON TO OVERSPREAD OUR SKY
ONE NIGHT WHEN GENNARO RETURNED FROM HIS WORK HE BROUGHT A
FELLOWCOUNTRYMAN BACK WITH HIM HIS NAME WAS GORGIANO AND HE HAD
COME ALSO FROM POSILIPPO HE WAS A HUGE MAN AS YOU CAN TESTIFY FOR
YOU HAVE LOOKED UPON HIS CORPSE NOT ONLY WAS HIS BODY THAT OF A
GIANT BUT EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS GROTESQUE GIGANTIC AND
TERRIFYING HIS VOICE WAS LIKE THUNDER IN OUR LITTLE HOUSE THERE WAS
SCARCE ROOM FOR THE WHIRL OF HIS GREAT ARMS AS HE TALKED HIS
THOUGHTS HIS EMOTIONS HIS PASSIONS ALL WERE EXAGGERATED AND
MONSTROUS HE TALKED OR RATHER ROARED WITH SUCH ENERGY THAT OTHERS
COULD BUT SIT AND LISTEN COWED WITH THE MIGHTY STREAM OF WORDS HIS
EYES BLAZED AT YOU AND HELD YOU AT HIS MERCY HE WAS A TERRIBLE AND
WONDERFUL MAN I THANK GOD THAT HE IS DEAD
HE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN YET I WAS AWARE THAT GENNARO WAS NO MORE
HAPPY THAN I WAS IN HIS PRESENCE MY POOR HUSBAND WOULD SIT PALE AND
LISTLESS LISTENING TO THE ENDLESS RAVING UPON POLITICS AND UPON
SOCIAL QUESTIONS WHICH MADE UP OR VISITORS CONVERSATION GENNARO
SAID NOTHING BUT I WHO KNEW HIM SO WELL COULD READ IN HIS FACE
SOME EMOTION WHICH I HAD NEVER SEEN THERE BEFORE AT FIRST I THOUGHT
THAT IT WAS DISLIKE AND THEN GRADUALLY I UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS
MORE THAN DISLIKE IT WAS FEARA DEEP SECRET SHRINKING FEAR THAT
NIGHTTHE NIGHT THAT I READ HIS TERRORI PUT MY ARMS ROUND HIM AND
I IMPLORED HIM BY HIS LOVE FOR ME AND BY ALL THAT HE HELD DEAR TO
HOLD NOTHING FROM ME AND TO TELL ME WHY THIS HUGE MAN OVERSHADOWED
HIM SO
HE TOLD ME AND MY OWN HEART GREW COLD AS ICE AS I LISTENED MY POOR
GENNARO IN HIS WILD AND FIERY DAYS WHEN ALL THE WORLD SEEMED
AGAINST HIM AND HIS MIND WAS DRIVEN HALF MAD BY THE INJUSTICES OF
LIFE HAD JOINED A NEAPOLITAN SOCIETY THE RED CIRCLE WHICH WAS
ALLIED TO THE OLD CARBONARI THE OATHS AND SECRETS OF THIS
BROTHERHOOD WERE FRIGHTFUL BUT ONCE WITHIN ITS RULE NO ESCAPE WAS
POSSIBLE WHEN WE HAD FLED TO AMERICA GENNARO THOUGHT THAT HE HAD
CAST IT ALL OFF FOREVER WHAT WAS HIS HORROR ONE EVENING TO MEET IN
THE STREETS THE VERY MAN WHO HAD INITIATED HIM IN NAPLES THE GIANT
GORGIANO A MAN WHO HAD EARNED THE NAME OF DEATH IN THE SOUTH OF
ITALY FOR HE WAS RED TO THE ELBOW IN MURDER HE HAD COME TO NEW YORK
TO AVOID THE ITALIAN POLICE AND HE HAD ALREADY PLANTED A BRANCH OF
THIS DREADFUL SOCIETY IN HIS NEW HOME ALL THIS GENNARO TOLD ME AND
SHOWED ME A SUMMONS WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED THAT VERY DAY A RED CIRCLE
DRAWN UPON THE HEAD OF IT TELLING HIM THAT A LODGE WOULD BE HELD UPON
A CERTAIN DATE AND THAT HIS PRESENCE AT IT WAS REQUIRED AND ORDERED
THAT WAS BAD ENOUGH BUT WORSE WAS TO COME I HAD NOTICED FOR SOME
TIME THAT WHEN GORGIANO CAME TO US AS HE CONSTANTLY DID IN THE
EVENING HE SPOKE MUCH TO ME AND EVEN WHEN HIS WORDS WERE TO MY
HUSBAND THOSE TERRIBLE GLARING WILDBEAST EYES OF HIS WERE ALWAYS
TURNED UPON ME ONE NIGHT HIS SECRET CAME OUT I HAD AWAKENED WHAT HE
CALLED LOVE WITHIN HIMTHE LOVE OF A BRUTEA SAVAGE GENNARO HAD
NOT YET RETURNED WHEN HE CAME HE PUSHED HIS WAY IN SEIZED ME IN HIS
MIGHTY ARMS HUGGED ME IN HIS BEARS EMBRACE COVERED ME WITH KISSES
AND IMPLORED ME TO COME AWAY WITH HIM I WAS STRUGGLING AND SCREAMING
WHEN GENNARO ENTERED AND ATTACKED HIM HE STRUCK GENNARO SENSELESS
AND FLED FROM THE HOUSE WHICH HE WAS NEVER MORE TO ENTER IT WAS A
DEADLY ENEMY THAT WE MADE THAT NIGHT
A FEW DAYS LATER CAME THE MEETING GENNARO RETURNED FROM IT WITH A
FACE WHICH TOLD ME THAT SOMETHING DREADFUL HAD OCCURRED IT WAS WORSE
THAN WE COULD HAVE IMAGINED POSSIBLE THE FUNDS OF THE SOCIETY WERE
RAISED BY BLACKMAILING RICH ITALIANS AND THREATENING THEM WITH
VIOLENCE SHOULD THEY REFUSE THE MONEY IT SEEMS THAT CASTALOTTE OUR
DEAR FRIEND AND BENEFACTOR HAD BEEN APPROACHED HE HAD REFUSED TO
YIELD TO THREATS AND HE HAD HANDED THE NOTICES TO THE POLICE IT WAS
RESOLVED NOW THAT SUCH AN EXAMPLE SHOULD BE MADE OF THEM AS WOULD
PREVENT ANY OTHER VICTIM FROM REBELLING AT THE MEETING IT WAS
ARRANGED THAT HE AND HIS HOUSE SHOULD BE BLOWN UP WITH DYNAMITE
THERE WAS A DRAWING OF LOTS AS TO WHO SHOULD CARRY OUT THE DEED
GENNARO SAW OUR ENEMYS CRUEL FACE SMILING AT HIM AS HE DIPPED HIS
HAND IN THE BAG NO DOUBT IT HAD BEEN PREARRANGED IN SOME FASHION
FOR IT WAS THE FATAL DISC WITH THE RED CIRCLE UPON IT THE MANDATE
FOR MURDER WHICH LAY UPON HIS PALM HE WAS TO KILL HIS BEST FRIEND
OR HE WAS TO EXPOSE HIMSELF AND ME TO THE VENGEANCE OF HIS COMRADES
IT WAS PART OF THEIR FIENDISH SYSTEM TO PUNISH THOSE WHOM THEY FEARED
OR HATED BY INJURING NOT ONLY THEIR OWN PERSONS BUT THOSE WHOM THEY
LOVED AND IT WAS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS WHICH HUNG AS A TERROR OVER
MY POOR GENNAROS HEAD AND DROVE HIM NEARLY CRAZY WITH APPREHENSION
ALL THAT NIGHT WE SAT TOGETHER OUR ARMS ROUND EACH OTHER EACH
STRENGTHENING EACH FOR THE TROUBLES THAT LAY BEFORE US THE VERY NEXT
EVENING HAD BEEN FIXED FOR THE ATTEMPT BY MIDDAY MY HUSBAND AND I
WERE ON OUR WAY TO LONDON BUT NOT BEFORE HE HAD GIVEN OUR BENEFACTOR
FULL WARNING OF THIS DANGER AND HAD ALSO LEFT SUCH INFORMATION FOR
THE POLICE AS WOULD SAFEGUARD HIS LIFE FOR THE FUTURE
THE REST GENTLEMEN YOU KNOW FOR YOURSELVES WE WERE SURE THAT OUR
ENEMIES WOULD BE BEHIND US LIKE OUR OWN SHADOWS GORGIANO HAD HIS
PRIVATE REASONS FOR VENGEANCE BUT IN ANY CASE WE KNEW HOW RUTHLESS
CUNNING AND UNTIRING HE COULD BE BOTH ITALY AND AMERICA ARE FULL OF
STORIES OF HIS DREADFUL POWERS IF EVER THEY WERE EXERTED IT WOULD BE
NOW MY DARLING MADE USE OF THE FEW CLEAR DAYS WHICH OUR START HAD
GIVEN US IN ARRANGING FOR A REFUGE FOR ME IN SUCH A FASHION THAT NO
POSSIBLE DANGER COULD REACH ME FOR HIS OWN PART HE WISHED TO BE
FREE THAT HE MIGHT COMMUNICATE BOTH WITH THE AMERICAN AND WITH THE
ITALIAN POLICE I DO NOT MYSELF KNOW WHERE HE LIVED OR HOW ALL THAT
I LEARNED WAS THROUGH THE COLUMNS OF A NEWSPAPER BUT ONCE AS I
LOOKED THROUGH MY WINDOW I SAW TWO ITALIANS WATCHING THE HOUSE AND
I UNDERSTOOD THAT IN SOME WAY GORGIANO HAD FOUND OUR RETREAT FINALLY
GENNARO TOLD ME THROUGH THE PAPER THAT HE WOULD SIGNAL TO ME FROM A
CERTAIN WINDOW BUT WHEN THE SIGNALS CAME THEY WERE NOTHING BUT
WARNINGS WHICH WERE SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED IT IS VERY CLEAR TO ME NOW
THAT HE KNEW GORGIANO TO BE CLOSE UPON HIM AND THAT THANK GOD HE
WAS READY FOR HIM WHEN HE CAME AND NOW GENTLEMAN I WOULD ASK YOU
WHETHER WE HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM THE LAW OR WHETHER ANY JUDGE
UPON EARTH WOULD CONDEMN MY GENNARO FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE
WELL MR GREGSON SAID THE AMERICAN LOOKING ACROSS AT THE
OFFICIAL I DONT KNOW WHAT YOUR BRITISH POINT OF VIEW MAY BE BUT I
GUESS THAT IN NEW YORK THIS LADYS HUSBAND WILL RECEIVE A PRETTY
GENERAL VOTE OF THANKS
SHE WILL HAVE TO COME WITH ME AND SEE THE CHIEF GREGSON ANSWERED IF
WHAT SHE SAYS IS CORROBORATED I DO NOT THINK SHE OR HER HUSBAND
HAS MUCH TO FEAR BUT WHAT I CANT MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF MR HOLMES
IS HOW ON EARTH YOU GOT YOURSELF MIXED UP IN THE MATTER
EDUCATION GREGSON EDUCATION STILL SEEKING KNOWLEDGE AT THE OLD
UNIVERSITY WELL WATSON YOU HAVE ONE MORE SPECIMEN OF THE TRAGIC
AND GROTESQUE TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION BY THE WAY IT IS NOT EIGHT
OCLOCK AND A WAGNER NIGHT AT COVENT GARDEN IF WE HURRY WE MIGHT
BE IN TIME FOR THE SECOND ACT
THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCEPARTINGTON PLANS
IN THE THIRD WEEK OF NOVEMBER IN THE YEAR A DENSE YELLOW FOG
SETTLED DOWN UPON LONDON FROM THE MONDAY TO THE THURSDAY I DOUBT
WHETHER IT WAS EVER POSSIBLE FROM OUR WINDOWS IN BAKER STREET TO SEE
THE LOOM OF THE OPPOSITE HOUSES THE FIRST DAY HOLMES HAD SPENT IN
CROSSINDEXING HIS HUGE BOOK OF REFERENCES THE SECOND AND THIRD HAD
BEEN PATIENTLY OCCUPIED UPON A SUBJECT WHICH HE HAND RECENTLY MADE
HIS HOBBYTHE MUSIC OF THE MIDDLE AGES BUT WHEN FOR THE FOURTH
TIME AFTER PUSHING BACK OUR CHAIRS FROM BREAKFAST WE SAW THE GREASY
HEAVY BROWN SWIRL STILL DRIFTING PAST US AND CONDENSING IN OILY DROPS
UPON THE WINDOWPANES MY COMRADES IMPATIENT AND ACTIVE NATURE COULD
ENDURE THIS DRAB EXISTENCE NO LONGER HE PACED RESTLESSLY ABOUT OUR
SITTINGROOM IN A FEVER OF SUPPRESSED ENERGY BITING HIS NAILS
TAPPING THE FURNITURE AND CHAFING AGAINST INACTION
NOTHING OF INTEREST IN THE PAPER WATSON HE SAID
IN WAS AWARE THAT BY ANYTHING OF INTEREST HOLMES MEANT ANYTHING OF
CRIMINAL INTEREST THERE WAS THE NEWS OF A REVOLUTION OF A POSSIBLE
WAR AND OF AN IMPENDING CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT BUT THESE DID NOT COME
WITHIN THE HORIZON OF MY COMPANION I COULD SEE NOTHING RECORDED IN
THE SHAPE OF CRIME WHICH WAS NOT COMMONPLACE AND FUTILE HOLMES
GROANED AND RESUMED HS RESTLESS MEANDERINGS
THE LONDON CRIMINAL IS CERTAINLY A DULL FELLOW SAID HE IN THE
QUERULOUS VOICE OF THE SPORTSMAN WHOSE GAME HAS FAILED HIM LOOK OUT
THIS WINDOW WATSON SEE HOW THE FIGURES LOOM UP ARE DIMLY SEEN AND
THEN BLEND ONCE MORE INTO THE CLOUDBANK THE THIEF OR THE MURDERER
COULD ROAM LONDON ON SUCH A DAY AS THE TIGER DOES THE JUNGLE UNSEEN
UNTIL HE POUNCES AND THEN EVIDENT ONLY TO HIS VICTIM
THERE HAVE SAID I BEEN NUMEROUS PETTY THEFTS
HOLMES SNORTED HIS CONTEMPT
THIS GREAT AND SOMBRE STAGE IS SET FOR SOMETHING MORE WORTHY THAN
THAT SAID HE IT IS FORTUNATE FOR THIS COMMUNITY THAT I AM NOT A
CRIMINAL
IT IS INDEED SAID I HEARTILY
SUPPOSE THAT I WERE BROOKS OR WOODHOUSE OR ANY OF THE FIFTY MEN WHO
HAVE GOOD REASON FOR TAKING MY LIFE HOW LONG COULD I SURVIVE AGAINST
MY OWN PURSUIT A SUMMONS A BOGUS APPOINTMENT AND ALL WOULD BE
OVER IT IS WELL THEY DONT HAVE DAYS OF FOG IN THE LATIN
COUNTRIESTHE COUNTRIES OF ASSASSINATION BY JOVE HERE COMES
SOMETHING AT LAST TO BREAK OUR DEAD MONOTONY
IT WAS THE MAID WITH A TELEGRAM HOLMES TORE IT OPEN AND BURST OUT
LAUGHING
WELL WELL WHAT NEXT SAID HE BROTHER MYCROFT IS COMING ROUND
WHY NOT I ASKED
WHY NOT IT IS AS IF YOU MET A TRAMCAR COMING DOWN A COUNTRY LANE
MYCROFT HAS HIS RAILS AND HE RUNS ON THEM HIS PALL MALL LODGINGS
THE DIOGENES CLUB WHITEHALLTHAT IS HIS CYCLE ONCE AND ONLY ONCE
HE HAS BEEN HERE WHAT UPHEAVAL CAN POSSIBLY HAVE DERAILED HIM
DOES HE NOT EXPLAIN
HOLMES HANDED ME HIS BROTHERS TELEGRAM
MUST SEE YOU OVER CADOGEN WEST COMING AT ONCE
MYCROFT
CADOGEN WEST I HAVE HEARD THE NAME
IT RECALLS NOTHING TO MY MIND BUT THAT MYCROFT SHOULD BREAK OUT IN
THIS ERRATIC FASHION A PLANET MIGHT AS WELL LEAVE ITS ORBIT BY THE
WAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT MYCROFT IS
I HAD SOME VAGUE RECOLLECTION OF AN EXPLANATION AT THE TIME OF THE
ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER
YOU TOLD ME THAT HE HAD SOME SMALL OFFICE UNDER THE BRITISH
GOVERNMENT
HOLMES CHUCKLED
I DID NOT KNOW YOU QUITE SO WELL IN THOSE DAYS ONE HAS TO BE
DISCREET WHEN ONE TALKS OF HIGH MATTERS OF STATE YOU ARE RIGHT IN
THINKING THAT HE UNDER THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT YOU WOULD ALSO BE
RIGHT IN A SENSE IF YOU SAID THAT OCCASIONALLY HE IS THE BRITISH
GOVERNMENT
MY DEAR HOLMES
I THOUGHT I MIGHT SURPRISE YOU MYCROFT DRAWS FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY
POUNDS A YEAR REMAINS A SUBORDINATE HAS NO AMBITIONS OF ANY KIND
WILL RECEIVE NEITHER HONOUR NOR TITLE BUT REMAINS THE MOST
INDISPENSABLE MAN IN THE COUNTRY
BUT HOW
WELL HIS POSITION IS UNIQUE HE HAS MADE IT FOR HIMSELF THERE HAS
NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE NOR WILL BE AGAIN HE HAS THE
TIDIEST AND MOST ORDERLY BRAIN WITH THE GREATEST CAPACITY FOR
STORING FACTS OF ANY MAN LIVING THE SAME GREAT POWERS WHICH I HAVE
TURNED TO THE DETECTION OF CRIME HE HAS USED FOR THIS PARTICULAR
BUSINESS THE CONCLUSIONS OF EVERY DEPARTMENT ARE PASSED TO HIM AND
HE IS THE CENTRAL EXCHANGE THE CLEARINGHOUSE WHICH MAKES OUT THE
BALANCE ALL OTHER MEN ARE SPECIALISTS BUT HIS SPECIALISM IS
OMNISCIENCE WE WILL SUPPOSE THAT A MINISTER NEEDS INFORMATION AS TO
A POINT WHICH INVOLVES THE NAVY INDIA CANADA AND THE BIMETALLIC
QUESTION HE COULD GET HIS SEPARATE ADVICES FROM VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS
UPON EACH BUT ONLY MYCROFT CAN FOCUS THEM ALL AND SAY OFFHAND HOW
EACH FACTOR WOULD AFFECT THE OTHER THEY BEGAN BY USING HIM AS A
SHORTCUT A CONVENIENCE NOW HE HAS MADE HIMSELF AN ESSENTIAL IN
THAT GREAT BRAIN OF HIS EVERYTHING IS PIGEONHOLED AND CAN BE HANDED
OUT IN AN INSTANT AGAIN AND AGAIN HIS WORD HAS DECIDED THE NATIONAL
POLICY HE LIVES IN IT HE THINKS OF NOTHING ELSE SAVE WHEN AS AN
INTELLECTUAL EXERCISE HE UNBENDS IF I CALL UPON HIM AND ASK HIM TO
ADVISE ME ON ONE OF MY LITTLE PROBLEMS BUT JUPITER IS DESCENDING
TODAY WHAT ON EARTH CAN IT MEAN WHO IS CADOGAN WEST AND WHAT IS
HE TO MYCROFT
I HAVE IT I CRIED AND PLUNGED AMONG THE LITTER OF PAPERS UPON THE
SOFA YES YES HERE HE IS SURE ENOUGH CADOGEN WEST WAS THE YOUNG
MAN WHO WAS FOUND DEAD ON THE UNDERGROUND ON TUESDAY MORNING
HOLMES SAT UP AT ATTENTION HIS PIPE HALFWAY TO HIS LIPS
THIS MUST BE SERIOUS WATSON A DEATH WHICH HAS CAUSED MY BROTHER TO
ALTER HIS HABITS CAN BE NO ORDINARY ONE WHAT IN THE WORLD CAN HE
HAVE TO DO WITH IT THE CASE WAS FEATURELESS AS I REMEMBER IT THE
YOUNG MAN HAD APPARENTLY FALLEN OUT OF THE TRAIN AND KILLED HIMSELF
HE HAD NOT BEEN ROBBED AND THERE WAS NO PARTICULAR REASON TO SUSPECT
VIOLENCE IS THAT NOT SO
THERE HAS BEEN AN INQUEST SAID I AND A GOOD MANY FRESH FACTS
HAVE COME OUT LOOKED AT MORE CLOSELY I SHOULD CERTAINLY SAY THAT IT
WAS A CURIOUS CASE
JUDGING BY ITS EFFECT UPON MY BROTHER I SHOULD THINK IT MUST BE A
MOST EXTRAORDINARY ONE HE SNUGGLED DOWN IN HIS ARMCHAIR NOW
WATSON LET US HAVE THE FACTS
THE MANS NAME WAS ARTHUR CADOGAN WEST HE WAS TWENTYSEVEN YEARS OF
AGE UNMARRIED AND A CLERK AT WOOLWICH ARSENAL
GOVERNMENT EMPLOY BEHOLD THE LINK WITH BROTHER MYCROFT
HE LEFT WOOLWICH SUDDENLY ON MONDAY NIGHT WAS LAST SEEN BY HIS
FIANCEE MISS VIOLET WESTBURY WHOM HE LEFT ABRUPTLY IN THE FOG ABOUT
THAT EVENING THERE WAS NO QUARREL BETWEEN THEM AND SHE CAN GIVE
NO MOTIVE FOR HIS ACTION THE NEXT THING HEARD OF HIM WAS WHEN HIS
DEAD BODY WAS DISCOVERED BY A PLATELAYER NAMED MASON JUST OUTSIDE
ALDGATE STATION ON THE UNDERGROUND SYSTEM IN LONDON
WHEN
THE BODY WAS FOUND AT SIX ON TUESDAY MORNING IT WAS LYING WIDE OF
THE METALS UPON THE LEFT HAND OF THE TRACK AS ONE GOES EASTWARD AT A
POINT CLOSE TO THE STATION WHERE THE LINE EMERGES FROM THE TUNNEL IN
WHICH IT RUNS THE HEAD WAS BADLY CRUSHEDAN INJURY WHICH MIGHT WELL
HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A FALL FROM THE TRAIN THE BODY COULD ONLY HAVE
COME ON THE LINE IN THAT WAY HAD IT BEEN CARRIED DOWN FROM ANY
NEIGHBOURING STREET IT MUST HAVE PASSED THE STATION BARRIERS WHERE
A COLLECTOR IS ALWAYS STANDING THIS POINT SEEMS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
VERY GOOD THE CASE IS DEFINITE ENOUGH THE MAN DEAD OR ALIVE
EITHER FELL OR WAS PRECIPITATED FROM A TRAIN SO MUCH IS CLEAR TO ME
CONTINUE
THE TRAINS WHICH TRAVERSE THE LINES OF RAIL BESIDE WHICH THE BODY
WAS FOUND ARE THOSE WHICH RUN FROM WEST TO EAST SOME BEING PURELY
METROPOLITAN AND SOME FROM WILLESDEN AND OUTLYING JUNCTIONS IT CAN
BE STATED FOR CERTAIN THAT THIS YOUNG MAN WHEN HE MET HIS DEATH WAS
TRAVELLING IN THIS DIRECTION AT SOME LATE HOUR OF THE NIGHT BUT AT
WHAT POINT HE ENTERED THE TRAIN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO STATE
HIS TICKET OF COURSE WOULD SHOW THAT
THERE WAS NO TICKET IN HIS POCKETS
NO TICKET DEAR ME WATSON THIS IS REALLY VERY SINGULAR ACCORDING
TO MY EXPERIENCE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO REACH THE PLATFORM OF A
METROPOLITAN TRAIN WITHOUT EXHIBITING ONES TICKET PRESUMABLY THEN
THE YOUNG MAN HAD ONE WAS IT TAKEN FROM HIM IN ORDER TO CONCEAL THE
STATION FROM WHICH HE CAME IT IS POSSIBLE OR DID HE DROP IT IN THE
CARRIAGE THAT IS ALSO POSSIBLE BUT THE POINT IS OF CURIOUS
INTEREST I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ROBBERY
APPARENTLY NOT THERE IS A LIST HERE OF HIS POSSESSIONS HIS PURSE
CONTAINED TWO POUNDS FIFTEEN HE HAD ALSO A CHECKBOOK ON THE
WOOLWICH BRANCH OF THE CAPITAL AND COUNTIES BANK THROUGH THIS HIS
IDENTITY WAS ESTABLISHED THERE WERE ALSO TWO DRESSCIRCLE TICKETS
FOR THE WOOLWICH THEATRE DATED FOR THAT VERY EVENING ALSO A SMALL
PACKET OF TECHNICAL PAPERS
HOLMES GAVE AN EXCLAMATION OF SATISFACTION
THERE WE HAVE IT AT LAST WATSON BRITISH GOVERNMENTWOOLWICH
ARSENALTECHNICAL PAPERSBROTHER MYCROFT THE CHAIN IS COMPLETE
BUT HERE HE COMES IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN TO SPEAK FOR HIMSELF
A MOMENT LATER THE TALL AND PORTLY FORM OF MYCROFT HOLMES WAS USHERED
INTO THE ROOM HEAVILY BUILT AND MASSIVE THERE WAS A SUGGESTION OF
UNCOUTH PHYSICAL INERTIA IN THE FIGURE BUT ABOVE THIS UNWIELDY FRAME
THERE WAS PERCHED A HEAD SO MASTERFUL IN ITS BROW SO ALERT IN ITS
STEELGRAY DEEPSET EYES SO FIRM IN ITS LIPS AND SO SUBTLE IN ITS
PLAY OF EXPRESSION THAT AFTER THE FIRST GLANCE ONE FORGOT THE GROSS
BODY AND REMEMBERED ONLY THE DOMINANT MIND
AT HIS HEELS CAME OUR OLD FRIEND LESTRADE OF SCOTLAND YARDTHIN AND
AUSTERE THE GRAVITY OF BOTH THEIR FACES FORETOLD SOME WEIGHTY QUEST
THE DETECTIVE SHOOK HANDS WITHOUT A WORD MYCROFT HOLMES STRUGGLED
OUT OF HIS OVERCOAT AND SUBSIDED INTO AN ARMCHAIR
A MOST ANNOYING BUSINESS SHERLOCK SAID HE I EXTREMELY DISLIKE
ALTERING MY HABITS BUT THE POWERS THAT BE WOULD TAKE NO DENIAL IN
THE PRESENT STATE OF SIAM IT IS MOST AWKWARD THAT I SHOULD BE AWAY
FROM THE OFFICE BUT IT IS A REAL CRISIS I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE PRIME
MINISTER SO UPSET AS TO THE ADMIRALTYIT IS BUZZING LIKE AN
OVERTURNED BEEHIVE HAVE YOU READ UP THE CASE
WE HAVE JUST DONE SO WHAT WERE THE TECHNICAL PAPERS
AH THERES THE POINT FORTUNATELY IT HAS NOT COME OUT THE PRESS
WOULD BE FURIOUS IF IT DID THE PAPERS WHICH THIS WRETCHED YOUTH HAD
IN HIS POCKET WERE THE PLANS OF THE BRUCEPARTINGTON SUBMARINE
MYCROFT HOLMES SPOKE WITH A SOLEMNITY WHICH SHOWED HIS SENSE OF THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT HIS BROTHER AND I SAT EXPECTANT
SURELY YOU HAVE HEARD OF IT I THOUGHT EVERYONE HAD HEARD OF IT
ONLY AS A NAME
ITS IMPORTANCE CAN HARDLY BE EXAGGERATED IT HAS BEEN THE MOST
JEALOUSLY GUARDED OF ALL GOVERNMENT SECRETS YOU MAY TAKE IT FROM ME
THAT NAVAL WARFARE BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE WITHIN THE RADIUS OF A
BRUCEPARTINGTONS OPERATION TWO YEARS AGO A VERY LARGE SUM WAS
SMUGGLED THROUGH THE ESTIMATES AND WAS EXPENDED IN ACQUIRING A
MONOPOLY OF THE INVENTION EVERY EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO KEEP THE
SECRET THE PLANS WHICH ARE EXCEEDINGLY INTRICATE COMPRISING SOME
THIRTY SEPARATE PATENTS EACH ESSENTIAL TO THE WORKING OF THE WHOLE
ARE KEPT IN AN ELABORATE SAFE IN A CONFIDENTIAL OFFICE ADJOINING THE
ARSENAL WITH BURGLARPROOF DOORS AND WINDOWS UNDER NO CONCEIVABLE
CIRCUMSTANCES WERE THE PLANS TO BE TAKEN FROM THE OFFICE IF THE
CHIEF CONSTRUCTOR OF THE NAVY DESIRED TO CONSULT THEM EVEN HE WAS
FORCED TO GO TO THE WOOLWICH OFFICE FOR THE PURPOSE AND YET HERE WE
FIND THEM IN THE POCKET OF A DEAD JUNIOR CLERK IN THE HEART OF
LONDON FROM AN OFFICIAL POINT OF VIEW ITS SIMPLY AWFUL
BUT YOU HAVE RECOVERED THEM
NO SHERLOCK NO THATS THE PINCH WE HAVE NOT TEN PAPERS WERE
TAKEN FROM WOOLWICH THERE WERE SEVEN IN THE POCKET OF CADOGAN WEST
THE THREE MOST ESSENTIAL ARE GONESTOLEN VANISHED YOU MUST DROP
EVERYTHING SHERLOCK NEVER MIND YOUR USUAL PETTY PUZZLES OF THE
POLICECOURT ITS A VITAL INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE TO
SOLVE WHY DID CADOGAN WEST TAKE THE PAPERS WHERE ARE THE MISSING
ONES HOW DID HE DIE HOW CAME HIS BODY WHERE IT WAS FOUND HOW CAN
THE EVIL BE SET RIGHT FIND AN ANSWER TO ALL THESE QUESTIONS AND YOU
WILL HAVE DONE GOOD SERVICE FOR YOUR COUNTRY
WHY DO YOU NOT SOLVE IT YOURSELF MYCROFT YOU CAN SEE AS FAR AS I
POSSIBLY SHERLOCK BUT IT IS A QUESTION OF GETTING DETAILS GIVE ME
YOUR DETAILS AND FROM AN ARMCHAIR I WILL RETURN YOU AN EXCELLENT
EXPERT OPINION BUT TO RUN HERE AND RUN THERE TO CROSSQUESTION
RAILWAY GUARDS AND LIE ON MY FACE WITH A LENS TO MY EYEIT IS NOT
MY MTIER NO YOU ARE THE ONE MAN WHO CAN CLEAR THE MATTER UP IF
YOU HAVE A FANCY TO SEE YOUR NAME IN THE NEXT HONOURS LIST
MY FRIEND SMILED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
I PLAY THE GAME FOR THE GAMES OWN SAKE SAID HE BUT THE PROBLEM
CERTAINLY PRESENTS SOME POINTS OF INTEREST AND I SHALL BE VERY
PLEASED TO LOOK INTO IT SOME MORE FACTS PLEASE
I HAVE JOTTED DOWN THE MORE ESSENTIAL ONES UPON THIS SHEET OF PAPER
TOGETHER WITH A FEW ADDRESSES WHICH YOU WILL FIND OF SERVICE THE
ACTUAL OFFICIAL GUARDIAN OF THE PAPERS IS THE FAMOUS GOVERNMENT
EXPERT SIR JAMES WALTER WHOSE DECORATIONS AND SUBTITLES FILL TWO
LINES OF A BOOK OF REFERENCE HE HAS GROWN GRAY IN THE SERVICE IS A
GENTLEMAN A FAVOURED GUEST IN THE MOST EXALTED HOUSES AND ABOVE
ALL A MAN WHOSE PATRIOTISM IS BEYOND SUSPICION HE IS ONE OF TWO WHO
HAVE A KEY OF THE SAFE I MAY ADD THAT THE PAPERS WERE UNDOUBTEDLY IN
THE OFFICE DURING WORKING HOURS ON MONDAY AND THAT SIR JAMES LEFT
FOR LONDON ABOUT THREE OCLOCK TAKING HIS KEY WITH HIM HE WAS AT THE
HOUSE OF ADMIRAL SINCLAIR AT BARCLAY SQUARE DURING THE WHOLE OF THE
EVENING WHEN THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED
HAS THE FACT BEEN VERIFIED
YES HIS BROTHER COLONEL VALENTINE WALTER HAS TESTIFIED TO HIS
DEPARTURE FROM WOOLWICH AND ADMIRAL SINCLAIR TO HIS ARRIVAL IN
LONDON SO SIR JAMES IS NO LONGER A DIRECT FACTOR IN THE PROBLEM
WHO WAS THE OTHER MAN WITH A KEY
THE SENIOR CLERK AND DRAUGHTSMAN MR SIDNEY JOHNSON HE IS A MAN OF
FORTY MARRIED WITH FIVE CHILDREN HE IS A SILENT MOROSE MAN BUT
HE HAS ON THE WHOLE AN EXCELLENT RECORD IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE HE
IS UNPOPULAR WITH HIS COLLEAGUES BUT A HARD WORKER ACCORDING TO HIS
OWN ACCOUNT CORROBORATED ONLY BY THE WORD OF HIS WIFE HE WAS AT
HOME THE WHOLE OF MONDAY EVENING AFTER OFFICE HOURS AND HIS KEY HAS
NEVER LEFT THE WATCHCHAIN UPON WHICH IT HANGS
TELL US ABOUT CADOGAN WEST
HE HAS BEEN TEN YEARS IN THE SERVICE AND HAS DONE GOOD WORK HE HAS
THE REPUTATION OF BEING HOTHEADED AND IMPERIOUS BUT A STRAIGHT
HONEST MAN WE HAVE NOTHING AGAINST HIM HE WAS NEXT SIDNEY JOHNSON
IN THE OFFICE HIS DUTIES BROUGHT HIM INTO DAILY PERSONAL CONTACT
WITH THE PLANS NO ONE ELSE HAD THE HANDLING OF THEM
WHO LOCKED UP THE PLANS THAT NIGHT
MR SIDNEY JOHNSON THE SENIOR CLERK
WELL IT IS SURELY PERFECTLY CLEAR WHO TOOK THEM AWAY THEY ARE
ACTUALLY FOUND UPON THE PERSON OF THIS JUNIOR CLERK CADOGAN WEST
THAT SEEMS FINAL DOES IT NOT
IT DOES SHERLOCK AND YET IT LEAVES SO MUCH UNEXPLAINED IN THE
FIRST PLACE WHY DID HE TAKE THEM
I PRESUME THEY WERE OF VALUE
HE COULD HAVE GOT SEVERAL THOUSANDS FOR THEM VERY EASILY
CAN YOU SUGGEST ANY POSSIBLE MOTIVE FOR TAKING THE PAPERS TO LONDON
EXCEPT TO SELL THEM
NO I CANNOT
THEN WE MUST TAKE THAT AS OUR WORKING HYPOTHESIS YOUNG WEST TOOK
THE PAPERS NOW THIS COULD ONLY BE DONE BY HAVING A FALSE KEY
SEVERAL FALSE KEYS HE HAD TO OPEN THE BUILDING AND THE ROOM
HE HAD THEN SEVERAL FALSE KEYS HE TOOK THE PAPERS TO LONDON TO
SELL THE SECRET INTENDING NO DOUBT TO HAVE THE PLANS THEMSELVES
BACK IN THE SAFE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THEY WERE MISSED WHILE IN
LONDON ON THIS TREASONABLE MISSION HE MET HIS END
HOW
WE WILL SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS TRAVELLING BACK TO WOOLWICH WHEN HE WAS
KILLED AND THROWN OUT OF THE COMPARTMENT
ALDGATE WHERE THE BODY WAS FOUND IS CONSIDERABLY PAST THE STATION
LONDON BRIDGE WHICH WOULD BE HIS ROUTE TO WOOLWICH
MANY CIRCUMSTANCES COULD BE IMAGINED UNDER WHICH HE WOULD PASS
LONDON BRIDGE THERE WAS SOMEONE IN THE CARRIAGE FOR EXAMPLE WITH
WHOM HE WAS HAVING AN ABSORBING INTERVIEW THIS INTERVIEW LED TO A
VIOLENT SCENE IN WHICH HE LOST HIS LIFE POSSIBLY HE TRIED TO LEAVE
THE CARRIAGE FELL OUT ON THE LINE AND SO MET HIS END THE OTHER
CLOSED THE DOOR THERE WAS A THICK FOG AND NOTHING COULD BE SEEN
NO BETTER EXPLANATION CAN BE GIVEN WITH OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE AND
YET CONSIDER SHERLOCK HOW MUCH YOU LEAVE UNTOUCHED WE WILL
SUPPOSE FOR ARGUMENTS SAKE THAT YOUNG CADOGAN WEST HAD DETERMINED
TO CONVEY THESE PAPERS TO LONDON HE WOULD NATURALLY HAVE MADE AN
APPOINTMENT WITH THE FOREIGN AGENT AND KEPT HIS EVENING CLEAR
INSTEAD OF THAT HE TOOK TWO TICKETS FOR THE THEATRE ESCORTED HIS
FIANCEE HALFWAY THERE AND THEN SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
A BLIND SAID LESTRADE WHO HAD SAT LISTENING WITH SOME IMPATIENCE
TO THE CONVERSATION
A VERY SINGULAR ONE THAT IS OBJECTION NO OBJECTION NO WE
WILL SUPPOSE THAT HE REACHES LONDON AND SEES THE FOREIGN AGENT HE
MUST BRING BACK THE PAPERS BEFORE MORNING OR THE LOSS WILL BE
DISCOVERED HE TOOK AWAY TEN ONLY SEVEN WERE IN HIS POCKET WHAT HAD
BECOME OF THE OTHER THREE HE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT LEAVE THEM OF HIS
OWN FREE WILL THEN AGAIN WHERE IS THE PRICE OF HIS TREASON ONCE
WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO FIND A LARGE SUM OF MONEY IN HIS POCKET
IT SEEMS TO ME PERFECTLY CLEAR SAID LESTRADE I HAVE NO DOUBT AT
ALL AS TO WHAT OCCURRED HE TOOK THE PAPERS TO SELL THEM HE SAW THE
AGENT THEY COULD NOT AGREE AS TO PRICE HE STARTED HOME AGAIN BUT
THE AGENT WENT WITH HIM IN THE TRAIN THE AGENT MURDERED HIM TOOK
THE MORE ESSENTIAL PAPERS AND THREW HIS BODY FROM THE CARRIAGE THAT
WOULD ACCOUNT FOR EVERYTHING WOULD IT NOT
WHY HAD HE NO TICKET
THE TICKET WOULD HAVE SHOWN WHICH STATION WAS NEAREST THE AGENTS
HOUSE THEREFORE HE TOOK IT FROM THE MURDERED MANS POCKET
GOOD LESTRADE VERY GOOD SAID HOLMES YOUR THEORY HOLDS
TOGETHER BUT IF THIS IS TRUE THEN THE CASE IS AT AN END ON THE ONE
HAND THE TRAITOR IS DEAD ON THE OTHER THE PLANS OF THE
BRUCEPARTINGTON SUBMARINE ARE PRESUMABLY ALREADY ON THE CONTINENT
WHAT IS THERE FOR US TO DO
TO ACT SHERLOCKTO ACT CRIED MYCROFT SPRINGING TO HIS FEET
ALL MY INSTINCTS ARE AGAINST THIS EXPLANATION USE YOUR POWERS GO
TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME SEE THE PEOPLE CONCERNED LEAVE NO STONE
UNTURNED IN ALL YOUR CAREER YOU HAVE NEVER HAD SO GREAT A CHANCE OF
SERVING YOUR COUNTRY
WELL WELL SAID HOLMES SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS COME WATSON
AND YOU LESTRADE COULD YOU FAVOUR US WITH YOUR COMPANY FOR AN HOUR
OR TWO WE WILL BEGIN OUR INVESTIGATION BY A VISIT TO ALDGATE
STATION GOODBYE MYCROFT I SHALL LET YOU HAVE A REPORT BEFORE
EVENING BUT I WARN YOU IN ADVANCE THAT YOU HAVE LITTLE TO EXPECT
AN HOUR LATER HOLMES LESTRADE AND I STOOD UPON THE UNDERGROUND
RAILROAD AT THE POINT WHERE IT EMERGES FROM THE TUNNEL IMMEDIATELY
BEFORE ALDGATE STATION A COURTEOUS REDFACED OLD GENTLEMAN
REPRESENTED THE RAILWAY COMPANY
THIS IS WHERE THE YOUNG MANS BODY LAY SAID HE INDICATING A SPOT
ABOUT THREE FEET FROM THE METALS IT COULD NOT HAVE FALLEN FROM
ABOVE FOR THESE AS YOU SEE ARE ALL BLANK WALLS THEREFORE IT
COULD ONLY HAVE COME FROM A TRAIN AND THAT TRAIN SO FAR AS WE CAN
TRACE IT MUST HAVE PASSED ABOUT MIDNIGHT ON MONDAY
HAVE THE CARRIAGES BEEN EXAMINED FOR ANY SIGN OF VIOLENCE
THERE ARE NO SUCH SIGNS AND NO TICKET HAS BEEN FOUND
NO RECORD OF A DOOR BEING FOUND OPEN
NONE
WE HAVE HAD SOME FRESH EVIDENCE THIS MORNING SAID LESTRADE A
PASSENGER WHO PASSED ALDGATE IN AN ORDINARY METROPOLITAN TRAIN ABOUT
ON MONDAY NIGHT DECLARES THAT HE HEARD A HEAVY THUD AS OF A
BODY STRIKING THE LINE JUST BEFORE THE TRAIN REACHED THE STATION
THERE WAS DENSE FOG HOWEVER AND NOTHING COULD BE SEEN HE MADE NO
REPORT OF IT AT THE TIME WHY WHATEVER IS THE MATTER WITH MR
HOLMES
MY FRIEND WAS STANDING WITH AN EXPRESSION OF STRAINED INTENSITY UPON
HIS FACE STARING AT THE RAILWAY METALS WHERE THEY CURVED OUT OF THE
TUNNEL ALDGATE IS A JUNCTION AND THERE WAS A NETWORK OF POINTS ON
THESE HIS EAGER QUESTIONING EYES WERE FIXED AND I SAW ON HIS KEEN
ALERT FACE THAT TIGHTENING OF THE LIPS THAT QUIVER OF THE NOSTRILS
AND CONCENTRATION OF THE HEAVY TUFTED BROWS WHICH I KNEW SO WELL
POINTS HE MUTTERED THE POINTS
WHAT OF IT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I SUPPOSE THERE ARE NO GREAT NUMBER OF POINTS ON A SYSTEM SUCH AS
THIS
NO THEY ARE VERY FEW
AND A CURVE TOO POINTS AND A CURVE BY JOVE IF IT WERE ONLY SO
WHAT IS IT MR HOLMES HAVE YOU A CLUE
AN IDEAAN INDICATION NO MORE BUT THE CASE CERTAINLY GROWS IN
INTEREST UNIQUE PERFECTLY UNIQUE AND YET WHY NOT I DO NOT SEE ANY
INDICATIONS OF BLEEDING ON THE LINE
THERE WERE HARDLY ANY
BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE WOUND
THE BONE WAS CRUSHED BUT THERE WAS NO GREAT EXTERNAL INJURY
AND YET ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED SOME BLEEDING WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE
FOR ME TO INSPECT THE TRAIN WHICH CONTAINED THE PASSENGER WHO HEARD
THE THUD OF A FALL IN THE FOG
I FEAR NOT MR HOLMES THE TRAIN HAS BEEN BROKEN UP BEFORE NOW AND
THE CARRIAGES REDISTRIBUTED
I CAN ASSURE YOU MR HOLMES SAID LESTRADE THAT EVERY CARRIAGE
HAS BEEN CAREFULLY EXAMINED I SAW TO IT MYSELF
IT WAS ONE OF MY FRIENDS MOST OBVIOUS WEAKNESSES THAT HE WAS
IMPATIENT WITH LESS ALERT INTELLIGENCES THAN HIS OWN
VERY LIKELY SAID HE TURNING AWAY AS IT HAPPENS IT WAS NOT THE
CARRIAGES WHICH I DESIRED TO EXAMINE WATSON WE HAVE DONE ALL WE CAN
HERE WE NEED NOT TROUBLE YOU ANY FURTHER MR LESTRADE I THINK OUR
INVESTIGATIONS MUST NOW CARRY US TO WOOLWICH
AT LONDON BRIDGE HOLMES WROTE A TELEGRAM TO HIS BROTHER WHICH HE
HANDED TO ME BEFORE DISPATCHING IT IT RAN THUS
SEE SOME LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS BUT IT MAY POSSIBLY FLICKER OUT
MEANWHILE PLEASE SEND BY MESSENGER TO AWAIT RETURN AT BAKER STREET
A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL FOREIGN SPIES OR INTERNATIONAL AGENTS KNOWN TO
BE IN ENGLAND WITH FULL ADDRESS
SHERLOCK
THAT SHOULD BE HELPFUL WATSON HE REMARKED AS WE TOOK OUR SEATS IN
THE WOOLWICH TRAIN WE CERTAINLY OWE BROTHER MYCROFT A DEBT FOR
HAVING INTRODUCED US TO WHAT PROMISES TO BE A REALLY VERY REMARKABLE
CASE
HIS EAGER FACE STILL WORE THAT EXPRESSION OF INTENSE AND HIGHSTRUNG
ENERGY WHICH SHOWED ME THAT SOME NOVEL AND SUGGESTIVE CIRCUMSTANCE
HAD OPENED UP A STIMULATING LINE OF THOUGHT SEE THE FOXHOUND WITH
HANGING EARS AND DROOPING TAIL AS IT LOLLS ABOUT THE KENNELS AND
COMPARE IT WITH THE SAME HOUND AS WITH GLEAMING EYES AND STRAINING
MUSCLES IT RUNS UPON A BREASTHIGH SCENTSUCH WAS THE CHANGE IN
HOLMES SINCE THE MORNING HE WAS A DIFFERENT MAN FROM THE LIMP AND
LOUNGING FIGURE IN THE MOUSECOLOURED DRESSINGGOWN WHO HAD PROWLED
SO RESTLESSLY ONLY A FEW HOURS BEFORE ROUND THE FOGGIRT ROOM
THERE IS MATERIAL HERE THERE IS SCOPE SAID HE I AM DULL INDEED
NOT TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD ITS POSSIBILITIES
EVEN NOW THEY ARE DARK TO ME
THE END IS DARK TO ME ALSO BUT I HAVE HOLD OF ONE IDEA WHICH MAY
LEAD US FAR THE MAN MET HIS DEATH ELSEWHERE AND HIS BODY WAS ON THE
ROOF OF A CARRIAGE
ON THE ROOF
REMARKABLE IS IT NOT BUT CONSIDER THE FACTS IS IT A COINCIDENCE
THAT IT IS FOUND AT THE VERY POINT WHERE THE TRAIN PITCHES AND SWAYS
AS IT COMES ROUND ON THE POINTS IS NOT THAT THE PLACE WHERE AN
OBJECT UPON THE ROOF MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO FALL OFF THE POINTS WOULD
AFFECT NO OBJECT INSIDE THE TRAIN EITHER THE BODY FELL FROM THE
ROOF OR A VERY CURIOUS COINCIDENCE HAS OCCURRED BUT NOW CONSIDER
THE QUESTION OF THE BLOOD OF COURSE THERE WAS NO BLEEDING ON THE
LINE IF THE BODY HAD BLED ELSEWHERE EACH FACT IS SUGGESTIVE IN
ITSELF TOGETHER THEY HAVE A CUMULATIVE FORCE
AND THE TICKET TOO I CRIED
EXACTLY WE COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE ABSENCE OF A TICKET THIS WOULD
EXPLAIN IT EVERYTHING FITS TOGETHER
BUT SUPPOSE IT WERE SO WE ARE STILL AS FAR AS EVER FROM UNRAVELLING
THE MYSTERY OF HIS DEATH INDEED IT BECOMES NOT SIMPLER BUT
STRANGER
PERHAPS SAID HOLMES THOUGHTFULLY PERHAPS HE RELAPSED INTO A
SILENT REVERIE WHICH LASTED UNTIL THE SLOW TRAIN DREW UP AT LAST IN
WOOLWICH STATION THERE HE CALLED A CAB AND DREW MYCROFTS PAPER FROM
HIS POCKET
WE HAVE QUITE A LITTLE ROUND OF AFTERNOON CALLS TO MAKE SAID HE
I THINK THAT SIR JAMES WALTER CLAIMS OUR FIRST ATTENTION
THE HOUSE OF THE FAMOUS OFFICIAL WAS A FINE VILLA WITH GREEN LAWNS
STRETCHING DOWN TO THE THAMES AS WE REACHED IT THE FOG WAS LIFTING
AND A THIN WATERY SUNSHINE WAS BREAKING THROUGH A BUTLER ANSWERED
OUR RING
SIR JAMES SIR SAID HE WITH SOLEMN FACE SIR JAMES DIED THIS
MORNING
GOOD HEAVENS CRIED HOLMES IN AMAZEMENT HOW DID HE DIE
PERHAPS YOU WOULD CARE TO STEP IN SIR AND SEE HIS BROTHER COLONEL
VALENTINE
YES WE HAD BEST DO SO
WE WERE USHERED INTO A DIMLIT DRAWINGROOM WHERE AN INSTANT LATER
WE WERE JOINED BY A VERY TALL HANDSOME LIGHTBEARED MAN OF FIFTY
THE YOUNGER BROTHER OF THE DEAD SCIENTIST HIS WILD EYES STAINED
CHEEKS AND UNKEMPT HAIR ALL SPOKE OF THE SUDDEN BLOW WHICH HAD
FALLEN UPON THE HOUSEHOLD HE WAS HARDLY ARTICULATE AS HE SPOKE OF
IT
IT WAS THIS HORRIBLE SCANDAL SAID HE MY BROTHER SIR JAMES WAS
A MAN OF VERY SENSITIVE HONOUR AND HE COULD NOT SURVIVE SUCH AN
AFFAIR IT BROKE HIS HEART HE WAS ALWAYS SO PROUD OF THE EFFICIENCY
OF HIS DEPARTMENT AND THIS WAS A CRUSHING BLOW
WE HAD HOPED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE GIVEN US SOME INDICATIONS WHICH
WOULD HAVE HELPED US TO CLEAR THE MATTER UP
I ASSURE YOU THAT IT WAS ALL A MYSTERY TO HIM AS IT IS TO YOU AND TO
ALL OF US HE HAD ALREADY PUT ALL HIS KNOWLEDGE AT THE DISPOSAL OF
THE POLICE NATURALLY HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT CADOGAN WEST WAS GUILTY
BUT ALL THE REST WAS INCONCEIVABLE
YOU CANNOT THROW ANY NEW LIGHT UPON THE AFFAIR
I KNOW NOTHING MYSELF SAVE WHAT I HAVE READ OR HEARD I HAVE NO
DESIRE TO BE DISCOURTEOUS BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND MR HOLMES THAT
WE ARE MUCH DISTURBED AT PRESENT AND I MUST ASK YOU TO HASTEN THIS
INTERVIEW TO AN END
THIS IS INDEED AN UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT SAID MY FRIEND WHEN WE
HAD REGAINED THE CAB I WONDER IF THE DEATH WAS NATURAL OR WHETHER
THE POOR OLD FELLOW KILLED HIMSELF IF THE LATTER MAY IT BE TAKEN AS
SOME SIGN OF SELFREPROACH FOR DUTY NEGLECTED WE MUST LEAVE THAT
QUESTION TO THE FUTURE NOW WE SHALL TURN TO THE CADOGAN WESTS
A SMALL BUT WELLKEPT HOUSE IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN SHELTERED
THE BEREAVED MOTHER THE OLD LADY WAS TOO DAZED WITH GRIEF TO BE OF
ANY USE TO US BUT AT HER SIDE WAS A WHITEFACED YOUNG LADY WHO
INTRODUCED HERSELF AS MISS VIOLET WESTBURY THE FIANCEE OF THE DEAD
MAN AND THE LAST TO SEE HIM UPON THAT FATAL NIGHT
I CANNOT EXPLAIN IT MR HOLMES SHE SAID I HAVE NOT SHUT AN EYE
SINCE THE TRAGEDY THINKING THINKING THINKING NIGHT AND DAY WHAT
THE TRUE MEANING OF IT CAN BE ARTHUR WAS THE MOST SINGLEMINDED
CHIVALROUS PATRIOTIC MAN UPON EARTH HE WOULD HAVE CUT HIS RIGHT
HAND OFF BEFORE HE WOULD SELL A STATE SECRET CONFIDED TO HIS KEEPING
IT IS ABSURD IMPOSSIBLE PREPOSTEROUS TO ANYONE WHO KNEW HIM
BUT THE FACTS MISS WESTBURY
YES YES I ADMIT I CANNOT EXPLAIN THEM
WAS HE IN ANY WANT OF MONEY
NO HIS NEEDS WERE VERY SIMPLE AND HIS SALARY AMPLE HE HAD SAVED A
FEW HUNDREDS AND WE WERE TO MARRY AT THE NEW YEAR
NO SIGNS OF ANY MENTAL EXCITEMENT COME MISS WESTBURY BE
ABSOLUTELY FRANK WITH US
THE QUICK EYE OF MY COMPANION HAD NOTED SOME CHANGE IN HER MANNER
SHE COLOURED AND HESITATED
YES SHE SAID AT LAST I HAD A FEELING THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ON
HIS MIND
FOR LONG
ONLY FOR THE LAST WEEK OR SO HE WAS THOUGHTFUL AND WORRIED ONCE I
PRESSED HIM ABOUT IT HE ADMITTED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING AND THAT
IT WAS CONCERNED WITH HIS OFFICIAL LIFE IT IS TOO SERIOUS FOR ME TO
SPEAK ABOUT EVEN TO YOU SAID HE I COULD GET NOTHING MORE
HOLMES LOOKED GRAVE
GO ON MISS WESTBURY EVEN IF IT SEEMS TO TELL AGAINST HIM GO ON
WE CANNOT SAY WHAT IT MAY LEAD TO
INDEED I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO TELL ONCE OR TWICE IT SEEMED TO ME
THAT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF TELLING ME SOMETHING HE SPOKE ONE
EVENING OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SECRET AND I HAVE SOME RECOLLECTION
THAT HE SAID THAT NO DOUBT FOREIGN SPIES WOULD PAY A GREAT DEAL TO
HAVE IT
MY FRIENDS FACE GREW GRAVER STILL
ANYTHING ELSE
HE SAID THAT WE WERE SLACK ABOUT SUCH MATTERSTHAT IT WOULD BE EASY
FOR A TRAITOR TO GET THE PLANS
WAS IT ONLY RECENTLY THAT HE MADE SUCH REMARKS
YES QUITE RECENTLY
NOW TELL US OF THAT LAST EVENING
WE WERE TO GO TO THE THEATRE THE FOG WAS SO THICK THAT A CAB WAS
USELESS WE WALKED AND OUR WAY TOOK US CLOSE TO THE OFFICE SUDDENLY
HE DARTED AWAY INTO THE FOG
WITHOUT A WORD
HE GAVE AN EXCLAMATION THAT WAS ALL I WAITED BUT HE NEVER
RETURNED THEN I WALKED HOME NEXT MORNING AFTER THE OFFICE OPENED
THEY CAME TO INQUIRE ABOUT TWELVE OCLOCK WE HEARD THE TERRIBLE
NEWS OH MR HOLMES IF YOU COULD ONLY ONLY SAVE HIS HONOUR IT WAS
SO MUCH TO HIM
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY
COME WATSON SAID HE OUR WAYS LIE ELSEWHERE OUR NEXT STATION
MUST BE THE OFFICE FROM WHICH THE PAPERS WERE TAKEN
IT WAS BLACK ENOUGH BEFORE AGAINST THIS YOUNG MAN BUT OUR INQUIRIES
MAKE IT BLACKER HE REMARKED AS THE CAB LUMBERED OFF HIS COMING
MARRIAGE GIVES A MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME HE NATURALLY WANTED MONEY THE
IDEA WAS IN HIS HEAD SINCE HE SPOKE ABOUT IT HE NEARLY MADE THE
GIRL AN ACCOMPLICE IN THE TREASON BY TELLING HER HIS PLANS IT IS ALL
VERY BAD
BUT SURELY HOLMES CHARACTER GOES FOR SOMETHING THEN AGAIN WHY
SHOULD HE LEAVE THE GIRL IN THE STREET AND DART AWAY TO COMMIT A
FELONY
EXACTLY THERE ARE CERTAINLY OBJECTIONS BUT IT IS A FORMIDABLE CASE
WHICH THEY HAVE TO MEET
MR SIDNEY JOHNSON THE SENIOR CLERK MET US AT THE OFFICE AND
RECEIVED US WITH THAT RESPECT WHICH MY COMPANIONS CARD ALWAYS
COMMANDED HE WAS A THIN GRUFF BESPECTACLED MAN OF MIDDLE AGE HIS
CHEEKS HAGGARD AND HIS HANDS TWITCHING FROM THE NERVOUS STRAIN TO
WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED
IT IS BAD MR HOLMES VERY BAD HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE DEATH OF THE
CHIEF
WE HAVE JUST COME FROM HIS HOUSE
THE PLACE IS DISORGANIZED THE CHIEF DEAD CADOGAN WEST DEAD OUR
PAPERS STOLEN AND YET WHEN WE CLOSED OUR DOOR ON MONDAY EVENING WE
WERE AS EFFICIENT AN OFFICE AS ANY IN THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE GOOD
GOD ITS DREADFUL TO THINK OF THAT WEST OF ALL MEN SHOULD HAVE
DONE SUCH A THING
YOU ARE SURE OF HIS GUILT THEN
I CAN SEE NO OTHER WAY OUT OF IT AND YET I WOULD HAVE TRUSTED HIM
AS I TRUST MYSELF
AT WHAT HOUR WAS THE OFFICE CLOSED ON MONDAY
AT FIVE
DID YOU CLOSE IT
I AM ALWAYS THE LAST MAN OUT
WHERE WERE THE PLANS
IN THAT SAFE I PUT THEM THERE MYSELF
IS THERE NO WATCHMAN TO THE BUILDING
THERE IS BUT HE HAS OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO LOOK AFTER AS WELL HE IS
AN OLD SOLDIER AND A MOST TRUSTWORTHY MAN HE SAW NOTHING THAT
EVENING OF COURSE THE FOG WAS VERY THICK
SUPPOSE THAT CADOGAN WEST WISHED TO MAKE HIS WAY INTO THE BUILDING
AFTER HOURS HE WOULD NEED THREE KEYS WOULD HE NOT BEFORE THE COULD
REACH THE PAPERS
YES HE WOULD THE KEY OF THE OUTER DOOR THE KEY OF THE OFFICE AND
THE KEY OF THE SAFE
ONLY SIR JAMES WALTER AND YOU HAD THOSE KEYS
I HAD NO KEYS OF THE DOORSONLY OF THE SAFE
WAS SIR JAMES A MAN WHO WAS ORDERLY IN HIS HABITS
YES I THINK HE WAS I KNOW THAT SO FAR AS THOSE THREE KEYS ARE
CONCERNED HE KEPT THEM ON THE SAME RING I HAVE OFTEN SEEN THEM
THERE
AND THAT RING WENT WITH HIM TO LONDON
HE SAID SO
AND YOUR KEY NEVER LEFT YOUR POSSESSION
NEVER
THEN WEST IF HE IS THE CULPRIT MUST HAVE HAD A DUPLICATE AND YET
NONE WAS FOUND UPON HIS BODY ONE OTHER POINT IF A CLERK IN THIS
OFFICE DESIRED TO SELL THE PLANS WOULD IT NOT BE SIMPLY TO COPY THE
PLANS FOR HIMSELF THAN TO TAKE THE ORIGINALS AS WAS ACTUALLY DONE
IT WOULD TAKE CONSIDERABLE TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE TO COPY THE PLANS IN
AN EFFECTIVE WAY
BUT I SUPPOSE EITHER SIR JAMES OR YOU OR WEST HAS THAT TECHNICAL
KNOWLEDGE
NO DOUBT WE HAD BUT I BEG YOU WONT TRY TO DRAG ME INTO THE MATTER
MR HOLMES WHAT IS THE USE OF OUR SPECULATING IN THIS WAY WHEN THE
ORIGINAL PLANS WERE ACTUALLY FOUND ON WEST
WELL IT IS CERTAINLY SINGULAR THAT HE SHOULD RUN THE RISK OF TAKING
ORIGINALS IF HE COULD SAFELY HAVE TAKEN COPIES WHICH WOULD HAVE
EQUALLY SERVED HIS TURN
SINGULAR NO DOUBTAND YET HE DID SO
EVERY INQUIRY IN THIS CASE REVEALS SOMETHING INEXPLICABLE NOW THERE
ARE THREE PAPERS STILL MISSING THEY ARE AS I UNDERSTAND THE VITAL
ONES
YES THAT IS SO
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT ANYONE HOLDING THESE THREE PAPERS AND
WITHOUT THE SEVEN OTHERS COULD CONSTRUCT A BRUCEPARTINGTON
SUBMARINE
I REPORTED TO THAT EFFECT TO THE ADMIRALTY BUT TODAY I HAVE BEEN
OVER THE DRAWINGS AGAIN AND I AM NOT SO SURE OF IT THE DOUBLE
VALVES WITH THE AUTOMATIC SELFADJUSTING SLOTS ARE DRAWN IN ONE OF
THE PAPERS WHICH HAVE BEEN RETURNED UNTIL THE FOREIGNERS HAD
INVENTED THAT FOR THEMSELVES THEY COULD NOT MAKE THE BOAT OF COURSE
THEY MIGHT SOON GET OVER THE DIFFICULTY
BUT THE THREE MISSING DRAWINGS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT
UNDOUBTEDLY
I THINK WITH YOUR PERMISSION I WILL NOW TAKE A STROLL ROUND THE
PREMISES I DO NOT RECALL ANY OTHER QUESTION WHICH I DESIRED TO ASK
HE EXAMINED THE LOCK OF THE SAFE THE DOOR OF THE ROOM AND FINALLY
THE IRON SHUTTERS OF THE WINDOW IT WAS ONLY WHEN WE WERE ON THE LAWN
OUTSIDE THAT HIS INTEREST WAS STRONGLY EXCITED THERE WAS A LAUREL
BUSH OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AND SEVERAL OF THE BRANCHES BORE SIGNS OF
HAVING BEEN TWISTED OR SNAPPED HE EXAMINED THEM CAREFULLY WITH HIS
LENS AND THEN SOME DIM AND VAGUE MARKS UPON THE EARTH BENEATH
FINALLY HE ASKED THE CHIEF CLERK TO CLOSE THE IRON SHUTTERS AND HE
POINTED OUT TO ME THAT THEY HARDLY MET IN THE CENTRE AND THAT IT
WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR ANYONE OUTSIDE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON WITHIN
THE ROOM
THE INDICATIONS ARE RUINED BY THREE DAYS DELAY THEY MAY MEAN
SOMETHING OR NOTHING WELL WATSON I DO NOT THINK THAT WOOLWICH CAN
HELP US FURTHER IT IS A SMALL CROP WHICH WE HAVE GATHERED LET US
SEE IF WE CAN DO BETTER IN LONDON
YET WE ADDED ONE MORE SHEAF TO OUR HARVEST BEFORE WE LEFT WOOLWICH
STATION THE CLERK IN THE TICKET OFFICE WAS ABLE TO SAY WITH
CONFIDENCE THAT HE SAW CADOGAN WESTWHOM HE KNEW WELL BY SIGHTUPON
THE MONDAY NIGHT AND THAT HE WENT TO LONDON BY THE TO LONDON
BRIDGE HE WAS ALONE AND TOOK A SINGLE THIRDCLASS TICKET THE CLERK
WAS STRUCK AT THE TIME BY HIS EXCITED AND NERVOUS MANNER SO SHAKY
WAS HE THAT HE COULD HARDLY PICK UP HIS CHANGE AND THE CLERK HAD
HELPED HIM WITH IT A REFERENCE TO THE TIMETABLE SHOWED THAT THE WAS
THE FIRST TRAIN WHICH IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR WEST TO TAKE AFTER HE
HAD LEFT THE LADY ABOUT LET US RECONSTRUCT WATSON SAID HOLMES AFTER
HALF AN HOUR OF
SILENCE I AM NOT AWARE THAT IN ALL OUR JOINT RESEARCHES WE HAVE
EVER HAD A CASE WHICH WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO GET AT EVERY FRESH
ADVANCE WHICH WE MAKE ONLY REVEALS A FRESH RIDGE BEYOND AND YET WE
HAVE SURELY MADE SOME APPRECIABLE PROGRESS
THE EFFECT OF OUR INQUIRIES AT WOOLWICH HAS IN THE MAIN BEEN AGAINST
YOUNG CADOGAN WEST BUT THE INDICATIONS AT THE WINDOW WOULD LEND
THEMSELVES TO A MORE FAVOURABLE HYPOTHESIS LET US SUPPOSE FOR
EXAMPLE THAT HE HAD BEEN APPROACHED BY SOME FOREIGN AGENT IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN DONE UNDER SUCH PLEDGES AS WOULD HAVE PREVENTED HIM FROM
SPEAKING OF IT AND YET WOULD HAVE AFFECTED HIS THOUGHTS IN THE
DIRECTION INDICATED BY HIS REMARKS TO HIS FIANCEE VERY GOOD WE WILL
NOW SUPPOSE THAT AS HE WENT TO THE THEATRE WITH THE YOUNG LADY HE
SUDDENLY IN THE FOG CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THIS SAME AGENT GOING IN
THE DIRECTION OF THE OFFICE HE WAS AN IMPETUOUS MAN QUICK IN HIS
DECISIONS EVERYTHING GAVE WAY TO HIS DUTY HE FOLLOWED THE MAN
REACHED THE WINDOW SAW THE ABSTRACTION OF THE DOCUMENTS AND PURSUED
THE THIEF IN THIS WAY WE GET OVER THE OBJECTION THAT NO ONE WOULD
TAKE ORIGINALS WHEN HE COULD MAKE COPIES THIS OUTSIDER HAD TO TAKE
ORIGINALS SO FAR IT HOLDS TOGETHER
WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP
THEN WE COME INTO DIFFICULTIES ONE WOULD IMAGINE THAT UNDER SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES THE FIRST ACT OF YOUNG CADOGAN WEST WOULD BE TO SEIZE
THE VILLAIN AND RAISE THE ALARM WHY DID HE NOT DO SO COULD IT HAVE
BEEN AN OFFICIAL SUPERIOR WHO TOOK THE PAPERS THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
WESTS CONDUCT OR COULD THE CHIEF HAVE GIVEN WEST THE SLIP IN THE
FOG AND WEST STARTED AT ONCE TO LONDON TO HEAD HIM OFF FROM HIS OWN
ROOMS PRESUMING THAT HE KNEW WHERE THE ROOMS WERE THE CALL MUST
HAVE BEEN VERY PRESSING SINCE HE LEFT HIS GIRL STANDING IN THE FOG
AND MADE NO EFFORT TO COMMUNICATE WITH HER OUR SCENT RUNS COLD HERE
AND THERE IS A VAST GAP BETWEEN EITHER HYPOTHESIS AND THE LAYING OF
WESTS BODY WITH SEVEN PAPERS IN HIS POCKET ON THE ROOF OF A
METROPOLITAN TRAIN MY INSTINCT NOW IS TO WORK FORM THE OTHER END IF
MYCROFT HAS GIVEN US THE LIST OF ADDRESSES WE MAY BE ABLE TO PICK OUR
MAN AND FOLLOW TWO TRACKS INSTEAD OF ONE
SURELY ENOUGH A NOTE AWAITED US AT BAKER STREET A GOVERNMENT
MESSENGER HAD BROUGHT IT POSTHASTE HOLMES GLANCED AT IT AND THREW
IT OVER TO ME
THERE ARE NUMEROUS SMALL FRY BUT FEW WHO WOULD HANDLE SO BIG AN
AFFAIR THE ONLY MEN WORTH CONSIDERING ARE ADOLPH MAYER OF GREAT
GEORGE STREET WESTMINSTER LOUIS LA ROTHIERE OF CAMPDEN MANSIONS
NOTTING HILL AND HUGO OBERSTEIN CAULFIELD GARDENS KENSINGTON
THE LATTER WAS KNOWN TO BE IN TOWN ON MONDAY AND IS NOW REPORTED AS
HAVING LEFT GLAD TO HEAR YOU HAVE SEEN SOME LIGHT THE CABINET
AWAITS YOUR FINAL REPORT WITH THE UTMOST ANXIETY URGENT
REPRESENTATIONS HAVE ARRIVED FROM THE VERY HIGHEST QUARTER THE WHOLE
FORCE OF THE STATE IS AT YOUR BACK IF YOU SHOULD NEED IT
MYCROFT
IM AFRAID SAID HOLMES SMILING THAT ALL THE QUEENS HORSES AND
ALL THE QUEENS MEN CANNOT AVAIL IN THIS MATTER HE HAD SPREAD OUT
HIS BIG MAP OF LONDON AND LEANED EAGERLY OVER IT WELL WELL SAID
HE PRESENTLY WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF SATISFACTION THINGS ARE TURNING
A LITTLE IN OUR DIRECTION AT LAST WHY WATSON I DO HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT WE ARE GOING TO PULL IT OFF AFTER ALL HE SLAPPED ME ON THE
SHOULDER WITH A SUDDEN BURST OF HILARITY I AM GOING OUT NOW IT IS
ONLY A RECONNAISSANCE I WILL DO NOTHING SERIOUS WITHOUT MY TRUSTED
COMRADE AND BIOGRAPHER AT MY ELBOW DO YOU STAY HERE AND THE ODDS
ARE THAT YOU WILL SEE ME AGAIN IN AN HOUR OR TWO IF TIME HANGS HEAVY
GET FOOLSCAP AND A PEN AND BEGIN YOUR NARRATIVE OF HOW WE SAVED THE
STATE
I FELT SOME REFLECTION OF HIS ELATION IN MY OWN MIND FOR I KNEW WELL
THAT HE WOULD NOT DEPART SO FAR FROM HIS USUAL AUSTERITY OF DEMEANOUR
UNLESS THERE WAS GOOD CAUSE FOR EXULTATION ALL THE LONG NOVEMBER
EVENING I WAITED FILLED WITH IMPATIENCE FOR HIS RETURN AT LAST
SHORTLY AFTER NINE OCLOCK THERE ARRIVED A MESSENGER WITH A NOTE
AM DINING AT GOLDINIS RESTAURANT GLOUCESTER ROAD KENSINGTON
PLEASE COME AT ONCE AND JOIN ME THERE BRING WITH YOU A JEMMY A DARK
LANTERN A CHISEL AND A REVOLVER
SH
IT WAS A NICE EQUIPMENT FOR A RESPECTABLE CITIZEN TO CARRY THROUGH
THE DIM FOGDRAPED STREETS I STOWED THEM ALL DISCREETLY AWAY IN MY
OVERCOAT AND DROVE STRAIGHT TO THE ADDRESS GIVEN THERE SAT MY FRIEND
AT A LITTLE ROUND TABLE NEAR THE DOOR OF THE GARISH ITALIAN
RESTAURANT
HAVE YOU HAD SOMETHING TO EAT THEN JOIN ME IN A COFFEE AND CURACAO
TRY ONE OF THE PROPRIETORS CIGARS THEY ARE LESS POISONOUS THAN ONE
WOULD EXPECT HAVE YOU THE TOOLS
THEY ARE HERE IN MY OVERCOAT
EXCELLENT LET ME GIVE YOU A SHORT SKETCH OF WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH
SOME INDICATION OF WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO DO NOW IT MUST BE EVIDENT TO
YOU WATSON THAT THIS YOUNG MANS BODY WAS PLACED ON THE ROOF OF THE
TRAIN THAT WAS CLEAR FROM THE INSTANT THAT I DETERMINED THE FACT
THAT IT WAS FROM THE ROOF AND NOT FROM A CARRIAGE THAT HE HAD
FALLEN
COULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN DROPPED FROM A BRIDGE
I SHOULD SAY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU EXAMINE THE ROOFS YOU WILL
FIND THAT THEY ARE SLIGHTLY ROUNDED AND THERE IS NO RAILING ROUND
THEM THEREFORE WE CAN SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT YOUNG CADOGAN WEST WAS
PLACED ON IT
HOW COULD HE BE PLACED THERE
THAT WAS THE QUESTION WHICH WE HAD TO ANSWER THERE IS ONLY ONE
POSSIBLE WAY YOU ARE AWARE THAT THE UNDERGROUND RUNS CLEAR OF
TUNNELS AT SOME POINTS IN THE WEST END I HAD A VAGUE MEMORY THAT AS
I HAVE TRAVELLED BY IT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY SEEN WINDOWS JUST ABOVE MY
HEAD NOW SUPPOSE THAT A TRAIN HALTED UNDER SUCH A WINDOW WOULD
THERE BE ANY DIFFICULTY IN LAYING A BODY UPON THE ROOF
IT SEEMS MOST IMPROBABLE
WE MUST FALL BACK UPON THE OLD AXIOM THAT WHEN ALL OTHER
CONTINGENCIES FAIL WHATEVER REMAINS HOWEVER IMPROBABLE MUST BE THE
TRUTH HERE ALL OTHER CONTINGENCIES HAVE FAILED WHEN I FOUND THAT
THE LEADING INTERNATIONAL AGENT WHO HAD JUST LEFT LONDON LIVED IN A
ROW OF HOUSES WHICH ABUTTED UPON THE UNDERGROUND I WAS SO PLEASED
THAT YOU WERE A LITTLE ASTONISHED AT MY SUDDEN FRIVOLITY
OH THAT WAS IT WAS IT
YES THAT WAS IT MR HUGO OBERSTEIN OF CAULFIELD GARDENS HAD
BECOME MY OBJECTIVE I BEGAN MY OPERATIONS AT GLOUCESTER ROAD
STATION WHERE A VERY HELPFUL OFFICIAL WALKED WITH ME ALONG THE TRACK
AND ALLOWED ME TO SATISFY MYSELF NOT ONLY THAT THE BACKSTAIR WINDOWS
OF CAULFIELD GARDENS OPEN ON THE LINE BUT THE EVEN MORE ESSENTIAL
FACT THAT OWING TO THE INTERSECTION OF ONE OF THE LARGER RAILWAYS
THE UNDERGROUND TRAINS ARE FREQUENTLY HELD MOTIONLESS FOR SOME
MINUTES AT THAT VERY SPOT
SPLENDID HOLMES YOU HAVE GOT IT
SO FARSO FAR WATSON WE ADVANCE BUT THE GOAL IS AFAR WELL
HAVING SEEN THE BACK OF CAULFIELD GARDENS I VISITED THE FRONT AND
SATISFIED MYSELF THAT THE BIRD WAS INDEED FLOWN IT IS A CONSIDERABLE
HOUSE UNFURNISHED SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE IN THE UPPER ROOMS
OBERSTEIN LIVED THERE WITH A SINGLE VALET WHO WAS PROBABLY A
CONFEDERATE ENTIRELY IN HIS CONFIDENCE WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT
OBERSTEIN HAS GONE TO THE CONTINENT TO DISPOSE OF HIS BOOTY BUT NOT
WITH ANY IDEA OF FLIGHT FOR HE HAD NO REASON TO FEAR A WARRANT AND
THE IDEA OF AN AMATEUR DOMICILIARY VISIT WOULD CERTAINLY NEVER OCCUR
TO HIM YET THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO MAKE
COULD WE NOT GET A WARRANT AND LEGALIZE IT
HARDLY ON THE EVIDENCE
WHAT CAN WE HOPE TO DO
WE CANNOT TELL WHAT CORRESPONDENCE MAY BE THERE
I DONT LIKE IT HOLMES
MY DEAR FELLOW YOU SHALL KEEP WATCH IN THE STREET ILL DO THE
CRIMINAL PART ITS NOT A TIME TO STICK AT TRIFLES THINK OF
MYCROFTS NOTE OF THE ADMIRALTY THE CABINET THE EXALTED PERSON WHO
WAITS FOR NEWS WE ARE BOUND TO GO
MY ANSWER WAS TO RISE FROM THE TABLE
YOU ARE RIGHT HOLMES WE ARE BOUND TO GO
HE SPRANG UP AND SHOOK ME BY THE HAND
I KNEW YOU WOULD NOT SHRINK AT THE LAST SAID HE AND FOR A MOMENT
I SAW SOMETHING IN HIS EYES WHICH WAS NEARER TO TENDERNESS THAN I HAD
EVER SEEN THE NEXT INSTANT HE WAS HIS MASTERFUL PRACTICAL SELF ONCE
MORE
IT IS NEARLY HALF A MILE BUT THERE IS NO HURRY LET US WALK SAID
HE DONT DROP THE INSTRUMENTS I BEG YOUR ARREST AS A SUSPICIOUS
CHARACTER WOULD BE A MOST UNFORTUNATE COMPLICATION
CAULFIELD GARDENS WAS ONE OF THOSE LINES OF FLATFACED PILLARED AND
PORTICOED HOUSES WHICH ARE SO PROMINENT A PRODUCT OF THE MIDDLE
VICTORIAN EPOCH IN THE WEST END OF LONDON NEXT DOOR THERE APPEARED
TO BE A CHILDRENS PARTY FOR THE MERRY BUZZ OF YOUNG VOICES AND THE
CLATTER OF A PIANO RESOUNDED THROUGH THE NIGHT THE FOG STILL HUNG
ABOUT AND SCREENED US WITH ITS FRIENDLY SHADE HOLMES HAD LIT HIS
LANTERN AND FLASHED IT UPON THE MASSIVE DOOR
THIS IS A SERIOUS PROPOSITION SAID HE IT IS CERTAINLY BOLTED AS
WELL AS LOCKED WE WOULD DO BETTER IN THE AREA THERE IS AN EXCELLENT
ARCHWAY DOWN YONDER IN CASE A TOO ZEALOUS POLICEMAN SHOULD INTRUDE
GIVE ME A HAND WATSON AND ILL DO THE SAME FOR YOU
A MINUTE LATER WE WERE BOTH IN THE AREA HARDLY HAD WE REACHED THE
DARK SHADOWS BEFORE THE STEP OF THE POLICEMAN WAS HEARD IN THE FOG
ABOVE AS ITS SOFT RHYTHM DIED AWAY HOLMES SET TO WORK UPON THE
LOWER DOOR I SAW HIM STOOP AND STRAIN UNTIL WITH A SHARP CRASH IT
FLEW OPEN WE SPRANG THROUGH INTO THE DARK PASSAGE CLOSING THE AREA
DOOR BEHIND US HOLMES LET THE WAY UP THE CURVING UNCARPETED STAIR
HIS LITTLE FAN OF YELLOW LIGHT SHONE UPON A LOW WINDOW
HERE WE ARE WATSONTHIS MUST BE THE ONE HE THREW IT OPEN AND AS
HE DID SO THERE WAS A LOW HARSH MURMUR GROWING STEADILY INTO A LOUD
ROAR AS A TRAIN DASHED PAST US IN THE DARKNESS HOLMES SWEPT HIS
LIGHT ALONG THE WINDOWSILL IT WAS THICKLY COATED WITH SOOT FROM THE
PASSING ENGINES BUT THE BLACK SURFACE WAS BLURRED AND RUBBED IN
PLACES
YOU CAN SEE WHERE THEY RESTED THE BODY HALLOA WATSON WHAT IS
THIS THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT IT IS A BLOOD MARK HE WAS POINTING
TO FAINT DISCOLOURATIONS ALONG THE WOODWORK OF THE WINDOW HERE IT
IS ON THE STONE OF THE STAIR ALSO THE DEMONSTRATION IS COMPLETE LET
US STAY HERE UNTIL A TRAIN STOPS
WE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT THE VERY NEXT TRAIN ROARED FROM THE TUNNEL
AS BEFORE BUT SLOWED IN THE OPEN AND THEN WITH A CREAKING OF
BRAKES PULLED UP IMMEDIATELY BENEATH US IT WAS NOT FOUR FEET FROM
THE WINDOWLEDGE TO THE ROOF OF THE CARRIAGES HOLMES SOFTLY CLOSED
THE WINDOW
SO FAR WE ARE JUSTIFIED SAID HE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT
WATSON
A MASTERPIECE YOU HAVE NEVER RISEN TO A GREATER HEIGHT
I CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU THERE FROM THE MOMENT THAT I CONCEIVED THE
IDEA OF THE BODY BEING UPON THE ROOF WHICH SURELY WAS NOT A VERY
ABSTRUSE ONE ALL THE REST WAS INEVITABLE IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE
GRAVE INTERESTS INVOLVED THE AFFAIR UP TO THIS POINT WOULD BE
INSIGNIFICANT OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE STILL BEFORE US BUT PERHAPS WE
MAY FIND SOMETHING HERE WHICH MAY HELP US
WE HAD ASCENDED THE KITCHEN STAIR AND ENTERED THE SUITE OF ROOMS UPON
THE FIRST FLOOR ONE WAS A DININGROOM SEVERELY FURNISHED AND
CONTAINING NOTHING OF INTEREST A SECOND WAS A BEDROOM WHICH ALSO
DREW BLANK THE REMAINING ROOM APPEARED MORE PROMISING AND MY
COMPANION SETTLED DOWN TO A SYSTEMATIC EXAMINATION IT WAS LITTERED
WITH BOOKS AND PAPERS AND WAS EVIDENTLY USED AS A STUDY SWIFTLY AND
METHODICALLY HOLMES TURNED OVER THE CONTENTS OF DRAWER AFTER DRAWER
AND CUPBOARD AFTER CUPBOARD BUT NO GLEAM OF SUCCESS CAME TO BRIGHTEN
HIS AUSTERE FACE AT THE END OF AN HOUR HE WAS NO FURTHER THAN WHEN
HE STARTED
THE CUNNING DOG HAS COVERED HIS TRACKS SAID HE HE HAS LEFT
NOTHING TO INCRIMINATE HIM HIS DANGEROUS CORRESPONDENCE HAS BEEN
DESTROYED OR REMOVED THIS IS OUR LAST CHANCE
IT WAS A SMALL TIN CASHBOX WHICH STOOD UPON THE WRITINGDESK HOLMES
PRIED IT OPEN WITH HIS CHISEL SEVERAL ROLLS OF PAPER WERE WITHIN
COVERED WITH FIGURES AND CALCULATIONS WITHOUT ANY NOTE TO SHOW TO
WHAT THEY REFERRED THE RECURRING WORDS WATER PRESSURE AND
PRESSURE TO THE SQUARE INCH SUGGESTED SOME POSSIBLE RELATION TO A
SUBMARINE HOLMES TOSSED THEM ALL IMPATIENTLY ASIDE THERE ONLY
REMAINED AN ENVELOPE WITH SOME SMALL NEWSPAPER SLIPS INSIDE IT HE
SHOOK THEM OUT ON THE TABLE AND AT ONCE I SAW BY HIS EAGER FACE THAT
HIS HOPES HAD BEEN RAISED
WHATS THIS WATSON EH WHATS THIS RECORD OF A SERIES OF MESSAGES
IN THE ADVERTISEMENTS OF A PAPER DAILY TELEGRAPH AGONY COLUMN BY THE
PRINT AND PAPER RIGHTHAND TOP CORNER OF A PAGE NO DATESBUT

PIERROT
A FAIRLY COMPLETE RECORD WATSON IF WE COULD ONLY GET AT THE MAN AT
THE OTHER END HE SAT LOST IN THOUGHT TAPPING HIS FINGERS ON THE
TABLE FINALLY HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET
WELL PERHAPS IT WONT BE SO DIFFICULT AFTER ALL THERE IS NOTHING
MORE TO BE DONE HERE WATSON I THINK WE MIGHT DRIVE ROUND TO THE
OFFICES OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND SO BRING A GOOD DAYS WORK TO A
CONCLUSION
MYCROFT HOLMES AND LESTRADE HAD COME ROUND BY APPOINTMENT AFTER
BREAKFAST NEXT DAY AND SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD RECOUNTED TO THEM OUR
PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY BEFORE THE PROFESSIONAL SHOOK HIS HEAD OVER
OUR CONFESSED BURGLARY
WE CANT DO THESE THINGS IN THE FORCE MR HOLMES SAID HE NO
WONDER YOU GET RESULTS THAT ARE BEYOND US BUT SOME OF THESE DAYS
YOULL GO TOO FAR AND YOULL FIND YOURSELF AND YOUR FRIEND IN
TROUBLE
FOR ENGLAND HOME AND BEAUTYEH WATSON MARTYRS ON THE ALTAR OF
OUR COUNTRY BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT MYCROFT
EXCELLENT SHERLOCK ADMIRABLE BUT WHAT USE WILL YOU MAKE OF IT
HOLMES PICKED UP THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WHICH LAY UPON THE TABLE
HAVE YOU SEEN PIERROTS ADVERTISEMENT TODAY
WHAT ANOTHER ONE
YES HERE IT IS
TONIGHT SAME HOUR SAME PLACE TWO TAPS MOST VITALLY IMPORTANT
YOUR OWN SAFETY AT STAKE
PIERROT
BY GEORGE CRIED LESTRADE IF HE ANSWERS THAT WEVE GOT HIM
THAT WAS MY IDEA WHEN I PUT IT IN I THINK IF YOU COULD BOTH MAKE IT
CONVENIENT TO COME WITH US ABOUT EIGHT OCLOCK TO CAULFIELD GARDENS
WE MIGHT POSSIBLY GET A LITTLE NEARER TO A SOLUTION
ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS HIS
POWER OF THROWING HIS BRAIN OUT OF ACTION AND SWITCHING ALL HIS
THOUGHTS ON TO LIGHTER THINGS WHENEVER HE HAD CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT
HE COULD NO LONGER WORK TO ADVANTAGE I REMEMBER THAT DURING THE
WHOLE OF THAT MEMORABLE DAY HE LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE
HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS FOR MY OWN PART
I HAD NONE OF THIS POWER OF DETACHMENT AND THE DAY IN CONSEQUENCE
APPEARED TO BE INTERMINABLE THE GREAT NATIONAL IMPORTANCE OF THE
ISSUE THE SUSPENSE IN HIGH QUARTERS THE DIRECT NATURE OF THE
EXPERIMENT WHICH WE WERE TRYINGALL COMBINED TO WORK UPON MY NERVE
IT WAS A RELIEF TO ME WHEN AT LAST AFTER A LIGHT DINNER WE SET OUT
UPON OUR EXPEDITION LESTRADE AND MYCROFT MET US BY APPOINTMENT AT
THE OUTSIDE OF GLOUCESTER ROAD STATION THE AREA DOOR OF OBERSTEINS
HOUSE HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN THE NIGHT BEFORE AND IT WAS NECESSARY FOR
ME AS MYCROFT HOLMES ABSOLUTELY AND INDIGNANTLY DECLINED TO CLIMB
THE RAILINGS TO PASS IN AND OPEN THE HALL DOOR BY NINE OCLOCK WE
WERE ALL SEATED IN THE STUDY WAITING PATENTLY FOR OUR MAN
AN HOUR PASSED AND YET ANOTHER WHEN ELEVEN STRUCK THE MEASURED BEAT
OF THE GREAT CHURCH CLOCK SEEMED TO SOUND THE DIRGE OF OUR HOPES
LESTRADE AND MYCROFT WERE FIDGETING IN THEIR SEATS AND LOOKING TWICE
A MINUTE AT THEIR WATCHES HOLMES SAT SILENT AND COMPOSED HIS
EYELIDS HALF SHUT BUT EVERY SENSE ON THE ALERT HE RAISED HIS HEAD
WITH A SUDDEN JERK
HE IS COMING SAID HE
THERE HAD BEEN A FURTIVE STEP PAST THE DOOR NOW IT RETURNED WE
HEARD A SHUFFLING SOUND OUTSIDE AND THEN TWO SHARP TAPS WITH THE
KNOCKER HOLMES ROSE MOTIONING US TO REMAIN SEATED THE GAS IN THE
HALL WAS A MERE POINT OF LIGHT HE OPENED THE OUTER DOOR AND THEN AS
A DARK FIGURE SLIPPED PAST HIM HE CLOSED AND FASTENED IT THIS WAY
WE HEARD HIM SAY AND A MOMENT LATER OUR MAN STOOD BEFORE US HOLMES
HAD FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY AND AS THE MAN TURNED WITH A CRY OF
SURPRISE AND ALARM HE CAUGHT HIM BY THE COLLAR AND THREW HIM BACK
INTO THE ROOM BEFORE OUR PRISONER HAD RECOVERED HIS BALANCE THE DOOR
WAS SHUT AND HOLMES STANDING WITH HIS BACK AGAINST IT THE MAN GLARED
ROUND HIM STAGGERED AND FELL SENSELESS UPON THE FLOOR WITH THE
SHOCK HIS BROADBRIMMED HAT FLEW FROM HIS HEAD HIS CRAVAT SLIPPED
SOWN FROM HIS LIPS AND THERE WERE THE LONG LIGHT BEARD AND THE SOFT
HANDSOME DELICATE FEATURES OF COLONEL VALENTINE WALTER
HOLMES GAVE A WHISTLE OF SURPRISE
YOU CAN WRITE ME DOWN AN ASS THIS TIME WATSON SAID HE THIS WAS
NOT THE BIRD THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR
WHO IS HE ASKED MYCROFT EAGERLY
THE YOUNGER BROTHER OF THE LATE SIR JAMES WALTER THE HEAD OF THE
SUBMARINE DEPARTMENT YES YES I SEE THE FALL OF THE CARDS HE IS
COMING TO I THINK THAT YOU HAD BEST LEAVE HIS EXAMINATION TO ME
WE HAD CARRIED THE PROSTRATE BODY TO THE SOFA NOW OUR PRISONER SAT
UP LOOKED ROUND HIM WITH A HORRORSTRICKEN FACE AND PASSED HIS HAND
OVER HIS FOREHEAD LIKE ONE WHO CANNOT BELIEVE HIS OWN SENSES
WHAT IS THIS HE ASKED I CAME HERE TO VISIT MR OBERSTEIN
EVERYTHING IS KNOWN COLONEL WALTER SAID HOLMES HOW AN ENGLISH
GENTLEMAN COULD BEHAVE IN SUCH A MANNER IS BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION
BUT YOUR WHOLE CORRESPONDENCE AND RELATIONS WITH OBERSTEIN ARE WITHIN
OUR KNOWLEDGE SO ALSO ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE DEATH
OF YOUNG CADOGAN WEST LET ME ADVISE YOU TO GAIN AT LEAST THE SMALL
CREDIT FOR REPENTANCE AND CONFESSION SINCE THERE ARE STILL SOME
DETAILS WHICH WE CAN ONLY LEARN FROM YOUR LIPS
THE MAN GROANED AND SANK HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS WE WAITED BUT HE WAS
SILENT
I CAN ASSURE YOU SAID HOLMES THAT EVERY ESSENTIAL IS ALREADY
KNOWN WE KNOW THAT YOU WERE PRESSED FOR MONEY THAT YOU TOOK AN
IMPRESS OF THE KEYS WHICH YOUR BROTHER HELD AND THAT YOU ENTERED
INTO A CORRESPONDENCE WITH OBERSTEIN WHO ANSWERED YOUR LETTERS
THROUGH THE ADVERTISEMENT COLUMNS OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WE ARE
AWARE THAT YOU WENT DOWN TO THE OFFICE IN THE FOG ON MONDAY NIGHT
BUT THAT YOU WERE SEEN AND FOLLOWED BY YOUNG CADOGAN WEST WHO HAD
PROBABLY SOME PREVIOUS REASON TO SUSPECT YOU HE SAW YOUR THEFT BUT
COULD NOT GIVE THE ALARM AS IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE THAT YOU WERE
TAKING THE PAPERS TO YOUR BROTHER IN LONDON LEAVING ALL HIS PRIVATE
CONCERNS LIKE THE GOOD CITIZEN THAT HE WAS HE FOLLOWED YOU CLOSELY
IN THE FOG AND KEPT AT YOUR HEELS UNTIL YOU REACHED THIS VERY HOUSE
THERE HE INTERVENED AND THEN IT WAS COLONEL WALTER THAT TO TREASON
YOU ADDED THE MORE TERRIBLE CRIME OF MURDER
I DID NOT I DID NOT BEFORE GOD I SWEAR THAT I DID NOT CRIED OUR
WRETCHED PRISONER
TELL US THEN HOW CADOGAN WEST MET HIS END BEFORE YOU LAID HIM UPON
THE ROOF OF A RAILWAY CARRIAGE
I WILL I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I WILL I DID THE REST I CONFESS IT IT
WAS JUST AS YOU SAY A STOCK EXCHANGE DEBT HAD TO BE PAID I NEEDED
THE MONEY BADLY OBERSTEIN OFFERED ME FIVE THOUSAND IT WAS TO SAVE
MYSELF FROM RUIN BUT AS TO MURDER I AM AS INNOCENT AS YOU
WHAT HAPPENED THEN
HE HAD HIS SUSPICIONS BEFORE AND HE FOLLOWED ME AS YOU DESCRIBE I
NEVER KNEW IT UNTIL I WAS AT THE VERY DOOR IT WAS THICK FOG AND ONE
COULD NOT SEE THREE YARDS I HAD GIVEN TWO TAPS AND OBERSTEIN HAD
COME TO THE DOOR THE YOUNG MAN RUSHED UP AND DEMANDED TO KNOW WHAT
WE WERE ABOUT TO DO WITH THE PAPERS OBERSTEIN HAD A SHORT
LIFEPRESERVER HE ALWAYS CARRIED IT WITH HIM AS WEST FORCED HIS WAY
AFTER US INTO THE HOUSE OBERSTEIN STRUCK HIM ON THE HEAD THE BLOW
WAS A FATAL ONE HE WAS DEAD WITHIN FIVE MINUTES THERE HE LAY IN THE
HALL AND WE WERE AT OUR WITS END WHAT TO DO THEN OBERSTEIN HAD
THIS IDEA ABOUT THE TRAINS WHICH HALTED UNDER HIS BACK WINDOW BUT
FIRST HE EXAMINED THE PAPERS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT HE SAID THAT THREE
OF THEM WERE ESSENTIAL AND THAT HE MUST KEEP THEM YOU CANNOT KEEP
THEM SAID I THERE WILL BE A DREADFUL ROW AT WOOLWICH IF THEY ARE
NOT RETURNED I MUST KEEP THEM SAID HE FOR THEY ARE SO
TECHNICAL THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN THE TIME TO MAKE COPIES THEN
THEY MUST ALL GO BACK TOGETHER TONIGHT SAID I HE THOUGHT FOR A
LITTLE AND THEN HE CRIED OUT THAT HE HAD IT THREE I WILL KEEP
SAID HE THE OTHERS WE WILL STUFF INTO THE POCKET OF THIS YOUNG MAN
WHEN HE IS FOUND THE WHOLE BUSINESS WILL ASSUREDLY BE PUT TO HIS
ACCOUNT I COULD SEE NO OTHER WAY OUT OF IT SO WE DID AS HE
SUGGESTED WE WAITED HALF AN HOUR AT THE WINDOW BEFORE A TRAIN
STOPPED IT WAS SO THICK THAT NOTHING COULD BE SEEN AND WE HAD NO
DIFFICULTY IN LOWERING WESTS BODY ON TO THE TRAIN THAT WAS THE END
OF THE MATTER SO FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED
AND YOUR BROTHER
HE SAID NOTHING BUT HE HAD CAUGHT ME ONCE WITH HIS KEYS AND I
THINK THAT HE SUSPECTED I READ IN HIS EYES THAT HE SUSPECTED AS YOU
KNOW HE NEVER HELD UP HIS HEAD AGAIN
THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE ROOM IT WAS BROKEN BY MYCROFT HOLMES
CAN YOU NOT MAKE REPARATION IT WOULD EASE YOUR CONSCIENCE AND
POSSIBLY YOUR PUNISHMENT
WHAT REPARATION CAN I MAKE
WHERE IS OBERSTEIN WITH THE PAPERS
I DO NOT KNOW
DID HE GIVE YOU NO ADDRESS
HE SAID THAT LETTERS TO THE HTEL DU LOUVRE PARIS WOULD EVENTUALLY
REACH HIM
THEN REPARATION IS STILL WITHIN YOUR POWER SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
I WILL DO ANYTHING I CAN I OWE THIS FELLOW NO PARTICULAR GOODWILL
HE HAS BEEN MY RUIN AND MY DOWNFALL
HERE ARE PAPER AND PEN SIT AT THIS DESK AND WRITE TO MY DICTATION
DIRECT THE ENVELOPE TO THE ADDRESS GIVEN THAT IS RIGHT NOW THE
LETTER
DEAR SIR
WITH REGARD TO OUR TRANSACTION YOU WILL NO DOUBT HAVE OBSERVED BY
NOW THAT ONE ESSENTIAL DETAIL IS MISSING I HAVE A TRACING WHICH WILL
MAKE IT COMPLETE THIS HAS INVOLVED ME IN EXTRA TROUBLE HOWEVER AND
I MUST ASK YOU FOR A FURTHER ADVANCE OF FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS I WILL
NOT TRUST IT TO THE POST NOR WILL I TAKE ANYTHING BUT GOLD OR NOTES
I WOULD COME TO YOU ABROAD BUT IT WOULD EXCITE REMARK IF I LEFT THE
COUNTRY AT PRESENT THEREFORE I SHALL EXPECT TO MEET YOU IN THE
SMOKINGROOM OF THE CHARING CROSS HOTEL AT NOON ON SATURDAY REMEMBER
THAT ONLY ENGLISH NOTES OR GOLD WILL BE TAKEN
THAT WILL DO VERY WELL I SHALL BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED IF IT DOES
NOT FETCH OUR MAN
AND IT DID IT IS A MATTER OF HISTORYTHAT SECRET HISTORY OF A
NATION WHICH IS OFTEN SO MUCH MORE INTIMATE AND INTERESTING THAN ITS
PUBLIC CHRONICLESTHAT OBERSTEIN EAGER TO COMPLETE THE COUP OF HIS
LIFETIME CAME TO THE LURE AND WAS SAFELY ENGULFED FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
IN A BRITISH PRISON IN HIS TRUNK WERE FOUND THE INVALUABLE
BRUCEPARTINGTON PLANS WHICH HE HAD PUT UP FOR AUCTION IN ALL THE
NAVAL CENTRES OF EUROPE
COLONEL WALTER DIED IN PRISON TOWARDS THE END OF THE SECOND YEAR OF
HIS SENTENCE AS TO HOLMES HE RETURNED REFRESHED TO HIS MONOGRAPH
UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN PRINTED
FOR PRIVATE CIRCULATION AND IS SAID BY EXPERTS TO BE THE LAST WORD
UPON THE SUBJECT SOME WEEKS AFTERWARDS I LEARNED INCIDENTALLY THAT
MY FRIEND SPENT A DAY AT WINDSOR WHENCE BE RETURNED WITH A
REMARKABLY FINE EMERALD TIEPIN WHEN I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD BOUGHT
IT HE ANSWERED THAT IT WAS A PRESENT FROM A CERTAIN GRACIOUS LADY IN
WHOSE INTERESTS HE HAD ONCE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO CARRY OUT A
SMALL COMMISSION HE SAID NO MORE BUT I FANCY THAT I COULD GUESS AT
THAT LADYS AUGUST NAME AND I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE EMERALD PIN
WILL FOREVER RECALL TO MY FRIENDS MEMORY THE ADVENTURE OF THE
BRUCEPARTINGTON PLANS
THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE
MRS HUDSON THE LANDLADY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS A LONGSUFFERING
WOMAN NOT ONLY WAS HER FIRSTFLOOR FLAT INVADED AT ALL HOURS BY
THRONGS OF SINGULAR AND OFTEN UNDESIRABLE CHARACTERS BUT HER
REMARKABLE LODGER SHOWED AN ECCENTRICITY AND IRREGULARITY IN HIS LIFE
WHICH MUST HAVE SORELY TRIED HER PATIENCE HIS INCREDIBLE UNTIDINESS
HIS ADDICTION TO MUSIC AT STRANGE HOURS HIS OCCASIONAL REVOLVER
PRACTICE WITHIN DOORS HIS WEIRD AND OFTEN MALODOROUS SCIENTIFIC
EXPERIMENTS AND THE ATMOSPHERE OF VIOLENCE AND DANGER WHICH HUNG
AROUND HIM MADE HIM THE VERY WORST TENANT IN LONDON ON THE OTHER
HAND HIS PAYMENTS WERE PRINCELY I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE HOUSE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED AT THE PRICE WHICH HOLMES PAID FOR HIS
ROOMS DURING THE YEARS THAT I WAS WITH HIM
THE LANDLADY STOOD IN THE DEEPEST AWE OF HIM AND NEVER DARED TO
INTERFERE WITH HIM HOWEVER OUTRAGEOUS HIS PROCEEDINGS MIGHT SEEM
SHE WAS FOND OF HIM TOO FOR HE HAD A REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND
COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE
SEX BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT KNOWING HOW GENUINE WAS
HER REGARD FOR HIM I LISTENED EARNESTLY TO HER STORY WHEN SHE CAME
TO MY ROOMS IN THE SECOND YEAR OF MY MARRIED LIFE AND TOLD ME OF THE
SAD CONDITION TO WHICH MY POOR FRIEND WAS REDUCED
HES DYING DR WATSON SAID SHE FOR THREE DAYS HE HAS BEEN
SINKING AND I DOUBT IF HE WILL LAST THE DAY HE WOULD NOT LET ME GET
A DOCTOR THIS MORNING WHEN I SAW HIS BONES STICKING OUT OF HIS FACE
AND HIS GREAT BRIGHT EYES LOOKING AT ME I COULD STAND NO MORE OF IT
WITH YOUR LEAVE OR WITHOUT IT MR HOLMES I AM GOING FOR A DOCTOR
THIS VERY HOUR SAID I LET IT BE WATSON THEN SAID HE I
WOULDNT WASTE AN HOUR IN COMING TO HIM SIR OR YOU MAY NOT SEE HIM
ALIVE
I WAS HORRIFIED FOR I HAD HEARD NOTHING OF HIS ILLNESS I NEED NOT
SAY THAT I RUSHED FOR MY COAT AND MY HAT AS WE DROVE BACK I ASKED
FOR THE DETAILS
THERE IS LITTLE I CAN TELL YOU SIR HE HAS BEEN WORKING AT A CASE
DOWN AT ROTHERHITHE IN AN ALLEY NEAR THE RIVER AND HE HAS BROUGHT
THIS ILLNESS BACK WITH HIM HE TOOK TO HIS BED ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON
AND HAS NEVER MOVED SINCE FOR THESE THREE DAYS NEITHER FOOD NOR
DRINK HAS PASSED HIS LIPS
GOOD GOD WHY DID YOU NOT CALL IN A DOCTOR
HE WOULDNT HAVE IT SIR YOU KNOW HOW MASTERFUL HE IS I DIDNT
DARE TO DISOBEY HIM BUT HES NOT LONG FOR THIS WORLD AS YOULL SEE
FOR YOURSELF THE MOMENT THAT YOU SET EYES ON HIM
HE WAS INDEED A DEPLORABLE SPECTACLE IN THE DIM LIGHT OF A FOGGY
NOVEMBER DAY THE SICK ROOM WAS A GLOOMY SPOT BUT IT WAS THAT GAUNT
WASTED FACE STARING AT ME FROM THE BED WHICH SENT A CHILL TO MY
HEART HIS EYES HAD THE BRIGHTNESS OF FEVER THERE WAS A HECTIC FLUSH
UPON EITHER CHEEK AND DARK CRUSTS CLUNG TO HIS LIPS THE THIN HANDS
UPON THE COVERLET TWITCHED INCESSANTLY HIS VOICE WAS CROAKING AND
SPASMODIC HE LAY LISTLESSLY AS I ENTERED THE ROOM BUT THE SIGHT OF
ME BROUGHT A GLEAM OF RECOGNITION TO HIS EYES
WELL WATSON WE SEEM TO HAVE FALLEN UPON EVIL DAYS SAID HE IN A
FEEBLE VOICE BUT WITH SOMETHING OF HIS OLD CARELESSNESS OF MANNER
MY DEAR FELLOW I CRIED APPROACHING HIM
STAND BACK STAND RIGHT BACK SAID HE WITH THE SHARP IMPERIOUSNESS
WHICH I HAD ASSOCIATED ONLY WITH MOMENTS OF CRISIS IF YOU APPROACH
ME WATSON I SHALL ORDER YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE
BUT WHY
BECAUSE IT IS MY DESIRE IS THAT NOT ENOUGH
YES MRS HUDSON WAS RIGHT HE WAS MORE MASTERFUL THAN EVER IT WAS
PITIFUL HOWEVER TO SEE HIS EXHAUSTION
I ONLY WISHED TO HELP I EXPLAINED
EXACTLY YOU WILL HELP BEST BY DOING WHAT YOU ARE TOLD
CERTAINLY HOLMES
HE RELAXED THE AUSTERITY OF HIS MANNER
YOU ARE NOT ANGRY HE ASKED GASPING FOR BREATH
POOR DEVIL HOW COULD I BE ANGRY WHEN I SAW HIM LYING IN SUCH A
PLIGHT BEFORE ME
ITS FOR YOUR OWN SAKE WATSON HE CROAKED
FOR MY SAKE
I KNOW WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME IT IS A COOLIE DISEASE FROM
SUMATRAA THING THAT THE DUTCH KNOW MORE ABOUT THAN WE THOUGH THEY
HAVE MADE LITTLE OF IT UP TO DATE ONE THING ONLY IS CERTAIN IT IS
INFALLIBLY DEADLY AND IT IS HORRIBLY CONTAGIOUS
HE SPOKE NOW WITH A FEVERISH ENERGY THE LONG HANDS TWITCHING AND
JERKING AS HE MOTIONED ME AWAY
CONTAGIOUS BY TOUCH WATSONTHATS IT BY TOUCH KEEP YOUR DISTANCE
AND ALL IS WELL
GOOD HEAVENS HOLMES DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT SUCH A CONSIDERATION
WEIGHS WITH ME OF AN INSTANT IT WOULD NOT AFFECT ME IN THE CASE OF A
STRANGER DO YOU IMAGINE IT WOULD PREVENT ME FROM DOING MY DUTY TO SO
OLD A FRIEND
AGAIN I ADVANCED BUT HE REPULSED ME WITH A LOOK OF FURIOUS ANGER
IF YOU WILL STAND THERE I WILL TALK IF YOU DO NOT YOU MUST LEAVE
THE ROOM
I HAVE SO DEEP A RESPECT FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY QUALITIES OF HOLMES
THAT I HAVE ALWAYS DEFERRED TO HIS WISHES EVEN WHEN I LEAST
UNDERSTOOD THEM BUT NOW ALL MY PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS WERE AROUSED
LET HIM BE MY MASTER ELSEWHERE I AT LEAST WAS HIS IN A SICK ROOM
HOLMES SAID I YOU ARE NOT YOURSELF A SICK MAN IS BUT A CHILD
AND SO I WILL TREAT YOU WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT I WILL EXAMINE
YOUR SYMPTOMS AND TREAT YOU FOR THEM
HE LOOKED AT ME WITH VENOMOUS EYES
IF I AM TO HAVE A DOCTOR WHETHER I WILL OR NOT LET ME AT LEAST HAVE
SOMEONE IN WHOM I HAVE CONFIDENCE SAID HE
THEN YOU HAVE NONE IN ME
IN YOUR FRIENDSHIP CERTAINLY BUT FACTS ARE FACTS WATSON AND
AFTER ALL YOU ARE ONLY A GENERAL PRACTITIONER WITH VERY LIMITED
EXPERIENCE AND MEDIOCRE QUALIFICATIONS IT IS PAINFUL TO HAVE TO SAY
THESE THINGS BUT YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE
I WAS BITTERLY HURT
SUCH A REMARK IS UNWORTHY OF YOU HOLMES IT SHOWS ME VERY CLEARLY
THE STATE OF YOUR OWN NERVES BUT IF YOU HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN ME I
WOULD NOT INTRUDE MY SERVICES LET ME BRING SIR JASPER MEEK OR
PENROSE FISHER OR ANY OF THE BEST MEN IN LONDON BUT SOMEONE YOU
MUST HAVE AND THAT IS FINAL IF YOU THINK THAT I AM GOING TO STAND
HERE AND SEE YOU DIE WITHOUT EITHER HELPING YOU MYSELF OR BRINGING
ANYONE ELSE TO HELP YOU THEN YOU HAVE MISTAKEN YOUR MAN
YOU MEAN WELL WATSON SAID THE SICK MAN WITH SOMETHING BETWEEN A
SOB AND A GROAN SHALL I DEMONSTRATE YOUR OWN IGNORANCE WHAT DO YOU
KNOW PRAY OF TAPANULI FEVER WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF THE BLACK FORMOSA
CORRUPTION
I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF EITHER
THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS OF DISEASE MANY STRANGE PATHOLOGICAL
POSSIBILITIES IN THE EAST WATSON HE PAUSED AFTER EACH SENTENCE TO
COLLECT HIS FAILING STRENGTH I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH DURING SOME
RECENT RESEARCHES WHICH HAVE A MEDICOCRIMINAL ASPECT IT WAS IN THE
COURSE OF THEM THAT I CONTRACTED THIS COMPLAINT YOU CAN DO NOTHING
POSSIBLY NOT BUT I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT DR AINSTREE THE GREATEST
LIVING AUTHORITY UPON TROPICAL DISEASE IS NOW IN LONDON ALL
REMONSTRANCE IS USELESS HOLMES I AM GOING THIS INSTANT TO FETCH
HIM I TURNED RESOLUTELY TO THE DOOR
NEVER HAVE I HAD SUCH A SHOCK IN AN INSTANT WITH A TIGERSPRING
THE DYING MAN HAD INTERCEPTED ME I HEARD THE SHARP SNAP OF A TWISTED
KEY THE NEXT MOMENT HE HAD STAGGERED BACK TO HIS BED EXHAUSTED AND
PANTING AFTER HIS ONE TREMENDOUS OUTFLAME OF ENERGY
YOU WONT TAKE THE KEY FROM BE BY FORCE WATSON IVE GOT YOU MY
FRIEND HERE YOU ARE AND HERE YOU WILL STAY UNTIL I WILL OTHERWISE
BUT ILL HUMOUR YOU ALL THIS IN LITTLE GASPS WITH TERRIBLE
STRUGGLES FOR BREATH BETWEEN YOUVE ONLY MY OWN GOOD AT HEART OF

ELECTRICITY INTO A NONCONDUCTOR AT SIX WATSON WE RESUME OUR
CONVERSATION
BUT IT WAS DESTINED TO BE RESUMED LONG BEFORE THAT HOUR AND IN
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH GAVE ME A SHOCK HARDLY SECOND TO THAT CAUSED BY
HIS SPRING TO THE DOOR I HAD STOOD FOR SOME MINUTES LOOKING AT THE
SILENT FIGURE IN THE BED HIS FACE WAS ALMOST COVERED BY THE CLOTHES
AND HE APPEARED TO BE ASLEEP THEN UNABLE TO SETTLE DOWN TO READING
I WALKED SLOWLY ROUND THE ROOM EXAMINING THE PICTURES OF CELEBRATED
CRIMINALS WITH WHICH EVERY WALL WAS ADORNED FINALLY IN MY AIMLESS
PERAMBULATION I CAME TO THE MANTELPIECE A LITTER OF PIPES
TOBACCOPOUCHES SYRINGES PENKNIVES REVOLVERCARTRIDGES AND OTHER
DEBRIS WAS SCATTERED OVER IT IN THE MIDST OF THESE WAS A SMALL BLACK
AND WHITE IVORY BOX WITH A SLIDING LID IT WAS A NEAT LITTLE THING
AND I HAD STRETCHED OUT MY HAND TO EXAMINE IT MORE CLOSELY WHEN
IT WAS A DREADFUL CRY THAT HE GAVEA YELL WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN
HEARD DOWN THE STREET MY SKIN WENT COLD AND MY HAIR BRISTLED AT THAT
HORRIBLE SCREAM AS I TURNED I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A CONVULSED FACE
AND FRANTIC EYES I STOOD PARALYZED WITH THE LITTLE BOX IN MY HAND
PUT IT DOWN DOWN THIS INSTANT WATSONTHIS INSTANT I SAY HIS
HEAD SANK BACK UPON THE PILLOW AND HE GAVE A DEEP SIGH OF RELIEF AS I
REPLACED THE BOX UPON THE MANTELPIECE I HATE TO HAVE MY THINGS
TOUCHED WATSON YOU KNOW THAT I HATE IT YOU FIDGET ME BEYOND
ENDURANCE YOU A DOCTORYOU ARE ENOUGH TO DRIVE A PATIENT INTO AN
ASYLUM SIT DOWN MAN AND LET ME HAVE MY REST
THE INCIDENT LEFT A MOST UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION UPON MY MIND THE
VIOLENT AND CAUSELESS EXCITEMENT FOLLOWED BY THIS BRUTALITY OF
SPEECH SO FAR REMOVED FROM HIS USUAL SUAVITY SHOWED ME HOW DEEP WAS
THE DISORGANIZATION OF HIS MIND OF ALL RUINS THAT OF A NOBLE MIND
IS THE MOST DEPLORABLE I SAT IN SILENT DEJECTION UNTIL THE
STIPULATED TIME HAD PASSED HE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE CLOCK

TO TELL THE TRUTH MY DESIRE TO FETCH A DOCTOR HAD SOMEWHAT WEAKENED
FOR POOR HOLMES WAS SO OBVIOUSLY DELIRIOUS THAT IT SEEMED DANGEROUS
TO LEAVE HIM HOWEVER HE WAS AS EAGER NOW TO CONSULT THE PERSON
NAMED AS HE HAD BEEN OBSTINATE IN REFUSING
I NEVER HEARD THE NAME SAID I
POSSIBLY NOT MY GOOD WATSON IT MAY SURPRISE YOU TO KNOW THAT THE
MAN UPON EARTH WHO IS BEST VERSED IN THIS DISEASE IS NOT A MEDICAL
MAN BUT A PLANTER MR CULVERTON SMITH IS A WELLKNOWN RESIDENT OF
SUMATRA NOW VISITING LONDON AN OUTBREAK OF THE DISEASE UPON HIS
PLANTATION WHICH WAS DISTANT FROM MEDICAL AID CAUSED HIM TO STUDY
IT HIMSELF WITH SOME RATHER FARREACHING CONSEQUENCES HE IS A VERY
METHODICAL PERSON AND I DID NOT DESIRE YOU TO START BEFORE SIX
BECAUSE I WAS WELL AWARE THAT YOU WOULD NOT FIND HIM IN HIS STUDY IF
YOU COULD PERSUADE HIM TO COME HERE AND GIVE US THE BENEFIT OF HIS
UNIQUE EXPERIENCE OF THIS DISEASE THE INVESTIGATION OF WHICH HAS
BEEN HIS DEAREST HOBBY I CANNOT DOUBT THAT HE COULD HELP ME
I GAVE HOLMESS REMARKS AS A CONSECUTIVE WHOLE AND WILL NOT ATTEMPT
TO INDICATE HOW THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY GASPINGS FOR BREATH AND
THOSE CLUTCHINGS OF HIS HANDS WHICH INDICATED THE PAIN FROM WHICH HE
WAS SUFFERING HIS APPEARANCE HAD CHANGED FOR THE WORSE DURING THE
FEW HOURS THAT I HAD BEEN WITH HIM THOSE HECTIC SPOTS WERE MORE
PRONOUNCED THE EYES SHONE MORE BRIGHTLY OUT OF DARKER HOLLOWS AND A
COLD SWEAT GLIMMERED UPON HIS BROW HE STILL RETAINED HOWEVER THE
JAUNTY GALLANTRY OF HIS SPEECH TO THE LAST GASP HE WOULD ALWAYS BE
THE MASTER
YOU WILL TELL HIM EXACTLY HOW YOU HAVE LEFT ME SAID HE YOU WILL
CONVEY THE VERY IMPRESSION WHICH IS IN YOUR OWN MINDA DYING MANA
DYING AND DELIRIOUS MAN INDEED I CANNOT THINK WHY THE WHOLE BED OF
THE OCEAN IS NOT ONE SOLID MASS OF OYSTERS SO PROLIFIC THE CREATURES

FAIL ME NO DOUBT THERE ARE NATURAL ENEMIES WHICH LIMIT THE INCREASE
OF THE CREATURES YOU AND I WATSON WE HAVE DONE OUR PART SHALL THE
WORLD THEN BE OVERRUN BY OYSTERS NO NO HORRIBLE YOULL CONVEY
ALL THAT IS IN YOUR MIND
I LEFT HIM FULL OF THE IMAGE OF THIS MAGNIFICENT INTELLECT BABBLING
LIKE A FOOLISH CHILD HE HAD HANDED ME THE KEY AND WITH A HAPPY
THOUGHT I TOOK IT WITH ME LEST HE SHOULD LOCK HIMSELF IN MRS HUDSON
WAS WAITING TREMBLING AND WEEPING IN THE PASSAGE BEHIND ME AS I
PASSED FROM THE FLAT I HEARD HOLMESS HIGH THIN VOICE IN SOME
DELIRIOUS CHANT BELOW AS I STOOD WHISTLING FOR A CAB A MAN CAME ON
ME THROUGH THE FOG
HOW IS MR HOLMES SIR HE ASKED
IT WAS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE INSPECTOR MORTON OF SCOTLAND YARD
DRESSED IN UNOFFICIAL TWEEDS
HE IS VERY ILL I ANSWERED
HE LOOKED AT ME IN A MOST SINGULAR FASHION HAD IT NOT BEEN TOO
FIENDISH I COULD HAVE IMAGINED THAT THE GLEAM OF THE FANLIGHT SHOWED
EXULTATION IN HIS FACE
I HEARD SOME RUMOUR OF IT SAID HE
THE CAB HAD DRIVEN UP AND I LEFT HIM
LOWER BURKE STREET PROVED TO BE A LINE OF FINE HOUSES LYING IN THE
VAGUE BORDERLAND BETWEEN NOTTING HILL AND KENSINGTON THE PARTICULAR
ONE AT WHICH MY CABMAN PULLED UP HAD AN AIR OF SMUG AND DEMURE
RESPECTABILITY IN ITS OLDFASHIONED IRON RAILINGS ITS MASSIVE
FOLDINGDOOR AND ITS SHINING BRASSWORK ALL WAS IN KEEPING WITH A
SOLEMN BUTLER WHO APPEARED FRAMED IN THE PINK RADIANCE OF A TINTED
ELECTRICAL LIGHT BEHIND HIM
YES MR CULVERTON SMITH IS IN DR WATSON VERY GOOD SIR I WILL
TAKE UP YOUR CARD
MY HUMBLE NAME AND TITLE DID NOT APPEAR TO IMPRESS MR CULVERTON
SMITH THROUGH THE HALFOPEN DOOR I HEARD A HIGH PETULANT
PENETRATING VOICE
WHO IS THIS PERSON WHAT DOES HE WANT DEAR ME STAPLES HOW OFTEN
HAVE I SAID THAT I AM NOT TO BE DISTURBED IN MY HOURS OF STUDY
THERE CAME A GENTLE FLOW OF SOOTHING EXPLANATION FROM THE BUTLER
WELL I WONT SEE HIM STAPLES I CANT HAVE MY WORK INTERRUPTED
LIKE THIS I AM NOT AT HOME SAY SO TELL HIM TO COME IN THE MORNING
IF HE REALLY MUST SEE ME
AGAIN THE GENTLE MURMUR
WELL WELL GIVE HIM THAT MESSAGE HE CAN COME IN THE MORNING OR HE
CAN STAY AWAY MY WORK MUST NOT BE HINDERED
I THOUGHT OF HOLMES TOSSING UPON HIS BED OF SICKNESS AND COUNTING THE
MINUTES PERHAPS UNTIL I COULD BRING HELP TO HIM IT WAS NOT A TIME
TO STAND UPON CEREMONY HIS LIFE DEPENDED UPON MY PROMPTNESS BEFORE
THE APOLOGETIC BUTLER HAD DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE I HAD PUSHED PAST HIM
AND WAS IN THE ROOM
WITH A SHRILL CRY OF ANGER A MAN ROSE FROM A RECLINING CHAIR BESIDE
THE FIRE I SAW A GREAT YELLOW FACE COARSEGRAINED AND GREASY WITH
HEAVY DOUBLECHIN AND TWO SULLEN MENACING GRAY EYES WHICH GLARED
AT ME FROM UNDER TUFTED AND SANDY BROWS A HIGH BALD HEAD HAD A SMALL
VELVET SMOKINGCAP POISED COQUETTISHLY UPON ONE SIDE OF ITS PINK
CURVE THE SKULL WAS OF ENORMOUS CAPACITY AND YET AS I LOOKED DOWN I
SAW TO MY AMAZEMENT THAT THE FIGURE OF THE MAN WAS SMALL AND FRAIL
TWISTED IN THE SHOULDERS AND BACK LIKE ONE WHO HAS SUFFERED FROM
RICKETS IN HIS CHILDHOOD
WHATS THIS HE CRIED IN A HIGH SCREAMING VOICE WHAT IS THE
MEANING OF THIS INTRUSION DIDNT I SEND YOU WORD THAT I WOULD SEE
YOU TOMORROW MORNING
I AM SORRY SAID I BUT THE MATTER CANNOT BE DELAYED MR SHERLOCK
HOLMES
THE MENTION OF MY FRIENDS NAME HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY EFFECT UPON THE
LITTLE MAN THE LOOK OF ANGER PASSED IN AN INSTANT FROM HIS FACE HIS
FEATURES BECAME TENSE AND ALERT
HAVE YOU COME FROM HOLMES HE ASKED
I HAVE JUST LEFT HIM
WHAT ABOUT HOLMES HOW IS HE
HE IS DESPERATELY ILL THAT IS WHY I HAVE COME
THE MAN MOTIONED ME TO A CHAIR AND TURNED TO RESUME HIS OWN AS HE
DID SO I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HIS FACE IN THE MIRROR OVER THE
MANTELPIECE I COULD HAVE SWORN THAT IT WAS SET IN A MALICIOUS AND
ABOMINABLE SMILE YET I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME
NERVOUS CONTRACTION WHICH I HAD SURPRISED FOR HE TURNED TO ME AN
INSTANT LATER WITH GENUINE CONCERN UPON HIS FEATURES
I AM SORRY TO HEAR THIS SAID HE I ONLY KNOW MR HOLMES THROUGH
SOME BUSINESS DEALINGS WHICH WE HAVE HAD BUT I HAVE EVERY RESPECT
FOR HIS TALENTS AND HIS CHARACTER HE IS AN AMATEUR OF CRIME AS I AM
OF DISEASE FOR HIM THE VILLAIN FOR ME THE MICROBE THERE ARE MY
PRISONS HE CONTINUED POINTING TO A ROW OF BOTTLES AND JARS WHICH
STOOD UPON A SIDE TABLE AMONG THOSE GELATINE CULTIVATIONS SOME OF
THE VERY WORST OFFENDERS IN THE WORLD ARE NOW DOING TIME
IT WAS ON ACCOUNT OF YOUR SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE THAT MR HOLMES DESIRED
TO SEE YOU HE HAS A HIGH OPINION OF YOU AND THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE
THE ONE MAN IN LONDON WHO COULD HELP HIM
THE LITTLE MAN STARTED AND THE JAUNTY SMOKINGCAP SLID TO THE FLOOR
WHY HE ASKED WHY SHOULD MR HOMES THINK THAT I COULD HELP HIM IN
HIS TROUBLE
BECAUSE OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF EASTERN DISEASES
BUT WHY SHOULD HE THINK THAT THIS DISEASE WHICH HE HAS CONTRACTED IS
EASTERN
BECAUSE IN SOME PROFESSIONAL INQUIRY HE HAS BEEN WORKING AMONG
CHINESE SAILORS DOWN IN THE DOCKS
MR CULVERTON SMITH SMILED PLEASANTLY AND PICKED UP HIS SMOKINGCAP
OH THATS ITIS IT SAID HE I TRUST THE MATTER IS NOT SO GRAVE
AS YOU SUPPOSE HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN ILL
ABOUT THREE DAYS
IS HE DELIRIOUS
OCCASIONALLY
TUT TUT THIS SOUNDS SERIOUS IT WOULD BE INHUMAN NOT TO ANSWER HIS
CALL I VERY MUCH RESENT ANY INTERRUPTION TO MY WORK DR WATSON BUT
THIS CASE IS CERTAINLY EXCEPTIONAL I WILL COME WITH YOU AT ONCE
I REMEMBERED HOLMESS INJUNCTION
I HAVE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT SAID I
VERY GOOD I WILL GO ALONE I HAVE A NOTE OF MR HOLMESS ADDRESS
YOU CAN RELY UPON MY BEING THERE WITHIN HALF AN HOUR AT MOST
IT WAS WITH A SINKING HEART THAT I REENTERED HOLMESS BEDROOM FOR
ALL THAT I KNEW THE WORST MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IN MY ABSENCE TO MY
ENORMOUS RELIEF HE HAD IMPROVED GREATLY IN THE INTERVAL HIS
APPEARANCE WAS AS GHASTLY AS EVER BUT ALL TRACE OF DELIRIUM HAD LEFT
HIM AND HE SPOKE IN A FEEBLE VOICE IT IS TRUE BUT WITH EVEN MORE
THAN HIS USUAL CRISPNESS AND LUCIDITY
WELL DID YOU SEE HIM WATSON
YES HE IS COMING
ADMIRABLE WATSON ADMIRABLE YOU ARE THE BEST OF MESSENGERS
HE WISHED TO RETURN WITH ME
THAT WOULD NEVER DO WATSON THAT WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE DID
HE ASK WHAT AILED ME
I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE CHINESE IN THE EAST END
EXACTLY WELL WATSON YOU HAVE DONE ALL THAT A GOOD FRIEND COULD
YOU CAN NOW DISAPPEAR FROM THE SCENE
I MUST WAIT AND HEAR HIS OPINION HOLMES
OF COURSE YOU MUST BUT I HAVE REASONS TO SUPPOSE THAT THIS OPINION
WOULD BE VERY MUCH MORE FRANK AND VALUABLE IF HE IMAGINES THAT WE ARE
ALONE THERE IS JUST ROOM BEHIND THE HEAD OF MY BED WATSON
MY DEAR HOLMES
I FEAR THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE WATSON THE ROOM DOES NOT LEND
ITSELF TO CONCEALMENT WHICH IS AS WELL AS IT IS THE LESS LIKELY TO
AROUSE SUSPICION BUT JUST THERE WATSON I FANCY THAT IT COULD BE
DONE SUDDENLY HE SAT UP WITH A RIGID INTENTNESS UPON HIS HAGGARD
FACE THERE ARE THE WHEELS WATSON QUICK MAN IF YOU LOVE ME AND
DONT BUDGE WHATEVER HAPPENSWHATEVER HAPPENS DO YOU HEAR DONT
SPEAK DONT MOVE JUST LISTEN WITH ALL YOUR EARS THEN IN AN
INSTANT HIS SUDDEN ACCESS OF STRENGTH DEPARTED AND HIS MASTERFUL
PURPOSEFUL TALK DRONED AWAY INTO THE LOW VAGUE MURMURINGS OF A
SEMIDELIRIOUS MAN
FROM THE HIDINGPLACE INTO WHICH I HAD BEEN SO SWIFTLY HUSTLED I
HEARD THE FOOTFALLS UPON THE STAIR WITH THE OPENING AND THE CLOSING
OF THE BEDROOM DOOR THEN TO MY SURPRISE THERE CAME A LONG SILENCE
BROKEN ONLY BY THE HEAVY BREATHINGS AND GASPINGS OF THE SICK MAN I
COULD IMAGINE THAT OUR VISITOR WAS STANDING BY THE BEDSIDE AND
LOOKING DOWN AT THE SUFFERER AT LAST THAT STRANGE HUSH WAS BROKEN
HOLMES HE CRIED HOLMES IN THE INSISTENT TONE OF ONE WHO
AWAKENS A SLEEPER CANT YOU HEAR ME HOLMES THERE WAS A RUSTLING
AS IF HE HAD SHAKEN THE SICK MAN ROUGHLY BY THE SHOULDER

HOLMESS VOICE HAD SUNK TO AN ALMOST INAUDIBLE WHISPER
WHAT IS THAT SAID SMITH TURN UP THE GAS AH THE SHADOWS BEGIN
TO FALL DO THEY YES I WILL TURN IT UP THAT I MAY SEE YOU THE
BETTER HE CROSSED THE ROOM AND THE LIGHT SUDDENLY BRIGHTENED IS
THERE ANY OTHER LITTLE SERVICE THAT I CAN DO YOU MY FRIEND
A MATCH AND A CIGARETTE
I NEARLY CALLED OUT IN MY JOY AND MY AMAZEMENT HE WAS SPEAKING IN
HIS NATURAL VOICEA LITTLE WEAK PERHAPS BUT THE VERY VOICE I KNEW
THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE AND I FELT THAT CULVERTON SMITH WAS STANDING
IN SILENT AMAZEMENT LOOKING DOWN AT HIS COMPANION
WHATS THE MEANING OF THIS I HEARD HIM SAY AT LAST IN A DRY
RASPING TONE
THE BEST WAY OF SUCCESSFULLY ACTING A PART IS TO BE IT SAID
HOLMES I GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT FOR THREE DAYS I HAVE TASTED NEITHER
FOOD NOR DRINK UNTIL YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO POUR ME OUT THAT GLASS
OF WATER BUT IT IS THE TOBACCO WHICH I FIND MOST IRKSOME AH HERE
ARE SOME CIGARETTES I HEARD THE STRIKING OF A MATCH THAT IS VERY
MUCH BETTER HALLOA HALLOA DO I HEAR THE STEP OF A FRIEND
THERE WERE FOOTFALLS OUTSIDE THE DOOR OPENED AND INSPECTOR MORTON
APPEARED
ALL IS IN ORDER AND THIS IS YOUR MAN SAID HOLMES
THE OFFICER GAVE THE USUAL CAUTIONS
I ARREST YOU ON THE CHARGE OF THE MURDER OF ONE VICTOR SAVAGE HE
CONCLUDED
AND YOU MIGHT ADD OF THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF ONE SHERLOCK HOLMES
REMARKED MY FRIEND WITH A CHUCKLE TO SAVE AN INVALID TROUBLE
INSPECTOR MR CULVERTON SMITH WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO GIVE OUR SIGNAL BY
TURNING UP THE GAS BY THE WAY THE PRISONER HAS A SMALL BOX IN THE
RIGHTHAND POCKET OF HIS COAT WHICH IT WOULD BE AS WELL TO REMOVE
THANK YOU I WOULD HANDLE IT GINGERLY IF I WERE YOU PUT IT DOWN
HERE IT MAY PLAY ITS PART IN THE TRIAL
THERE WAS A SUDDEN RUSH AND A SCUFFLE FOLLOWED BY THE CLASH OF IRON
AND A CRY OF PAIN
YOULL ONLY GET YOURSELF HURT SAID THE INSPECTOR STAND STILL
WILL YOU THERE WAS THE CLICK OF THE CLOSING HANDCUFFS
A NICE TRAP CRIED THE HIGH SNARLING VOICE IT WILL BRING YOU
INTO THE DOCK HOLMES NOT ME HE ASKED ME TO COME HERE TO CURE HIM
I WAS SORRY FOR HIM AND I CAME NOW HE WILL PRETEND NO DOUBT THAT I
HAVE SAID ANYTHING WHICH HE MAY INVENT WHICH WILL CORROBORATE HIS
INSANE SUSPICIONS YOU CAN LIE AS YOU LIKE HOLMES MY WORD IS
ALWAYS AS GOOD AS YOURS
GOOD HEAVENS CRIED HOLMES I HAD TOTALLY FORGOTTEN HIM MY DEAR
WATSON I OWE YOU A THOUSAND APOLOGIES TO THINK THAT I SHOULD HAVE
OVERLOOKED YOU I NEED NOT INTRODUCE YOU TO MR CULVERTON SMITH
SINCE I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MET SOMEWHAT EARLIER IN THE EVENING HAVE
YOU THE CAB BELOW I WILL FOLLOW YOU WHEN I AM DRESSED FOR I MAY BE
OF SOME USE AT THE STATION
I NEVER NEEDED IT MORE SAID HOLMES AS HE REFRESHED HIMSELF WITH A
GLASS OF CLARET AND SOME BISCUITS IN THE INTERVALS OF HIS TOILET
HOWEVER AS YOU KNOW MY HABITS ARE IRREGULAR AND SUCH A FEAT MEANS
LESS TO ME THAN TO MOST MEN IT WAS VERY ESSENTIAL THAT I SHOULD
IMPRESS MRS HUDSON WITH THE REALITY OF MY CONDITION SINCE SHE WAS
TO CONVEY IT TO YOU AND YOU IN TURN TO HIM YOU WONT BE OFFENDED
WATSON YOU WILL REALIZE THAT AMONG YOUR MANY TALENTS DISSIMULATION
FINDS NO PLACE AND THAT IF YOU HAD SHARED MY SECRET YOU WOULD NEVER
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPRESS SMITH WITH THE URGENT NECESSITY OF HIS
PRESENCE WHICH WAS THE VITAL POINT OF THE WHOLE SCHEME KNOWING HIS
VINDICTIVE NATURE I WAS PERFECTLY CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD COME TO LOOK
UPON HIS HANDIWORK
BUT YOUR APPEARANCE HOLMESYOUR GHASTLY FACE
THREE DAYS OF ABSOLUTE FAST DOES NOT IMPROVE ONES BEAUTY WATSON
FOR THE REST THERE IS NOTHING WHICH A SPONGE MAY NOT CURE WITH
VASELINE UPON ONES FOREHEAD BELLADONNA IN ONES EYES ROUGE OVER
THE CHEEKBONES AND CRUSTS OF BEESWAX ROUND ONES LIPS A VERY
SATISFYING EFFECT CAN BE PRODUCED MALINGERING IS A SUBJECT UPON
WHICH I HAVE SOMETIMES THOUGHT OF WRITING A MONOGRAPH A LITTLE
OCCASIONAL TALK ABOUT HALFCROWNS OYSTERS OR ANY OTHER EXTRANEOUS
SUBJECT PRODUCES A PLEASING EFFECT OF DELIRIUM
BUT WHY WOULD YOU NOT LET ME NEAR YOU SINCE THERE WAS IN TRUTH NO
INFECTION
CAN YOU ASK MY DEAR WATSON DO YOU IMAGINE THAT I HAVE NO RESPECT
FOR YOUR MEDICAL TALENTS COULD I FANCY THAT YOUR ASTUTE JUDGMENT
WOULD PASS A DYING MAN WHO HOWEVER WEAK HAD NO RISE OF PULSE OR
TEMPERATURE AT FOUR YARDS I COULD DECEIVE YOU IF I FAILED TO DO
SO WHO WOULD BRING MY SMITH WITHIN MY GRASP NO WATSON I WOULD NOT
TOUCH THAT BOX YOU CAN JUST SEE IF YOU LOOK AT IT SIDEWAYS WHERE THE
SHARP SPRING LIKE A VIPERS TOOTH EMERGES AS YOU OPEN IT I DARE SAY
IT WAS BY SOME SUCH DEVICE THAT POOR SAVAGE WHO STOOD BETWEEN THIS
MONSTER AND A REVERSION WAS DONE TO DEATH MY CORRESPONDENCE
HOWEVER IS AS YOU KNOW A VARIED ONE AND I AM SOMEWHAT UPON MY
GUARD AGAINST ANY PACKAGES WHICH REACH ME IT WAS CLEAR TO ME
HOWEVER THAT BY PRETENDING THAT HE HAD REALLY SUCCEEDED IN HIS
DESIGN I MIGHT SURPRISE A CONFESSION THAT PRETENCE I HAVE CARRIED
OUT WITH THE THOROUGHNESS OF THE TRUE ARTIST THANK YOU WATSON YOU
MUST HELP ME ON WITH MY COAT WHEN WE HAVE FINISHED AT THE
POLICESTATION I THINK THAT SOMETHING NUTRITIOUS AT SIMPSONS WOULD
NOT BE OUT OF PLACE
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF LADY FRANCES CARFAX
BUT WHY TURKISH ASKED MR SHERLOCK HOLMES GAZING FIXEDLY AT MY
BOOTS I WAS RECLINING IN A CANEBACKED CHAIR AT THE MOMENT AND MY
PROTRUDED FEET HAD ATTRACTED HIS EVERACTIVE ATTENTION
ENGLISH I ANSWERED IN SOME SURPRISE I GOT THEM AT LATIMERS IN
OXFORD STREET
HOLMES SMILED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF WEARY PATIENCE
THE BATH HE SAID THE BATH WHY THE RELAXING AND EXPENSIVE
TURKISH RATHER THAN THE INVIGORATING HOMEMADE ARTICLE
BECAUSE FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS I HAVE BEEN FEELING RHEUMATIC AND OLD
A TURKISH BATH IS WHAT WE CALL AN ALTERATIVE IN MEDICINEA FRESH
STARTINGPOINT A CLEANSER OF THE SYSTEM
BY THE WAY HOLMES I ADDED I HAVE NO DOUBT THE CONNECTION
BETWEEN MY BOOTS AND A TURKISH BATH IS A PERFECTLY SELFEVIDENT ONE
TO A LOGICAL MIND AND YET I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO YOU IF YOU WOULD
INDICATE IT
THE TRAIN OF REASONING IS NOT VERY OBSCURE WATSON SAID HOLMES
WITH A MISCHIEVOUS TWINKLE IT BELONGS TO THE SAME ELEMENTARY CLASS
OF DEDUCTION WHICH I SHOULD ILLUSTRATE IF I WERE TO ASK YOU WHO
SHARED YOUR CAB IN YOUR DRIVE THIS MORNING
I DONT ADMIT THAT A FRESH ILLUSTRATION IS AN EXPLANATION SAID I
WITH SOME ASPERITY
BRAVO WATSON A VERY DIGNIFIED AND LOGICAL REMONSTRANCE LET ME
SEE WHAT WERE THE POINTS TAKE THE LAST ONE FIRSTTHE CAB YOU
OBSERVE THAT YOU HAVE SOME SPLASHES ON THE LEFT SLEEVE AND SHOULDER
OF YOUR COAT HAD YOU SAT IN THE CENTRE OF A HANSOM YOU WOULD
PROBABLY HAVE HAD NO SPLASHES AND IF YOU HAD THEY WOULD CERTAINLY
HAVE BEEN SYMMETRICAL THEREFORE IT IS CLEAR THAT YOU SAT AT THE
SIDE THEREFORE IT IS EQUALLY CLEAR THAT YOU HAD A COMPANION
THAT IS VERY EVIDENT
ABSURDLY COMMONPLACE IS IT NOT
BUT THE BOOTS AND THE BATH
EQUALLY CHILDISH YOU ARE IN THE HABIT OF DOING UP YOUR BOOTS IN A
CERTAIN WAY I SEE THEM ON THIS OCCASION FASTENED WITH AN ELABORATE
DOUBLE BOW WHICH IS NOT YOUR USUAL METHOD OF TYING THEM YOU HAVE
THEREFORE HAD THEM OFF WHO HAS TIED THEM A BOOTMAKEROR THE BOY
AT THE BATH IT IS UNLIKELY THAT IT IS THE BOOTMAKER SINCE YOUR
BOOTS ARE NEARLY NEW WELL WHAT REMAINS THE BATH ABSURD IS IT
NOT BUT FOR ALL THAT THE TURKISH BATH HAS SERVED A PURPOSE
WHAT IS THAT
YOU SAY THAT YOU HAVE HAD IT BECAUSE YOU NEED A CHANGE LET ME
SUGGEST THAT YOU TAKE ONE HOW WOULD LAUSANNE DO MY DEAR
WATSONFIRSTCLASS TICKETS AND ALL EXPENSES PAID ON A PRINCELY
SCALE
SPLENDID BUT WHY
HOLMES LEANED BACK IN HIS ARMCHAIR AND TOOK HIS NOTEBOOK FROM HIS
POCKET
ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS CLASSES IN THE WORLD SAID HE IS THE
DRIFTING AND FRIENDLESS WOMAN SHE IS THE MOST HARMLESS AND OFTEN THE
MOST USEFUL OF MORTALS BUT SHE IS THE INEVITABLE INCITER OF CRIME IN
OTHERS SHE IS HELPLESS SHE IS MIGRATORY SHE HAS SUFFICIENT MEANS
TO TAKE HER FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND FROM HOTEL TO HOTEL SHE IS
LOST AS OFTEN AS NOT IN A MAZE OF OBSCURE PENSIONS AND
BOARDINGHOUSES SHE IS A STRAY CHICKEN IN A WORLD OF FOXES WHEN SHE
IS GOBBLED UP SHE IS HARDLY MISSED I MUCH FEAR THAT SOME EVIL HAS
COME TO THE LADY FRANCES CARFAX
I WAS RELIEVED AT THIS SUDDEN DESCENT FROM THE GENERAL TO THE
PARTICULAR HOLMES CONSULTED HIS NOTES
LADY FRANCES HE CONTINUED IS THE SOLE SURVIVOR OF THE DIRECT
FAMILY OF THE LATE EARL OF RUFTON THE ESTATES WENT AS YOU MAY
REMEMBER IN THE MALE LINE SHE WAS LEFT WITH LIMITED MEANS BUT WITH
SOME VERY REMARKABLE OLD SPANISH JEWELLERY OF SILVER AND CURIOUSLY
CUT DIAMONDS TO WHICH SHE WAS FONDLY ATTACHEDTOO ATTACHED FOR SHE
REFUSED TO LEAVE THEM WITH HER BANKER AND ALWAYS CARRIED THEM ABOUT
WITH HER A RATHER PATHETIC FIGURE THE LADY FRANCES A BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN STILL IN FRESH MIDDLE AGE AND YET BY A STRANGE CHANGE THE
LAST DERELICT OF WHAT ONLY TWENTY YEARS AGO WAS A GOODLY FLEET
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO HER THEN
AH WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE LADY FRANCES IS SHE ALIVE OR DEAD
THERE IS OUR PROBLEM SHE IS A LADY OF PRECISE HABITS AND FOR FOUR
YEARS IT HAS BEEN HER INVARIABLE CUSTOM TO WRITE EVERY SECOND WEEK TO
MISS DOBNEY HER OLD GOVERNESS WHO HAS LONG RETIRED AND LIVES IN
CAMBERWELL IT IS THIS MISS DOBNEY WHO HAS CONSULTED ME NEARLY FIVE
WEEKS HAVE PASSED WITHOUT A WORD THE LAST LETTER WAS FROM THE HOTEL
NATIONAL AT LAUSANNE LADY FRANCES SEEMS TO HAVE LEFT THERE AND GIVEN
NO ADDRESS THE FAMILY ARE ANXIOUS AND AS THEY ARE EXCEEDINGLY
WEALTHY NO SUM WILL BE SPARED IF WE CAN CLEAR THE MATTER UP
IS MISS DOBNEY THE ONLY SOURCE OF INFORMATION SURELY SHE HAD OTHER
CORRESPONDENTS
THERE IS ONE CORRESPONDENT WHO IS A SURE DRAW WATSON THAT IS THE
BANK SINGLE LADIES MUST LIVE AND THEIR PASSBOOKS ARE COMPRESSED
DIARIES SHE BANKS AT SILVESTERS I HAVE GLANCED OVER HER ACCOUNT
THE LAST CHECK BUT ONE PAID HER BILL AT LAUSANNE BUT IT WAS A LARGE
ONE AND PROBABLY LEFT HER WITH CASH IN HAND ONLY ONE CHECK HAS BEEN
DRAWN SINCE
TO WHOM AND WHERE
TO MISS MARIE DEVINE THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW WHERE THE CHECK WAS
DRAWN IT WAS CASHED AT THE CREDIT LYONNAIS AT MONTPELLIER LESS THAN
THREE WEEKS AGO THE SUM WAS FIFTY POUNDS
AND WHO IS MISS MARIE DEVINE
THAT ALSO I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER MISS MARIE DEVINE WAS THE
MAID OF LADY FRANCES CARFAX WHY SHE SHOULD HAVE PAID HER THIS CHECK
WE HAVE NOT YET DETERMINED I HAVE NO DOUBT HOWEVER THAT YOUR
RESEARCHES WILL SOON CLEAR THE MATTER UP
MY RESEARCHES
HENCE THE HEALTHGIVING EXPEDITION TO LAUSANNE YOU KNOW THAT I
CANNOT POSSIBLY LEAVE LONDON WHILE OLD ABRAHAMS IS IN SUCH MORTAL
TERROR OF HIS LIFE BESIDES ON GENERAL PRINCIPLES IT IS BEST THAT I
SHOULD NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY SCOTLAND YARD FEELS LONELY WITHOUT ME
AND IT CAUSES AN UNHEALTHY EXCITEMENT AMONG THE CRIMINAL CLASSES GO
THEN MY DEAR WATSON AND IF MY HUMBLE COUNSEL CAN EVER BE VALUED AT
SO EXTRAVAGANT A RATE AS TWO PENCE A WORD IT WAITS YOUR DISPOSAL
NIGHT AND DAY AT THE END OF THE CONTINENTAL WIRE
TWO DAYS LATER FOUND ME AT THE HOTEL NATIONAL AT LAUSANNE WHERE I
RECEIVED EVERY COURTESY AT THE HANDS OF M MOSER THE WELLKNOWN
MANAGER LADY FRANCES AS HE INFORMED ME HAD STAYED THERE FOR
SEVERAL WEEKS SHE HAD BEEN MUCH LIKED BY ALL WHO MET HER HER AGE
WAS NOT MORE THAN FORTY SHE WAS STILL HANDSOME AND BORE EVERY SIGN
OF HAVING IN HER YOUTH BEEN A VERY LOVELY WOMAN M MOSER KNEW
NOTHING OF ANY VALUABLE JEWELLERY BUT IT HAD BEEN REMARKED BY THE
SERVANTS THAT THE HEAVY TRUNK IN THE LADYS BEDROOM WAS ALWAYS
SCRUPULOUSLY LOCKED MARIE DEVINE THE MAID WAS AS POPULAR AS HER
MISTRESS SHE WAS ACTUALLY ENGAGED TO ONE OF THE HEAD WAITERS IN THE
HOTEL AND THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING HER ADDRESS IT WAS RUE DE
TRAJAN MONTPELLIER ALL THIS I JOTTED DOWN AND FELT THAT
HOLMES HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ADROIT IN COLLECTING HIS
FACTS
ONLY ONE CORNER STILL REMAINED IN THE SHADOW NO LIGHT WHICH I
POSSESSED COULD CLEAR UP THE CAUSE FOR THE LADYS SUDDEN DEPARTURE
SHE WAS VERY HAPPY AT LAUSANNE THERE WAS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT SHE INTENDED TO REMAIN FOR THE SEASON IN HER LUXURIOUS ROOMS
OVERLOOKING THE LAKE AND YET SHE HAD LEFT AT A SINGLE DAYS NOTICE
WHICH INVOLVED HER IN THE USELESS PAYMENT OF A WEEKS RENT ONLY
JULES VIBART THE LOVER OF THE MAID HAD ANY SUGGESTION TO OFFER HE
CONNECTED THE SUDDEN DEPARTURE WITH THE VISIT TO THE HOTEL A DAY OR
TWO BEFORE OF A TALL DARK BEARDED MAN UN SAUVAGEUN VRITABLE
SAUVAGE CRIED JULES VIBART THE MAN HAD ROOMS SOMEWHERE IN THE
TOWN HE HAD BEEN SEEN TALKING EARNESTLY TO MADAME ON THE PROMENADE
BY THE LAKE THEN HE HAD CALLED SHE HAD REFUSED TO SEE HIM HE WAS
ENGLISH BUT OF HIS NAME THERE WAS NO RECORD MADAME HAD LEFT THE
PLACE IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS JULES VIBART AND WHAT WAS OF MORE
IMPORTANCE JULES VIBARTS SWEETHEART THOUGHT THAT THIS CALL AND THE
DEPARTURE WERE CAUSE AND EFFECT ONLY ONE THING JULES WOULD NOT
DISCUSS THAT WAS THE REASON WHY MARIE HAD LEFT HER MISTRESS OF THAT
HE COULD OR WOULD SAY NOTHING IF I WISHED TO KNOW I MUST GO TO
MONTPELLIER AND ASK HER
SO ENDED THE FIRST CHAPTER OF MY INQUIRY THE SECOND WAS DEVOTED TO
THE PLACE WHICH LADY FRANCES CARFAX HAD SOUGHT WHEN SHE LEFT
LAUSANNE CONCERNING THIS THERE HAD BEEN SOME SECRECY WHICH
CONFIRMED THE IDEA THAT SHE HAD GONE WITH THE INTENTION OF THROWING
SOMEONE OFF HER TRACK OTHERWISE WHY SHOULD NOT HER LUGGAGE HAVE BEEN
OPENLY LABELLED FOR BADEN BOTH SHE AND IT REACHED THE RHENISH SPA BY
SOME CIRCUITOUS ROUTE THIS MUCH I GATHERED FROM THE MANAGER OF
COOKS LOCAL OFFICE SO TO BADEN I WENT AFTER DISPATCHING TO HOLMES
AN ACCOUNT OF ALL MY PROCEEDINGS AND RECEIVING IN REPLY A TELEGRAM OF
HALFHUMOROUS COMMENDATION
AT BADEN THE TRACK WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW LADY FRANCES HAD
STAYED AT THE ENGLISCHER HOF FOR A FORTNIGHT WHILE THERE SHE HAD
MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A DR SHLESSINGER AND HIS WIFE A MISSIONARY
FROM SOUTH AMERICA LIKE MOST LONELY LADIES LADY FRANCES FOUND HER
COMFORT AND OCCUPATION IN RELIGION DR SHLESSINGERS REMARKABLE
PERSONALITY HIS WHOLE HEARTED DEVOTION AND THE FACT THAT HE WAS
RECOVERING FROM A DISEASE CONTRACTED IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS APOSTOLIC
DUTIES AFFECTED HER DEEPLY SHE HAD HELPED MRS SHLESSINGER IN THE
NURSING OF THE CONVALESCENT SAINT HE SPENT HIS DAY AS THE MANAGER
DESCRIBED IT TO ME UPON A LOUNGECHAIR ON THE VERANDA WITH AN
ATTENDANT LADY UPON EITHER SIDE OF HIM HE WAS PREPARING A MAP OF THE
HOLY LAND WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE KINGDOM OF THE MIDIANITES
UPON WHICH HE WAS WRITING A MONOGRAPH FINALLY HAVING IMPROVED MUCH
IN HEALTH HE AND HIS WIFE HAD RETURNED TO LONDON AND LADY FRANCES
HAD STARTED THITHER IN THEIR COMPANY THIS WAS JUST THREE WEEKS
BEFORE AND THE MANAGER HAD HEARD NOTHING SINCE AS TO THE MAID
MARIE SHE HAD GONE OFF SOME DAYS BEFOREHAND IN FLOODS OF TEARS
AFTER INFORMING THE OTHER MAIDS THAT SHE WAS LEAVING SERVICE FOREVER
DR SHLESSINGER HAD PAID THE BILL OF THE WHOLE PARTY BEFORE HIS
DEPARTURE
BY THE WAY SAID THE LANDLORD IN CONCLUSION YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY
FRIEND OF LADY FRANCES CARFAX WHO IS INQUIRING AFTER HER JUST NOW
ONLY A WEEK OR SO AGO WE HAD A MAN HERE UPON THE SAME ERRAND
DID HE GIVE A NAME I ASKED
NONE BUT HE WAS AN ENGLISHMAN THOUGH OF AN UNUSUAL TYPE
A SAVAGE SAID I LINKING MY FACTS AFTER THE FASHION OF MY
ILLUSTRIOUS FRIEND
EXACTLY THAT DESCRIBES HIM VERY WELL HE IS A BULKY BEARDED
SUNBURNED FELLOW WHO LOOKS AS IF HE WOULD BE MORE AT HOME IN A
FARMERS INN THAN IN A FASHIONABLE HOTEL A HARD FIERCE MAN I
SHOULD THINK AND ONE WHOM I SHOULD BE SORRY TO OFFEND
ALREADY THE MYSTERY BEGAN TO DEFINE ITSELF AS FIGURES GROW CLEARER
WITH THE LIFTING OF A FOG HERE WAS THIS GOOD AND PIOUS LADY PURSUED
FROM PLACE TO PLACE BY A SINISTER AND UNRELENTING FIGURE SHE FEARED
HIM OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FLED FROM LAUSANNE HE HAD STILL FOLLOWED
SOONER OR LATER HE WOULD OVERTAKE HER HAD HE ALREADY OVERTAKEN HER
WAS THAT THE SECRET OF HER CONTINUED SILENCE COULD THE GOOD PEOPLE
WHO WERE HER COMPANIONS NOT SCREEN HER FROM HIS VIOLENCE OR HIS
BLACKMAIL WHAT HORRIBLE PURPOSE WHAT DEEP DESIGN LAY BEHIND THIS
LONG PURSUIT THERE WAS THE PROBLEM WHICH I HAD TO SOLVE
TO HOLMES I WROTE SHOWING HOW RAPIDLY AND SURELY I HAD GOT DOWN TO
THE ROOTS OF THE MATTER IN REPLY I HAD A TELEGRAM ASKING FOR A
DESCRIPTION OF DR SHLESSINGERS LEFT EAR HOLMESS IDEAS OF HUMOUR
ARE STRANGE AND OCCASIONALLY OFFENSIVE SO I TOOK NO NOTICE OF HIS
ILLTIMED JESTINDEED I HAD ALREADY REACHED MONTPELLIER IN MY
PURSUIT OF THE MAID MARIE BEFORE HIS MESSAGE CAME
I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE EXSERVANT AND IN LEARNING ALL
THAT SHE COULD TELL ME SHE WAS A DEVOTED CREATURE WHO HAD ONLY LEFT
HER MISTRESS BECAUSE SHE WAS SURE THAT SHE WAS IN GOOD HANDS AND
BECAUSE HER OWN APPROACHING MARRIAGE MADE A SEPARATION INEVITABLE IN
ANY CASE HER MISTRESS HAD AS SHE CONFESSED WITH DISTRESS SHOWN
SOME IRRITABILITY OF TEMPER TOWARDS HER DURING THEIR STAY IN BADEN
AND HAD EVEN QUESTIONED HER ONCE AS IF SHE HAD SUSPICIONS OF HER
HONESTY AND THIS HAD MADE THE PARTING EASIER THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE
HAVE BEEN LADY FRANCES HAD GIVEN HER FIFTY POUNDS AS A
WEDDINGPRESENT LIKE ME MARIE VIEWED WITH DEEP DISTRUST THE
STRANGER WHO HAD DRIVEN HER MISTRESS FROM LAUSANNE WITH HER OWN EYES
SHE HAD SEEN HIM SEIZE THE LADYS WRIST WITH GREAT VIOLENCE ON THE
PUBLIC PROMENADE BY THE LAKE HE WAS A FIERCE AND TERRIBLE MAN SHE
BELIEVED THAT IT WAS OUT OF DREAD OF HIM THAT LADY FRANCES HAD
ACCEPTED THE ESCORT OF THE SHLESSINGERS TO LONDON SHE HAD NEVER
SPOKEN TO MARIE ABOUT IT BUT MANY LITTLE SIGNS HAD CONVINCED THE
MAID THAT HER MISTRESS LIVED IN A STATE OF CONTINUAL NERVOUS
APPREHENSION SO FAR SHE HAD GOT IN HER NARRATIVE WHEN SUDDENLY SHE
SPRANG FROM HER CHAIR AND HER FACE WAS CONVULSED WITH SURPRISE AND
FEAR SEE SHE CRIED THE MISCREANT FOLLOWS STILL THERE IS THE
VERY MAN OF WHOM I SPEAK
THROUGH THE OPEN SITTINGROOM WINDOW I SAW A HUGE SWARTHY MAN WITH A
BRISTLING BLACK BEARD WALKING SLOWLY DOWN THE CENTRE OF THE STREET
AND STARING EAGERLY AT HE NUMBERS OF THE HOUSES IT WAS CLEAR THAT
LIKE MYSELF HE WAS ON THE TRACK OF THE MAID ACTING UPON THE IMPULSE
OF THE MOMENT I RUSHED OUT AND ACCOSTED HIM
YOU ARE AN ENGLISHMAN I SAID
WHAT IF I AM HE ASKED WITH A MOST VILLAINOUS SCOWL
MAY I ASK WHAT YOUR NAME IS
NO YOU MAY NOT SAID HE WITH DECISION
THE SITUATION WAS AWKWARD BUT THE MOST DIRECT WAY IS OFTEN THE BEST
WHERE IS THE LADY FRANCES CARFAX I ASKED
HE STARED AT ME WITH AMAZEMENT
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HER WHY HAVE YOU PURSUED HER I INSIST UPON
AN ANSWER SAID I
THE FELLOW GAVE A BELOW OF ANGER AND SPRANG UPON ME LIKE A TIGER I
HAVE HELD MY OWN IN MANY A STRUGGLE BUT THE MAN HAD A GRIP OF IRON
AND THE FURY OF A FIEND HIS HAND WAS ON MY THROAT AND MY SENSES WERE
NEARLY GONE BEFORE AN UNSHAVEN FRENCH OUVRIER IN A BLUE BLOUSE DARTED
OUT FROM A CABARET OPPOSITE WITH A CUDGEL IN HIS HAND AND STRUCK MY
ASSAILANT A SHARP CRACK OVER THE FOREARM WHICH MADE HIM LEAVE GO HIS
HOLD HE STOOD FOR AN INSTANT FUMING WITH RAGE AND UNCERTAIN WHETHER
HE SHOULD NOT RENEW HIS ATTACK THEN WITH A SNARL OF ANGER HE LEFT
ME AND ENTERED THE COTTAGE FROM WHICH I HAD JUST COME I TURNED TO
THANK MY PRESERVER WHO STOOD BESIDE ME IN THE ROADWAY
WELL WATSON SAID HE A VERY PRETTY HASH YOU HAVE MADE OF IT I
RATHER THINK YOU HAD BETTER COME BACK WITH ME TO LONDON BY THE NIGHT
EXPRESS
AN HOUR AFTERWARDS SHERLOCK HOLMES IN HIS USUAL GARB AND STYLE WAS
SEATED IN MY PRIVATE ROOM AT THE HOTEL HIS EXPLANATION OF HIS SUDDEN
AND OPPORTUNE APPEARANCE WAS SIMPLICITY ITSELF FOR FINDING THAT HE
COULD GET AWAY FROM LONDON HE DETERMINED TO HEAD ME OFF AT THE NEXT
OBVIOUS POINT OF MY TRAVELS IN THE DISGUISE OF A WORKINGMAN HE HAD
SAT IN THE CABARET WAITING FOR MY APPEARANCE
AND A SINGULARLY CONSISTENT INVESTIGATION YOU HAVE MADE MY DEAR
WATSON SAID HE I CANNOT AT THE MOMENT RECALL ANY POSSIBLE BLUNDER
WHICH YOU HAVE OMITTED THE TOTAL EFFECT OF YOUR PROCEEDING HAS BEEN
TO GIVE THE ALARM EVERYWHERE AND YET TO DISCOVER NOTHING
PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE DONE NO BETTER I ANSWERED BITTERLY
THERE IS NO PERHAPS ABOUT IT I HAVE DONE BETTER HERE IS THE HON
PHILIP GREEN WHO IS A FELLOWLODGER WITH YOU IN THIS HOTEL AND WE
MAY FIND HIM THE STARTINGPOINT FOR A MORE SUCCESSFUL INVESTIGATION
A CARD HAD COME UP ON A SALVER AND IT WAS FOLLOWED BY THE SAME
BEARDED RUFFIAN WHO HAD ATTACKED ME IN THE STREET HE STARTED WHEN HE
SAW ME
WHAT IS THIS MR HOLMES HE ASKED I HAD YOUR NOTE AND I HAVE
COME BUT WHAT HAS THIS MAN TO DO WITH THE MATTER
THIS IS MY OLD FRIEND AND ASSOCIATE DR WATSON WHO IS HELPING US
IN THIS AFFAIR
THE STRANGER HELD OUT A HUGE SUNBURNED HAND WITH A FEW WORDS OF
APOLOGY
I HOPE I DIDNT HARM YOU WHEN YOU ACCUSED ME OF HURTING HER I LOST
MY GRIP OF MYSELF INDEED IM NOT RESPONSIBLE IN THESE DAYS MY
NERVES ARE LIKE LIVE WIRES BUT THIS SITUATION IS BEYOND ME WHAT I
WANT TO KNOW IN THE FIRST PLACE MR HOLMES IS HOW IN THE WORLD
YOU CAME TO HEAR OF MY EXISTENCE AT ALL
I AM IN TOUCH WITH MISS DOBNEY LADY FRANCESS GOVERNESS
OLD SUSAN DOBNEY WITH THE MOB CAP I REMEMBER HER WELL
AND SHE REMEMBERS YOU IT WAS IN THE DAYS BEFOREBEFORE YOU FOUND
IT BETTER TO GO TO SOUTH AFRICA
AH I SEE YOU KNOW MY WHOLE STORY I NEED HIDE NOTHING FROM YOU I
SWEAR TO YOU MR HOLMES THAT THERE NEVER WAS IN THIS WORLD A MAN
WHO LOVED A WOMAN WITH A MORE WHOLEHEARTED LOVE THAN I HAD FOR
FRANCES I WAS A WILD YOUNGSTER I KNOWNOT WORSE THAN OTHERS OF MY
CLASS BUT HER MIND WAS PURE AS SNOW SHE COULD NOT BEAR A SHADOW OF
COARSENESS SO WHEN SHE CAME TO HEAR OF THINGS THAT I HAD DONE SHE
WOULD HAVE NO MORE TO SAY TO ME AND YET SHE LOVED METHAT IS THE
WONDER OF ITLOVED ME WELL ENOUGH TO REMAIN SINGLE ALL HER SAINTED
DAYS JUST FOR MY SAKE ALONE WHEN THE YEARS HAD PASSED AND I HAD MADE
MY MONEY AT BARBERTON I THOUGHT PERHAPS I COULD SEEK HER OUT AND
SOFTEN HER I HAD HEARD THAT SHE WAS STILL UNMARRIED I FOUND HER AT
LAUSANNE AND TRIED ALL I KNEW SHE WEAKENED I THINK BUT HER WILL
WAS STRONG AND WHEN NEXT I CALLED SHE HAD LEFT THE TOWN I TRACED
HER TO BADEN AND THEN AFTER A TIME HEARD THAT HER MAID WAS HERE IM
A ROUGH FELLOW FRESH FROM A ROUGH LIFE AND WHEN DR WATSON SPOKE TO
ME AS HE DID I LOST HOLD OF MYSELF FOR A MOMENT BUT FOR GODS SAKE
TELL ME WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE LADY FRANCES
THAT IS FOR US TO FIND OUT SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES WITH PECULIAR
GRAVITY WHAT IS YOUR LONDON ADDRESS MR GREEN
THE LANGHAM HOTEL WILL FIND ME
THEN MAY I RECOMMEND THAT YOU RETURN THERE AND BE ON HAND IN CASE I
SHOULD WANT YOU I HAVE NO DESIRE TO ENCOURAGE FALSE HOPES BUT YOU
MAY REST ASSURED THAT ALL THAT CAN BE DONE WILL BE DONE FOR THE
SAFETY OF LADY FRANCES I CAN SAY NO MORE FOR THE INSTANT I WILL
LEAVE YOU THIS CARD SO THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH US
NOW WATSON IF YOU WILL PACK YOUR BAG I WILL CABLE TO MRS HUDSON TO
MAKE ONE OF HER BEST EFFORTS FOR TWO HUNGRY TRAVELLERS AT TOMORROW
A TELEGRAM WAS AWAITING US WHEN WE REACHED OUR BAKER STREET ROOMS
WHICH HOLMES READ WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF INTEREST AND THREW ACROSS TO
ME JAGGED OR TORN WAS THE MESSAGE AND THE PLACE OF ORIGIN
BADEN
WHAT IS THIS I ASKED
IT IS EVERYTHING HOLMES ANSWERED YOU MAY REMEMBER MY SEEMINGLY
IRRELEVANT QUESTION AS TO THIS CLERICAL GENTLEMANS LEFT EAR YOU DID
NOT ANSWER IT
I HAD LEFT BADEN AND COULD NOT INQUIRE
EXACTLY FOR THIS REASON I SENT A DUPLICATE TO THE MANAGER OF THE
ENGLISCHER HOF WHOSE ANSWER LIES HERE
WHAT DOES IT SHOW
IT SHOWS MY DEAR WATSON THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH AN EXCEPTIONALLY
ASTUTE AND DANGEROUS MAN THE REV DR SHLESSINGER MISSIONARY FROM
SOUTH AMERICA IS NONE OTHER THAN HOLY PETERS ONE OF THE MOST
UNSCRUPULOUS RASCALS THAT AUSTRALIA HAS EVER EVOLVEDAND FOR A YOUNG
COUNTRY IT HAS TURNED OUT SOME VERY FINISHED TYPES HIS PARTICULAR
SPECIALTY IS THE BEGUILING OF LONELY LADIES BY PLAYING UPON THEIR
RELIGIOUS FEELINGS AND HIS SOCALLED WIFE AN ENGLISHWOMAN NAMED
FRASER IS A WORTHY HELPMATE THE NATURE OF HIS TACTICS SUGGESTED HIS
IDENTITY TO ME AND THIS PHYSICAL PECULIARITYHE WAS BADLY BITTEN IN
A SALOONFIGHT AT ADELAIDE IN CONFIRMED MY SUSPICION THIS POOR
LADY IS IN THE HANDS OF A MOST INFERNAL COUPLE WHO WILL STICK AT
NOTHING WATSON THAT SHE IS ALREADY DEAD IS A VERY LIKELY
SUPPOSITION IF NOT SHE IS UNDOUBTEDLY IN SOME SORT OF CONFINEMENT
AND UNABLE TO WRITE TO MISS DOBNEY OR HER OTHER FRIENDS IT IS ALWAYS
POSSIBLE THAT SHE NEVER REACHED LONDON OR THAT SHE HAS PASSED
THROUGH IT BUT THE FORMER IS IMPROBABLE AS WITH THEIR SYSTEM OF
REGISTRATION IT IS NOT EASY FOR FOREIGNERS TO PLAY TRICKS WITH THE
CONTINENTAL POLICE AND THE LATTER IS ALSO UNLIKELY AS THESE ROUGES
COULD NOT HOPE TO FIND ANY OTHER PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE AS EASY TO
KEEP A PERSON UNDER RESTRAINT ALL MY INSTINCTS TELL ME THAT SHE IS
IN LONDON BUT AS WE HAVE AT PRESENT NO POSSIBLE MEANS OF TELLING
WHERE WE CAN ONLY TAKE THE OBVIOUS STEPS EAT OUR DINNER AND
POSSESS OUR SOULS IN PATIENCE LATER IN THE EVENING I WILL STROLL
DOWN AND HAVE A WORD WITH FRIEND LESTRADE AT SCOTLAND YARD
BUT NEITHER THE OFFICIAL POLICE NOR HOLMESS OWN SMALL BUT VERY
EFFICIENT ORGANIZATION SUFFICED TO CLEAR AWAY THE MYSTERY AMID THE
CROWDED MILLIONS OF LONDON THE THREE PERSONS WE SOUGHT WERE AS
COMPLETELY OBLITERATED AS IF THEY HAD NEVER LIVED ADVERTISEMENTS
WERE TRIED AND FAILED CLUES WERE FOLLOWED AND LED TO NOTHING
EVERY CRIMINAL RESORT WHICH SHLESSINGER MIGHT FREQUENT WAS DRAWN IN
VAIN HIS OLD ASSOCIATES WERE WATCHED BUT THEY KEPT CLEAR OF HIM
AND THEN SUDDENLY AFTER A WEEK OF HELPLESS SUSPENSE THERE CAME A
FLASH OF LIGHT A SILVERANDBRILLIANT PENDANT OF OLD SPANISH DESIGN
HAD BEEN PAWNED AT BOVINGTONS IN WESTMINSTER ROAD THE PAWNER WAS A
LARGE CLEANSHAVEN MAN OF CLERICAL APPEARANCE HIS NAME AND ADDRESS
WERE DEMONSTRABLY FALSE THE EAR HAD ESCAPED NOTICE BUT THE
DESCRIPTION WAS SURELY THAT OF SHLESSINGER
THREE TIMES HAD OUR BEARDED FRIEND FROM THE LANGHAM CALLED FOR
NEWSTHE THIRD TIME WITHIN AN HOUR OF THIS FRESH DEVELOPMENT HIS
CLOTHES WERE GETTING LOOSER ON HIS GREAT BODY HE SEEMED TO BE
WILTING AWAY IN HIS ANXIETY IF YOU WILL ONLY GIVE ME SOMETHING TO
DO WAS HIS CONSTANT WAIL AT LAST HOLMES COULD OBLIGE HIM
HE HAS BEGUN TO PAWN THE JEWELS WE SHOULD GET HIM NOW
BUT DOES THIS MEAN THAT ANY HARM HAS BEFALLEN THE LADY FRANCES
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD VERY GRAVELY
SUPPOSING THAT THEY HAVE HELD HER PRISONER UP TO NOW IT IS CLEAR
THAT THEY CANNOT LET HER LOOSE WITHOUT THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION WE MUST
PREPARE FOR THE WORST
WHAT CAN I DO
THESE PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW YOU BY SIGHT
NO
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE WILL GO TO SOME OTHER PAWNBROKER IN THE
FUTURE IN THAT CASE WE MUST BEGIN AGAIN ON THE OTHER HAND HE HAS
HAD A FAIR PRICE AND NO QUESTIONS ASKED SO IF HE IS IN NEED OF
READYMONEY HE WILL PROBABLY COME BACK TO BOVINGTONS I WILL GIVE
YOU A NOTE TO THEM AND THEY WILL LET YOU WAIT IN THE SHOP IF THE
FELLOW COMES YOU WILL FOLLOW HIM HOME BUT NO INDISCRETION AND
ABOVE ALL NO VIOLENCE I PUT YOU ON YOUR HONOUR THAT YOU WILL TAKE
NO STEP WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT
FOR TWO DAYS THE HON PHILIP GREEN HE WAS I MAY MENTION THE SON OF
THE FAMOUS ADMIRAL OF THAT NAME WHO COMMANDED THE SEA OF AZOF FLEET
IN THE CRIMEAN WAR BROUGHT US NO NEWS ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD
HE RUSHED INTO OUR SITTINGROOM PALE TREMBLING WITH EVERY MUSCLE
OF HIS POWERFUL FRAME QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
WE HAVE HIM WE HAVE HIM HE CRIED
HE WAS INCOHERENT IN HIS AGITATION HOLMES SOOTHED HIM WITH A FEW
WORDS AND THRUST HIM INTO AN ARMCHAIR
COME NOW GIVE US THE ORDER OF EVENTS SAID HE
SHE CAME ONLY AN HOUR AGO IT WAS THE WIFE THIS TIME BUT THE
PENDANT SHE BROUGHT WAS THE FELLOW OF THE OTHER SHE IS A TALL PALE
WOMAN WITH FERRET EYES
THAT IS THE LADY SAID HOLMES
SHE LEFT THE OFFICE AND I FOLLOWED HER SHE WALKED UP THE KENNINGTON
ROAD AND I KEPT BEHIND HER PRESENTLY SHE WENT INTO A SHOP MR
HOLMES IT WAS AN UNDERTAKERS
MY COMPANION STARTED WELL HE ASKED IN THAT VIBRANT VOICE WHICH
TOLD OF THE FIERY SOUL BEHIND THE COLD GRAY FACE
SHE WAS TALKING TO THE WOMAN BEHIND THE COUNTER I ENTERED AS WELL
IT IS LATE I HEARD HER SAY OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT THE WOMAN WAS
EXCUSING HERSELF IT SHOULD BE THERE BEFORE NOW SHE ANSWERED IT
TOOK LONGER BEING OUT OF THE ORDINARY THEY BOTH STOPPED AND LOOKED
AT ME SO I ASKED SOME QUESTIONS AND THEN LEFT THE SHOP
YOU DID EXCELLENTLY WELL WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
THE WOMAN CAME OUT BUT I HAD HID MYSELF IN A DOORWAY HER
SUSPICIONS HAD BEEN AROUSED I THINK FOR SHE LOOKED ROUND HER THEN
SHE CALLED A CAB AND GOT IN I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET ANOTHER AND SO
TO FOLLOW HER SHE GOT DOWN AT LAST AT NO POULTNEY SQUARE
BRIXTON I DROVE PAST LEFT MY CAB AT THE CORNER OF THE SQUARE AND
WATCHED THE HOUSE
DID YOU SEE ANYONE
THE WINDOWS WERE ALL IN DARKNESS SAVE ONE ON THE LOWER FLOOR THE
BLIND WAS DOWN AND I COULD NOT SEE IN I WAS STANDING THERE
WONDERING WHAT I SHOULD DO NEXT WHEN A COVERED VAN DROVE UP WITH TWO
MEN IN IT THEY DESCENDED TOOK SOMETHING OUT OF THE VAN AND CARRIED
IT UP THE STEPS TO THE HALL DOOR MR HOLMES IT WAS A COFFIN
AH
FOR AN INSTANT I WAS ON THE POINT OF RUSHING IN THE DOOR HAD BEEN
OPENED TO ADMIT THE MEN AND THEIR BURDEN IT WAS THE WOMAN WHO HAD
OPENED IT BUT AS I STOOD THERE SHE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF ME AND I
THINK THAT SHE RECOGNIZED ME I SAW HER START AND SHE HASTILY CLOSED
THE DOOR I REMEMBERED MY PROMISE TO YOU AND HERE I AM
YOU HAVE DONE EXCELLENT WORK SAID HOLMES SCRIBBLING A FEW WORDS
UPON A HALFSHEET OF PAPER WE CAN DO NOTHING LEGAL WITHOUT A
WARRANT AND YOU CAN SERVE THE CAUSE BEST BY TAKING THIS NOTE DOWN TO
THE AUTHORITIES AND GETTING ONE THERE MAY BE SOME DIFFICULTY BUT I
SHOULD THINK THAT THE SALE OF THE JEWELLERY SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT
LESTRADE WILL SEE TO ALL DETAILS
BUT THEY MAY MURDER HER IN THE MEANWHILE WHAT COULD THE COFFIN
MEAN AND FOR WHOM COULD IT BE BUT FOR HER
WE WILL DO ALL THAT CAN BE DONE MR GREEN NOT A MOMENT WILL BE
LOST LEAVE IT IN OUR HANDS NOW WATSON HE ADDED AS OUR CLIENT
HURRIED AWAY HE WILL SET THE REGULAR FORCES ON THE MOVE WE ARE AS
USUAL THE IRREGULARS AND WE MUST TAKE OUR OWN LINE OF ACTION THE
SITUATION STRIKES ME AS SO DESPERATE THAT THE MOST EXTREME MEASURES
ARE JUSTIFIED NOT A MOMENT IS TO BE LOST IN GETTING TO POULTNEY
SQUARE
LET US TRY TO RECONSTRUCT THE SITUATION SAID HE AS WE DROVE
SWIFTLY PAST THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND OVER WESTMINSTER BRIDGE
THESE VILLAINS HAVE COAXED THIS UNHAPPY LADY TO LONDON AFTER FIRST
ALIENATING HER FROM HER FAITHFUL MAID IF SHE HAS WRITTEN ANY LETTERS
THEY HAVE BEEN INTERCEPTED THROUGH SOME CONFEDERATE THEY HAVE
ENGAGED A FURNISHED HOUSE ONCE INSIDE IT THEY HAVE MADE HER A
PRISONER AND THEY HAVE BECOME POSSESSED OF THE VALUABLE JEWELLERY
WHICH HAS BEEN THEIR OBJECT FROM THE FIRST ALREADY THEY HAVE BEGUN
TO SELL PART OF IT WHICH SEEMS SAFE ENOUGH TO THEM SINCE THEY HAVE
NO REASON TO THINK THAT ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN THE LADYS FATE WHEN
SHE IS RELEASED SHE WILL OF COURSE DENOUNCE THEM THEREFORE SHE
MUST NOT BE RELEASED BUT THEY CANNOT KEEP HER UNDER LOCK AND KEY
FOREVER SO MURDER IS THEIR ONLY SOLUTION
THAT SEEMS VERY CLEAR
NOW WE WILL TAKE ANOTHER LINE OF REASONING WHEN YOU FOLLOW TWO
SEPARATE CHAINS OF THOUGHT WATSON YOU WILL FIND SOME POINT OF
INTERSECTION WHICH SHOULD APPROXIMATE TO THE TRUTH WE WILL START
NOW NOT FROM THE LADY BUT FROM THE COFFIN AND ARGUE BACKWARD THAT
INCIDENT PROVES I FEAR BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT THE LADY IS DEAD IT
POINTS ALSO TO AN ORTHODOX BURIAL WITH PROPER ACCOMPANIMENT OF
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE AND OFFICIAL SANCTION HAD THE LADY BEEN
OBVIOUSLY MURDERED THEY WOULD HAVE BURIED HER IN A HOLE IN THE BACK
GARDEN BUT HERE ALL IS OPEN AND REGULAR WHAT DOES THIS MEAN SURELY
THAT THEY HAVE DONE HER TO DEATH IN SOME WAY WHICH HAS DECEIVED THE
DOCTOR AND SIMULATED A NATURAL ENDPOISONING PERHAPS AND YET HOW
STRANGE THAT THEY SHOULD EVER LET A DOCTOR APPROACH HER UNLESS HE
WERE A CONFEDERATE WHICH IS HARDLY A CREDIBLE PROPOSITION
COULD THEY HAVE FORGED A MEDICAL CERTIFICATE
DANGEROUS WATSON VERY DANGEROUS NO I HARDLY SEE THEM DOING THAT
PULL UP CABBY THIS IS EVIDENTLY THE UNDERTAKERS FOR WE HAVE JUST
PASSED THE PAWNBROKERS WOULD GO IN WATSON YOUR APPEARANCE
INSPIRES CONFIDENCE ASK WHAT HOUR THE POULTNEY SQUARE FUNERAL TAKES
PLACE TOMORROW
THE WOMAN IN THE SHOP ANSWERED ME WITHOUT HESITATION THAT IT WAS TO
BE AT EIGHT OCLOCK IN THE MORNING YOU SEE WATSON NO MYSTERY
EVERYTHING ABOVEBOARD IN SOME WAY THE LEGAL FORMS HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY
BEEN COMPLIED WITH AND THEY THINK THAT THEY HAVE LITTLE TO FEAR
WELL THERES NOTHING FOR IT NOW BUT A DIRECT FRONTAL ATTACK ARE YOU
ARMED
MY STICK
WELL WELL WE SHALL BE STRONG ENOUGH THRICE IS HE ARMED WHO HATH
HIS QUARREL JUST WE SIMPLY CANT AFFORD TO WAIT FOR THE POLICE OR
TO KEEP WITHIN THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE LAW YOU CAN DRIVE OFF CABBY
NOW WATSON WELL JUST TAKE OUR LUCK TOGETHER AS WE HAVE
OCCASIONALLY IN THE PAST
HE HAD RUNG LOUDLY AT THE DOOR OF A GREAT DARK HOUSE IN THE CENTRE OF
POULTNEY SQUARE IT WAS OPENED IMMEDIATELY AND THE FIGURE OF A TALL
WOMAN WAS OUTLINED AGAINST THE DIMLIT HALL
WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT SHE ASKED SHARPLY PEERING AT US THROUGH
THE DARKNESS
I WANT TO SPEAK TO DR SHLESSINGER SAID HOLMES
THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON HERE SHE ANSWERED AND TRIED TO CLOSE THE
DOOR BUT HOLMES HAD JAMMED IT WITH HIS FOOT
WELL I WANT TO SEE THE MAN WHO LIVES HERE WHATEVER HE MAY CALL
HIMSELF SAID HOLMES FIRMLY
SHE HESITATED THEN SHE THREW OPEN THE DOOR WELL COME IN SAID
SHE MY HUSBAND IS NOT AFRAID TO FACE ANY MAN IN THE WORLD SHE
CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND US AND SHOWED US INTO A SITTINGROOM ON THE
RIGHT SIDE OF THE HALL TURNING UP THE GAS AS SHE LEFT US MR
PETERS WILL BE WITH YOU IN AN INSTANT SHE SAID
HER WORDS WERE LITERALLY TRUE FOR WE HAD HARDLY TIME TO LOOK AROUND
THE DUSTY AND MOTHEATEN APARTMENT IN WHICH WE FOUND OURSELVES BEFORE
THE DOOR OPENED AND A BIG CLEANSHAVEN BALDHEADED MAN STEPPED
LIGHTLY INTO THE ROOM HE HAD A LARGE RED FACE WITH PENDULOUS
CHEEKS AND A GENERAL AIR OF SUPERFICIAL BENEVOLENCE WHICH WAS MARRED
BY A CRUEL VICIOUS MOUTH
THERE IS SURELY SOME MISTAKE HERE GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN AN
UNCTUOUS MAKEEVERYTHINGEASY VOICE I FANCY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN
MISDIRECTED POSSIBLY IF YOU TRIED FARTHER DOWN THE STREET
THAT WILL DO WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE SAID MY COMPANION FIRMLY

BADEN AND SOUTH AMERICA I AM AS SURE OF THAT AS THAT MY OWN NAME IS

I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH THE LADY FRANCES CARFAX WHOM

ID BE VERY GLAD IF YOU COULD TELL ME WHERE THAT LADY MAY BE
PETERS ANSWERED COOLLY IVE A BILL AGAINST HER FOR A NEARLY A
HUNDRED POUNDS AND NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT BUT A COUPLE OF TRUMPERY
PENDANTS THAT THE DEALER WOULD HARDLY LOOK AT SHE ATTACHED HERSELF
TO MRS PETERS AND ME AT BADENIT IS A FACT THAT I WAS USING ANOTHER
NAME AT THE TIMEAND SHE STUCK ON TO US UNTIL WE CAME TO LONDON I
PAID HER BILL AND HER TICKET ONCE IN LONDON SHE GAVE US THE SLIP

WAS BROUGHT INTO YOUR HOUSE

HOLMESS EXPRESSION WAS AS IMPASSIVE AS EVER UNDER THE JEERS OF HIS
ANTAGONIST BUT HIS CLENCHED HANDS BETRAYED HIS ACUTE ANNOYANCE

EXPECT A WARRANT PRESENTLY
THEN ILL KEEP MY EYE ON THE PARTIES MR HOLMES IF ANYTHING COMES
ALONG I WILL SURELY LET YOU KNOW
IT WAS ONLY NINE OCLOCK AND WE WERE OFF FULL CRY UPON THE TRAIL AT
ONCE FIRST WE DROVE TO BRIXTON WORKHOUSED INFIRMARY WHERE WE FOUND
THAT IT WAS INDEED THE TRUTH THAT A CHARITABLE COUPLE HAD CALLED SOME
DAYS BEFORE THAT THEY HAD CLAIMED AN IMBECILE OLD WOMAN AS A FORMER
SERVANT AND THAT THEY HAD OBTAINED PERMISSION TO TAKE HER AWAY WITH
THEM NO SURPRISE WAS EXPRESSED AT THE NEWS THAT SHE HAD SINCE DIED
THE DOCTOR WAS OUR NEXT GOAL HE HAD BEEN CALLED IN HAD FOUND THE
WOMAN DYING OF PURE SENILITY HAD ACTUALLY SEEN HER PASS AWAY AND
HAD SIGNED THE CERTIFICATE IN DUE FORM I ASSURE YOU THAT EVERYTHING
WAS PERFECTLY NORMAL AND THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR FOUL PLAY IN THE
MATTER SAID HE NOTHING IN THE HOUSE HAD STRUCK HIM AS SUSPICIOUS
SAVE THAT FOR PEOPLE OF THEIR CLASS IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT THEY
SHOULD HAVE NO SERVANT SO FAR AND NO FURTHER WENT THE DOCTOR
FINALLY WE FOUND OUR WAY TO SCOTLAND YARD THERE HAD BEEN
DIFFICULTIES OF PROCEDURE IN REGARD TO THE WARRANT SOME DELAY WAS
INEVITABLE THE MAGISTRATES SIGNATURE MIGHT NOT BE OBTAINED UNTIL
NEXT MORNING IF HOLMES WOULD CALL ABOUT NINE HE COULD GO DOWN WITH
LESTRADE AND SEE IT ACTED UPON SO ENDED THE DAY SAVE THAT NEAR
MIDNIGHT OUR FRIEND THE SERGEANT CALLED TO SAY THAT HE HAD SEEN
FLICKERING LIGHTS HERE AND THERE IN THE WINDOWS OF THE GREAT DARK
HOUSE BUT THAT NO ONE HAD LEFT IT AND NONE HAD ENTERED WE COULD BUT
PRAY FOR PATIENCE AND WAIT FOR THE MORROW
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS TOO IRRITABLE FOR CONVERSATION AND TOO RESTLESS
FOR SLEEP I LEFT HIM SMOKING HARD WITH HIS HEAVY DARK BROWS
KNOTTED TOGETHER AND HIS LONG NERVOUS FINGERS TAPPING UPON THE ARMS
OF HIS CHAIR AS HE TURNED OVER IN HIS MIND EVERY POSSIBLE SOLUTION
OF THE MYSTERY SEVERAL TIMES IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT I HEARD HIM
PROWLING ABOUT THE HOUSE FINALLY JUST AFTER I HAD BEEN CALLED IN
THE MORNING HE RUSHED INTO MY ROOM HE WAS IN HIS DRESSINGGOWN BUT
HIS PALE HOLLOWEYED FACE TOLD ME THAT HIS NIGHT HAD BEEN A
SLEEPLESS ONE
WHAT TIME WAS THE FUNERAL EIGHT WAS IT NOT HE ASKED EAGERLY
WELL IT IS NOW GOOD HEAVENS WATSON WHAT HAS BECOME OF ANY
BRAINS THAT GOD HAS GIVEN ME QUICK MAN QUICK ITS LIFE OR
DEATHA HUNDRED CHANCES ON DEATH TO ONE ON LIFE ILL NEVER FORGIVE
MYSELF NEVER IF WE ARE TOO LATE
FIVE MINUTES HAD NOT PASSED BEFORE WE WERE FLYING IN A HANSOM DOWN
BAKER STREET BUT EVEN SO IT WAS TWENTYFIVE TO EIGHT AS WE PASSED
BIG BEN AND EIGHT STRUCK AS WE TORE DOWN THE BRIXTON ROAD BUT
OTHERS WERE LATE AS WELL AS WE TEN MINUTES AFTER THE HOUR THE HEARSE
WAS STILL STANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND EVEN AS OUR FOAMING
HORSE CAME TO A HALT THE COFFIN SUPPORTED BY THREE MEN APPEARED ON
THE THRESHOLD HOLMES DARTED FORWARD AND BARRED THEIR WAY
TAKE IT BACK HE CRIED LAYING HIS HAND ON THE BREAST OF THE
FOREMOST TAKE IT BACK THIS INSTANT
WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU MEAN ONCE AGAIN I ASK YOU WHERE IS YOUR
WARRANT SHOUTED THE FURIOUS PETERS HIS BIG RED FACE GLARING OVER
THE FARTHER END OF THE COFFIN
THE WARRANT IS ON ITS WAY THE COFFIN SHALL REMAIN IN THE HOUSE
UNTIL IT COMES
THE AUTHORITY IN HOLMESS VOICE HAD ITS EFFECT UPON THE BEARERS
PETERS HAD SUDDENLY VANISHED INTO THE HOUSE AND THEY OBEYED THESE
NEW ORDERS QUICK WATSON QUICK HERE IS A SCREWDRIVER HE
SHOUTED AS THE COFFIN WAS REPLACED UPON THE TABLE HERES ONE FOR
YOU MY MAN A SOVREIGN IF THE LID COMES OFF IN A MINUTE ASK NO
QUESTIONSWORK AWAY THATS GOOD ANOTHER AND ANOTHER NOW PULL ALL
TOGETHER ITS GIVING ITS GIVING AH THAT DOES IT AT LAST
WITH A UNITED EFFORT WE TORE OFF THE COFFINLID AS WE DID SO THERE
CAME FROM THE INSIDE A STUPEFYING AND OVERPOWERING SMELL OF
CHLOROFORM A BODY LAY WITHIN ITS HEAD ALL WREATHED IN COTTONWOOL
WHICH HAD BEEN SOAKED IN THE NARCOTIC HOLMES PLUCKED IT OFF AND
DISCLOSED THE STATUESQUE FACE OF A HANDSOME AND SPIRITUAL WOMAN OF
MIDDLE AGE IN AN INSTANT HE HAD PASSED HIS ARM ROUND THE FIGURE AND
RAISED HER TO A SITTING POSITION
IS SHE GONE WATSON IS THERE A SPARK LEFT SURELY WE ARE NOT TOO
LATE
FOR HALF AN HOUR IT SEEMED THAT WE WERE WHAT WITH ACTUAL
SUFFOCATION AND WHAT WITH THE POISONOUS FUMES OF THE CHLOROFORM THE
LADY FRANCES SEEMED TO HAVE PASSED THE LAST POINT OF RECALL AND
THEN AT LAST WITH ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION WITH INJECTED ETHER AND
WITH EVERY DEVICE THAT SCIENCE COULD SUGGEST SOME FLUTTER OF LIFE
SOME QUIVER OF THE EYELIDS SOME DIMMING OF A MIRROR SPOKE OF THE
SLOWLY RETURNING LIFE A CAB HAD DRIVEN UP AND HOLMES PARTING THE
BLIND LOOKED OUT AT IT HERE IS LESTRADE WITH HIS WARRANT SAID
HE HE WILL FIND THAT HIS BIRDS HAVE FLOWN AND HERE HE ADDED AS A
HEAVY STEP HURRIED ALONG THE PASSAGE IS SOMEONE WHO HAS A BETTER
RIGHT TO NURSE THIS LADY THAN WE HAVE GOOD MORNING MR GREEN I
THINK THAT THE SOONER WE CAN MOVE THE LADY FRANCES THE BETTER
MEANWHILE THE FUNERAL MAY PROCEED AND THE POOR OLD WOMAN WHO STILL
LIES IN THAT COFFIN MAY GO TO HER LAST RESTINGPLACE ALONE
SHOULD YOU CARE TO ADD THE CASE TO YOUR ANNALS MY DEAR WATSON
SAID HOLMES THAT EVENING IT CAN ONLY BE AS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT
TEMPORARY ECLIPSE TO WHICH EVEN THE BESTBALANCED MIND MAY BE
EXPOSED SUCH SLIPS ARE COMMON TO ALL MORTALS AND THE GREATEST IS HE
WHO CAN RECOGNIZE AND REPAIR THEM TO THIS MODIFIED CREDIT I MAY
PERHAPS MAKE SOME CLAIM MY NIGHT WAS HAUNTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT
SOMEWHERE A CLUE A STRANGE SENTENCE A CURIOUS OBSERVATION HAD COME
UNDER MY NOTICE AND HAD BEEN TOO EASILY DISMISSED THEN SUDDENLY IN
THE GRAY OF THE MORNING THE WORDS CAME BACK TO ME IT WAS THE REMARK
OF THE UNDERTAKERS WIFE AS REPORTED BY PHILIP GREEN SHE HAD SAID
IT SHOULD BE THERE BEFORE NOW IT TOOK LONGER BEING OUT OF THE
ORDINARY IT WAS THE COFFIN OF WHICH SHE SPOKE IT HAD BEEN OUT OF
THE ORDINARY THAT COULD ONLY MEAN THAT IT HAD BEEN MADE TO SOME
SPECIAL MEASUREMENT BUT WHY WHY THEN IN AN INSTANT I REMEMBERED
THE DEEP SIDES AND THE LITTLE WASTED FIGURE AT THE BOTTOM WHY SO
LARGE A COFFIN FOR SO SMALL A BODY TO LEAVE ROOM FOR ANOTHER BODY
BOTH WOULD BE BURIED UNDER THE ONE CERTIFICATE IT HAD ALL BEEN SO
CLEAR IF ONLY MY OWN SIGHT HAD NOT BEEN DIMMED AT EIGHT THE LADY
FRANCES WOULD BE BURIED OUR ONE CHANCE WAS TO STOP THE COFFIN BEFORE
IT LEFT THE HOUSE
IT WAS A DESPERATE CHANCE THAT WE MIGHT FIND HER ALIVE BUT IT WAS A
CHANCE AS THE RESULT SHOWED THESE PEOPLE HAD NEVER TO MY
KNOWLEDGE DONE A MURDER THEY MIGHT SHRINK FROM ACTUAL VIOLENCE AT
THE LAST THE COULD BURY HER WITH NO SIGN OF HOW SHE MET HER END AND
EVEN IF SHE WERE EXHUMED THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR THEM I HOPED THAT
SUCH CONSIDERATIONS MIGHT PREVAIL WITH THEM YOU CAN RECONSTRUCT THE
SCENE WELL ENOUGH YOU SAW THE HORRIBLE DEN UPSTAIRS WHERE THE POOR
LADY HAD BEEN KEPT SO LONG THEY RUSHED IN AND OVERPOWERED HER WITH
THEIR CHLOROFORM CARRIED HER DOWN POURED MORE INTO THE COFFIN TO
INSURE AGAINST HER WAKING AND THEN SCREWED DOWN THE LID A CLEVER
DEVICE WATSON IT IS NEW TO ME IN THE ANNALS OF CRIME IF OUR
EXMISSIONARY FRIENDS ESCAPE THE CLUTCHES OF LESTRADE I SHALL EXPECT
TO HEAR OF SOME BRILLIANT INCIDENTS IN THEIR FUTURE CAREER
THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVILS FOOT
IN RECORDING FROM TIME TO TIME SOME OF THE CURIOUS EXPERIENCES AND
INTERESTING RECOLLECTIONS WHICH I ASSOCIATE WITH MY LONG AND INTIMATE
FRIENDSHIP WITH MR SHERLOCK HOLMES I HAVE CONTINUALLY BEEN FACED BY
DIFFICULTIES CAUSED BY HIS OWN AVERSION TO PUBLICITY TO HIS SOMBRE
AND CYNICAL SPIRIT ALL POPULAR APPLAUSE WAS ALWAYS ABHORRENT AND
NOTHING AMUSED HIM MORE AT THE END OF A SUCCESSFUL CASE THAN TO HAND
OVER THE ACTUAL EXPOSURE TO SOME ORTHODOX OFFICIAL AND TO LISTEN
WITH A MOCKING SMILE TO THE GENERAL CHORUS OF MISPLACED
CONGRATULATION IT WAS INDEED THIS ATTITUDE UPON THE PART OF MY
FRIEND AND CERTAINLY NOT ANY LACK OF INTERESTING MATERIAL WHICH HAS
CAUSED ME OF LATE YEARS TO LAY VERY FEW OF MY RECORDS BEFORE THE
PUBLIC MY PARTICIPATION IN SOME IF HIS ADVENTURES WAS ALWAYS A
PRIVILEGE WHICH ENTAILED DISCRETION AND RETICENCE UPON ME
IT WAS THEN WITH CONSIDERABLE SURPRISE THAT I RECEIVED A TELEGRAM
FROM HOMES LAST TUESDAYHE HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO WRITE WHERE A
TELEGRAM WOULD SERVEIN THE FOLLOWING TERMS
WHY NOT TELL THEM OF THE CORNISH HORRORSTRANGEST CASE I HAVE
HANDLED
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT BACKWARD SWEEP OF MEMORY HAD BROUGHT THE MATTER
FRESH TO HIS MIND OR WHAT FREAK HAD CAUSED HIM TO DESIRE THAT I
SHOULD RECOUNT IT BUT I HASTEN BEFORE ANOTHER CANCELLING TELEGRAM
MAY ARRIVE TO HUNT OUT THE NOTES WHICH GIVE ME THE EXACT DETAILS OF
THE CASE AND TO LAY THE NARRATIVE BEFORE MY READERS
IT WAS THEN IN THE SPRING OF THE YEAR THAT HOLMESS IRON
CONSTITUTION SHOWED SOME SYMPTOMS OF GIVING WAY IN THE FACE OF
CONSTANT HARD WORK OF A MOST EXACTING KIND AGGRAVATED PERHAPS BY
OCCASIONAL INDISCRETIONS OF HIS OWN IN MARCH OF THAT YEAR DR MOORE
AGAR OF HARLEY STREET WHOSE DRAMATIC INTRODUCTION TO HOLMES I MAY
SOME DAY RECOUNT GAVE POSITIVE INJUNCTIONS THAT THE FAMOUS PRIVATE
AGENT LAY ASIDE ALL HIS CASES AND SURRENDER HIMSELF TO COMPLETE REST
IF HE WISHED TO AVERT AN ABSOLUTE BREAKDOWN THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH
WAS NOT A MATTER IN WHICH HE HIMSELF TOOK THE FAINTEST INTEREST FOR
HIS MENTAL DETACHMENT WAS ABSOLUTE BUT HE WAS INDUCED AT LAST ON
THE THREAT OF BEING PERMANENTLY DISQUALIFIED FROM WORK TO GIVE
HIMSELF A COMPLETE CHANGE OF SCENE AND AIR THUS IT WAS THAT IN THE
EARLY SPRING OF THAT YEAR WE FOUND OURSELVES TOGETHER IN A SMALL
COTTAGE NEAR POLDHU BAY AT THE FURTHER EXTREMITY OF THE CORNISH
PENINSULA
IT WAS A SINGULAR SPOT AND ONE PECULIARLY WELL SUITED TO THE GRIM
HUMOUR OF MY PATIENT FROM THE WINDOWS OF OUR LITTLE WHITEWASHED
HOUSE WHICH STOOD HIGH UPON A GRASSY HEADLAND WE LOOKED DOWN UPON
THE WHOLE SINISTER SEMICIRCLE OF MOUNTS BAY THAT OLD DEATH TRAP OF
SAILING VESSELS WITH ITS FRINGE OF BLACK CLIFFS AND SURGESWEPT
REEFS ON WHICH INNUMERABLE SEAMEN HAVE MET THEIR END WITH A
NORTHERLY BREEZE IT LIES PLACID AND SHELTERED INVITING THE
STORMTOSSED CRAFT TO TACK INTO IT FOR REST AND PROTECTION
THEN COME THE SUDDEN SWIRL ROUND OF THE WIND THE BLISTERING GALE
FROM THE SOUTHWEST THE DRAGGING ANCHOR THE LEE SHORE AND THE LAST
BATTLE IN THE CREAMING BREAKERS THE WISE MARINER STANDS FAR OUT FROM
THAT EVIL PLACE
ON THE LAND SIDE OUR SURROUNDINGS WERE AS SOMBRE AS ON THE SEA IT
WAS A COUNTRY OF ROLLING MOORS LONELY AND DUNCOLORED WITH AN
OCCASIONAL CHURCH TOWER TO MARK THE SITE OF SOME OLDWORLD VILLAGE
IN EVERY DIRECTION UPON THESE MOORS THERE WERE TRACES OF SOME
VANISHED RACE WHICH HAD PASSED UTTERLY AWAY AND LEFT AS IT SOLE
RECORD STRANGE MONUMENTS OF STONE IRREGULAR MOUNDS WHICH CONTAINED
THE BURNED ASHES OF THE DEAD AND CURIOUS EARTHWORKS WHICH HINTED AT
PREHISTORIC STRIFE THE GLAMOUR AND MYSTERY OF THE PLACE WITH ITS
SINISTER ATMOSPHERE OF FORGOTTEN NATIONS APPEALED TO THE IMAGINATION
OF MY FRIEND AND HE SPENT MUCH OF HIS TIME IN LONG WALKS AND
SOLITARY MEDITATIONS UPON THE MOOR THE ANCIENT CORNISH LANGUAGE HAD
ALSO ARRESTED HIS ATTENTION AND HE HAD I REMEMBER CONCEIVED THE
IDEA THAT IT WAS AKIN TO THE CHALDEAN AND HAD BEEN LARGELY DERIVED
FROM THE PHOENICIAN TRADERS IN TIN HE HAD RECEIVED A CONSIGNMENT OF
BOOKS UPON PHILOLOGY AND WAS SETTLING DOWN TO DEVELOP THIS THESIS
WHEN SUDDENLY TO MY SORROW AND TO HIS UNFEIGNED DELIGHT WE FOUND
OURSELVES EVEN IN THAT LAND OF DREAMS PLUNGED INTO A PROBLEM AT OUR
VERY DOORS WHICH WAS MORE INTENSE MORE ENGROSSING AND INFINITELY
MORE MYSTERIOUS THAN ANY OF THOSE WHICH HAD DRIVEN US FROM LONDON
OUR SIMPLE LIFE AND PEACEFUL HEALTHY ROUTINE WERE VIOLENTLY
INTERRUPTED AND WE WERE PRECIPITATED INTO THE MIDST OF A SERIES OF
EVENTS WHICH CAUSED THE UTMOST EXCITEMENT NOT ONLY IN CORNWALL BUT
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE WEST OF ENGLAND MANY OF MY READERS MAY RETAIN
SOME RECOLLECTION OF WHAT WAS CALLED AT THE TIME THE CORNISH
HORROR THOUGH A MOST IMPERFECT ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER REACHED THE
LONDON PRESS NOW AFTER THIRTEEN YEARS I WILL GIVE THE TRUE DETAILS
OF THIS INCONCEIVABLE AFFAIR TO THE PUBLIC
I HAVE SAID THAT SCATTERED TOWERS MARKED THE VILLAGES WHICH DOTTED
THIS PART OF CORNWALL THE NEAREST OF THESE WAS THE HAMLET OF
TREDANNICK WOLLAS WHERE THE COTTAGES OF A COUPLE OF HUNDRED
INHABITANTS CLUSTERED ROUND AN ANCIENT MOSSGROWN CHURCH THE VICAR
OF THE PARISH MR ROUNDHAY WAS SOMETHING OF AN ARCHAEOLOGIST AND
AS SUCH HOLMES HAD MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE HE WAS A MIDDLEAGED MAN
PORTLY AND AFFABLE WITH A CONSIDERABLE FUND OF LOCAL LORE AT HIS
INVITATION WE HAD TAKEN TEA AT THE VICARAGE AND HAD COME TO KNOW
ALSO MR MORTIMER TREGENNIS AN INDEPENDENT GENTLEMAN WHO INCREASED
THE CLERGYMANS SCANTY RESOURCES BY TAKING ROOMS IN HIS LARGE
STRAGGLING HOUSE THE VICAR BEING A BACHELOR WAS GLAD TO COME TO
SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT THOUGH HE HAD LITTLE IN COMMON WITH HIS LODGER
WHO WAS A THIN DARK SPECTACLED MAN WITH A STOOP WHICH GAVE THE
IMPRESSION OF ACTUAL PHYSICAL DEFORMITY I REMEMBER THAT DURING OUR
SHORT VISIT WE FOUND THE VICAR GARRULOUS BUT HIS LODGER STRANGELY
RETICENT A SADFACED INTROSPECTIVE MAN SITTING WITH AVERTED EYES
BROODING APPARENTLY UPON HIS OWN AFFAIRS
THESE WERE THE TWO MEN WHO ENTERED ABRUPTLY INTO OUR LITTLE
SITTINGROOM ON TUESDAY MARCH THE TH SHORTLY AFTER OUR BREAKFAST
HOUR AS WE WERE SMOKING TOGETHER PREPARATORY TO OUR DAILY EXCURSION
UPON THE MOORS
MR HOLMES SAID THE VICAR IN AN AGITATED VOICE THE MOST
EXTRAORDINARY AND TRAGIC AFFAIR HAS OCCURRED DURING THE NIGHT IT IS
THE MOST UNHEARDOF BUSINESS WE CAN ONLY REGARD IT AS A SPECIAL
PROVIDENCE THAT YOU SHOULD CHANCE TO BE HERE AT THE TIME FOR IN ALL
ENGLAND YOU ARE THE ONE MAN WE NEED
I GLARED AT THE INTRUSIVE VICAR WITH NO VERY FRIENDLY EYES BUT
HOLMES TOOK HIS PIPE FROM HIS LIPS AND SAT UP IN HIS CHAIR LIKE AN
OLD HOUND WHO HEARS THE VIEWHALLOA HE WAVED HIS HAND TO THE SOFA
AND OUR PALPITATING VISITOR WITH HIS AGITATED COMPANION SAT SIDE BY
SIDE UPON IT MR MORTIMER TREGENNIS WAS MORE SELFCONTAINED THAN THE
CLERGYMAN BUT THE TWITCHING OF HIS THIN HANDS AND THE BRIGHTNESS OF
HIS DARK EYES SHOWED THAT THEY SHARED A COMMON EMOTION
SHALL I SPEAK OR YOU HE ASKED OF THE VICAR
WELL AS YOU SEEM TO HAVE MADE THE DISCOVERY WHATEVER IT MAY BE
AND THE VICAR TO HAVE HAD IT SECONDHAND PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER DO
THE SPEAKING SAID HOLMES
I GLANCED AT THE HASTILY CLAD CLERGYMAN WITH THE FORMALLY DRESSED
LODGER SEATED BESIDE HIM AND WAS AMUSED AT THE SURPRISE WHICH
HOLMESS SIMPLE DEDUCTION HAD BROUGHT TO THEIR FACES
PERHAPS I HAD BEST SAY A FEW WORDS FIRST SAID THE VICAR AND THEN
YOU CAN JUDGE IF YOU WILL LISTEN TO THE DETAILS FROM MR TREGENNIS
OR WHETHER WE SHOULD NOT HASTEN AT ONCE TO THE SCENE OF THIS
MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR I MAY EXPLAIN THEN THAT OUR FRIEND HERE SPENT
LAST EVENING IN THE COMPANY OF HIS TWO BROTHERS OWEN AND GEORGE AND
OF HIS SISTER BRENDA AT THEIR HOUSE OF TREDANNICK WARTHA WHICH IS
NEAR THE OLD STONE CROSS UPON THE MOOR HE LEFT THEM SHORTLY AFTER
TEN OCLOCK PLAYING CARDS ROUND THE DININGROOM TABLE IN EXCELLENT
HEALTH AND SPIRITS THIS MORNING BEING AN EARLY RISER HE WALKED IN
THAT DIRECTION BEFORE BREAKFAST AND WAS OVERTAKEN BY THE CARRIAGE OF
DR RICHARDS WHO EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD JUST BEEN SENT FOR ON A MOST
URGENT CALL TO TREDANNICK WARTHA MR MORTIMER TREGENNIS NATURALLY
WENT WITH HIM WHEN HE ARRIVED AT TREDANNICK WARTHA HE FOUND AN
EXTRAORDINARY STATE OF THINGS HIS TWO BROTHERS AND HIS SISTER WERE
SEATED ROUND THE TABLE EXACTLY AS HE HAD LEFT THEM THE CARDS STILL
SPREAD IN FRONT OF THEM AND THE CANDLES BURNED DOWN TO THEIR SOCKETS
THE SISTER LAY BACK STONEDEAD IN HER CHAIR WHILE THE TWO BROTHERS
SAT ON EACH SIDE OF HER LAUGHING SHOUTING AND SINGING THE SENSES
STRICKEN CLEAN OUT OF THEM ALL THREE OF THEM THE DEAD WOMAN AND THE
TWO DEMENTED MEN RETAINED UPON THEIR FACES AN EXPRESSION OF THE
UTMOST HORRORA CONVULSION OF TERROR WHICH WAS DREADFUL TO LOOK
UPON THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE PRESENCE OF ANYONE IN THE HOUSE
EXCEPT MRS PORTER THE OLD COOK AND HOUSEKEEPER WHO DECLARED THAT
SHE HAD SLEPT DEEPLY AND HEARD NO SOUND DURING THE NIGHT NOTHING HAD
BEEN STOLEN OR DISARRANGED AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EXPLANATION OF
WHAT THE HORROR CAN BE WHICH HAS FRIGHTENED A WOMAN TO DEATH AND TWO
STRONG MEN OUT OF THEIR SENSES THERE IS THE SITUATION MR HOLMES
IN A NUTSHELL AND IF YOU CAN HELP US TO CLEAR IT UP YOU WILL HAVE
DONE A GREAT WORK
I HAD HOPED THAT IN SOME WAY I COULD COAX MY COMPANION BACK INTO THE
QUIET WHICH HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF OUR JOURNEY BUT ONE GLANCE AT HIS
INTENSE FACE AND CONTRACTED EYEBROWS TOLD ME HOW VAIN WAS NOW THE
EXPECTATION HE SAT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME IN SILENCE ABSORBED IN THE
STRANGE DRAMA WHICH HAD BROKEN IN UPON OUR PEACE
I WILL LOOK INTO THIS MATTER HE SAID AT LAST ON THE FACE OF IT
IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE A CASE OF A VERY EXCEPTIONAL NATURE HAVE YOU
BEEN THERE YOURSELF MR ROUNDHAY
NO MR HOLMES MR TREGENNIS BROUGHT BACK THE ACCOUNT TO THE
VICARAGE AND I AT ONCE HURRIED OVER WITH HIM TO CONSULT YOU
HOW FAR IS IT TO THE HOUSE WHERE THIS SINGULAR TRAGEDY OCCURRED
ABOUT A MILE INLAND
THEN WE SHALL WALK OVER TOGETHER BUT BEFORE WE START I MUST ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS MR MORTIMER TREGENNIS
THE OTHER HAD BEEN SILENT ALL THIS TIME BUT I HAD OBSERVED THAT HIS
MORE CONTROLLED EXCITEMENT WAS EVEN GREATER THAN THE OBTRUSIVE
EMOTION OF THE CLERGYMAN HE SAT WITH A PALE DRAWN FACE HIS ANXIOUS
GAZE FIXED UPON HOLMES AND HIS THIN HANDS CLASPED CONVULSIVELY
TOGETHER HIS PALE LIPS QUIVERED AS HE LISTENED TO THE DREADFUL
EXPERIENCE WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIS FAMILY AND HIS DARK EYES SEEMED TO
REFLECT SOMETHING OF THE HORROR OF THE SCENE
ASK WHAT YOU LIKE MR HOLMES SAID HE EAGERLY IT IS A BAD THING
TO SPEAK OF BUT I WILL ANSWER YOU THE TRUTH
TELL ME ABOUT LAST NIGHT
WELL MR HOLMES I SUPPED THERE AS THE VICAR HAS SAID AND MY
ELDER BROTHER GEORGE PROPOSED A GAME OF WHIST AFTERWARDS WE SAT DOWN
ABOUT NINE OCLOCK IT WAS A QUARTERPAST TEN WHEN I MOVED TO GO I
LEFT THEM ALL ROUND THE TABLE AS MERRY AS COULD BE
WHO LET YOU OUT
MRS PORTER HAD GONE TO BED SO I LET MYSELF OUT I SHUT THE HALL
DOOR BEHIND ME THE WINDOW OF THE ROOM IN WHICH THEY SAT WAS CLOSED
BUT THE BLIND WAS NOT DRAWN DOWN THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN DOOR OR
WINDOW THIS MORNING OR ANY REASON TO THINK THAT ANY STRANGER HAD
BEEN TO THE HOUSE YET THERE THEY SAT DRIVEN CLEAN MAD WITH TERROR
AND BRENDA LYING DEAD OF FRIGHT WITH HER HEAD HANGING OVER THE ARM
OF THE CHAIR ILL NEVER GET THE SIGHT OF THAT ROOM OUT OF MY MIND SO
LONG AS I LIVE
THE FACTS AS YOU STATE THEM ARE CERTAINLY MOST REMARKABLE SAID
HOLMES I TAKE IT THAT YOU HAVE NO THEORY YOURSELF WHICH CAN IN ANY
WAY ACCOUNT FOR THEM
ITS DEVILISH MR HOLMES DEVILISH CRIED MORTIMER TREGENNIS IT
IS NOT OF THIS WORLD SOMETHING HAS COME INTO THAT ROOM WHICH HAS
DASHED THE LIGHT OF REASON FROM THEIR MINDS WHAT HUMAN CONTRIVANCE
COULD DO THAT
I FEAR SAID HOLMES THAT IF THE MATTER IS BEYOND HUMANITY IT IS
CERTAINLY BEYOND ME YET WE MUST EXHAUST ALL NATURAL EXPLANATIONS
BEFORE WE FALL BACK UPON SUCH A THEORY AS THIS AS TO YOURSELF MR
TREGENNIS I TAKE IT YOU WERE DIVIDED IN SOME WAY FROM YOUR FAMILY
SINCE THEY LIVED TOGETHER AND YOU HAD ROOMS APART
THAT IS SO MR HOLMES THOUGH THE MATTER IS PAST AND DONE WITH WE
WERE A FAMILY OF TINMINERS AT REDRUTH BUT WE SOLD OUR VENTURE TO A
COMPANY AND SO RETIRED WITH ENOUGH TO KEEP US I WONT DENY THAT
THERE WAS SOME FEELING ABOUT THE DIVISION OF THE MONEY AND IT STOOD
BETWEEN US FOR A TIME BUT IT WAS ALL FORGIVEN AND FORGOTTEN AND WE
WERE THE BEST OF FRIENDS TOGETHER
LOOKING BACK AT THE EVENING WHICH YOU SPENT TOGETHER DOES ANYTHING
STAND OUT IN YOUR MEMORY AS THROWING ANY POSSIBLE LIGHT UPON THE
TRAGEDY THINK CAREFULLY MR TREGENNIS FOR ANY CLUE WHICH CAN HELP
ME
THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL SIR
YOUR PEOPLE WERE IN THEIR USUAL SPIRITS
NEVER BETTER
WERE THEY NERVOUS PEOPLE DID THEY EVER SHOW ANY APPREHENSION OF
COMING DANGER
NOTHING OF THE KIND
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO ADD THEN WHICH COULD ASSIST ME
MORTIMER TREGENNIS CONSIDERED EARNESTLY FOR A MOMENT
THERE IS ONE THING OCCURS TO ME SAID HE AT LAST AS WE SAT AT THE
TABLE MY BACK WAS TO THE WINDOW AND MY BROTHER GEORGE HE BEING MY
PARTNER AT CARDS WAS FACING IT I SAW HIM ONCE LOOK HARD OVER MY
SHOULDER SO I TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED ALSO THE BLIND WAS UP AND THE
WINDOW SHUT BUT I COULD JUST MAKE OUT THE BUSHES ON THE LAWN AND IT
SEEMED TO ME FOR A MOMENT THAT I SAW SOMETHING MOVING AMONG THEM I
COULDNT EVEN SAY IF IT WAS MAN OR ANIMAL BUT I JUST THOUGHT THERE
WAS SOMETHING THERE WHEN I ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT HE TOLD
ME THAT HE HAD THE SAME FEELING THAT IS ALL THAT I CAN SAY
DID YOU NOT INVESTIGATE
NO THE MATTER PASSED AS UNIMPORTANT
YOU LEFT THEM THEN WITHOUT ANY PREMONITION OF EVIL
NONE AT ALL
I AM NOT CLEAR HOW YOU CAME TO HEAR THE NEWS SO EARLY THIS MORNING
I AM AN EARLY RISER AND GENERALLY TAKE A WALK BEFORE BREAKFAST THIS
MORNING I HAD HARDLY STARTED WHEN THE DOCTOR IN HIS CARRIAGE OVERTOOK
ME HE TOLD ME THAT OLD MRS PORTER HAD SENT A BOY DOWN WITH AN
URGENT MESSAGE I SPRANG IN BESIDE HIM AND WE DROVE ON WHEN WE GOT
THERE WE LOOKED INTO THAT DREADFUL ROOM THE CANDLES AND THE FIRE
MUST HAVE BURNED OUT HOURS BEFORE AND THEY HAD BEEN SITTING THERE IN
THE DARK UNTIL DAWN HAD BROKEN THE DOCTOR SAID BRENDA MUST HAVE BEEN
DEAD AT LEAST SIX HOURS THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF VIOLENCE SHE JUST
LAY ACROSS THE ARM OF THE CHAIR WITH THAT LOOK ON HER FACE GEORGE
AND OWEN WERE SINGING SNATCHES OF SONGS AND GIBBERING LIKE TWO GREAT
APES OH IT WAS AWFUL TO SEE I COULDNT STAND IT AND THE DOCTOR
WAS AS WHITE AS A SHEET INDEED HE FELL INTO A CHAIR IN A SORT OF
FAINT AND WE NEARLY HAD HIM ON OUR HANDS AS WELL
REMARKABLEMOST REMARKABLE SAID HOLMES RISING AND TAKING HIS
HAT I THINK PERHAPS WE HAD BETTER GO DOWN TO TREDANNICK WARTHA
WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY I CONFESS THAT I HAVE SELDOM KNOWN A CASE
WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT PRESENTED A MORE SINGULAR PROBLEM
OUR PROCEEDINGS OF THAT FIRST MORNING DID LITTLE TO ADVANCE THE
INVESTIGATION IT WAS MARKED HOWEVER AT THE OUTSET BY AN INCIDENT
WHICH LEFT THE MOST SINISTER IMPRESSION UPON MY MIND THE APPROACH TO
THE SPOT AT WHICH THE TRAGEDY OCCURRED IS DOWN A NARROW WINDING
COUNTRY LANE WHILE WE MADE OUR WAY ALONG IT WE HEARD THE RATTLE OF A
CARRIAGE COMING TOWARDS US AND STOOD ASIDE TO LET IT PASS AS IT
DROVE BY US I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE THROUGH THE CLOSED WINDOW OF A
HORRIBLY CONTORTED GRINNING FACE GLARING OUT AT US THOSE STARING
EYES AND GNASHING TEETH FLASHED PAST US LIKE A DREADFUL VISION
MY BROTHERS CRIED MORTIMER TREGENNIS WHITE TO HIS LIPS THEY ARE
TAKING THEM TO HELSTON
WE LOOKED WITH HORROR AFTER THE BLACK CARRIAGE LUMBERING UPON ITS
WAY THEN WE TURNED OUR STEPS TOWARDS THIS ILLOMENED HOUSE IN WHICH
THEY HAD MET THEIR STRANGE FATE
IT WAS A LARGE AND BRIGHT DWELLING RATHER A VILLA THAN A COTTAGE
WITH A CONSIDERABLE GARDEN WHICH WAS ALREADY IN THAT CORNISH AIR
WELL FILLED WITH SPRING FLOWERS TOWARDS THIS GARDEN THE WINDOW OF
THE SITTINGROOM FRONTED AND FROM IT ACCORDING TO MORTIMER
TREGENNIS MUST HAVE COME THAT THING OF EVIL WHICH HAD BY SHEER
HORROR IN A SINGLE INSTANT BLASTED THEIR MINDS HOLMES WALKED SLOWLY
AND THOUGHTFULLY AMONG THE FLOWERPLOTS AND ALONG THE PATH BEFORE WE
ENTERED THE PORCH SO ABSORBED WAS HE IN HIS THOUGHTS I REMEMBER
THAT HE STUMBLED OVER THE WATERINGPOT UPSET ITS CONTENTS AND
DELUGED BOTH OUR FEET AND THE GARDEN PATH INSIDE THE HOUSE WE WERE
MET BY THE ELDERLY CORNISH HOUSEKEEPER MRS PORTER WHO WITH THE
AID OF A YOUNG GIRL LOOKED AFTER THE WANTS OF THE FAMILY SHE
READILY ANSWERED ALL HOLMESS QUESTIONS SHE HAD HEARD NOTHING IN THE
NIGHT HER EMPLOYERS HAD ALL BEEN IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS LATELY AND
SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN THEM MORE CHEERFUL AND PROSPEROUS SHE HAD
FAINTED WITH HORROR UPON ENTERING THE ROOM IN THE MORNING AND SEEING
THAT DREADFUL COMPANY ROUND THE TABLE SHE HAD WHEN SHE RECOVERED
THROWN OPEN THE WINDOW TO LET THE MORNING AIR IN AND HAD RUN DOWN TO
THE LANE WHENCE SHE SENT A FARMLAD FOR THE DOCTOR THE LADY WAS ON
HER BED UPSTAIRS IF WE CARED TO SEE HER IT TOOK FOUR STRONG MEN TO
GET THE BROTHERS INTO THE ASYLUM CARRIAGE SHE WOULD NOT HERSELF STAY
IN THE HOUSE ANOTHER DAY AND WAS STARTING THAT VERY AFTERNOON TO
REJOIN HER FAMILY AT ST IVES
WE ASCENDED THE STAIRS AND VIEWED THE BODY MISS BRENDA TREGENNIS HAD
BEEN A VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL THOUGH NOW VERGING UPON MIDDLE AGE HER
DARK CLEARCUT FACE WAS HANDSOME EVEN IN DEATH BUT THERE STILL
LINGERED UPON IT SOMETHING OF THAT CONVULSION OF HORROR WHICH HAD
BEEN HER LAST HUMAN EMOTION FROM HER BEDROOM WE DESCENDED TO THE
SITTINGROOM WHERE THIS STRANGE TRAGEDY HAD ACTUALLY OCCURRED THE
CHARRED ASHES OF THE OVERNIGHT FIRE LAY IN THE GRATE ON THE TABLE
WERE THE FOUR GUTTERED AND BURNEDOUT CANDLES WITH THE CARDS
SCATTERED OVER ITS SURFACE THE CHAIRS HAD BEEN MOVED BACK AGAINST
THE WALLS BUT ALL ELSE WAS AS IT HAD BEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE HOLMES
PACED WITH LIGHT SWIFT STEPS ABOUT THE ROOM HE SAT IN THE VARIOUS
CHAIRS DRAWING THEM UP AND RECONSTRUCTING THEIR POSITIONS HE TESTED
HOW MUCH OF THE GARDEN WAS VISIBLE HE EXAMINED THE FLOOR THE
CEILING AND THE FIREPLACE BUT NEVER ONCE DID I SEE THAT SUDDEN
BRIGHTENING OF HIS EYES AND TIGHTENING OF HIS LIPS WHICH WOULD HAVE
TOLD ME THAT HE SAW SOME GLEAM OF LIGHT IN THIS UTTER DARKNESS
WHY A FIRE HE ASKED ONCE HAD THEY ALWAYS A FIRE IN THIS SMALL
ROOM ON A SPRING EVENING
MORTIMER TREGENNIS EXPLAINED THAT THE NIGHT WAS COLD AND DAMP FOR
THAT REASON AFTER HIS ARRIVAL THE FIRE WAS LIT WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO NOW MR HOLMES HE ASKED
MY FRIEND SMILED AND LAID HIS HAND UPON MY ARM I THINK WATSON
THAT I SHALL RESUME THAT COURSE OF TOBACCOPOISONING WHICH YOU HAVE
SO OFTEN AND SO JUSTLY CONDEMNED SAID HE WITH YOUR PERMISSION
GENTLEMEN WE WILL NOW RETURN TO OUR COTTAGE FOR I AM NOT AWARE THAT
ANY NEW FACTOR IS LIKELY TO COME TO OUR NOTICE HERE I WILL TURN THE
FACTS OVER IN MY MID MR TREGENNIS AND SHOULD ANYTHING OCCUR TO ME
I WILL CERTAINLY OMMUNICATE WITH YOU AND THE VICAR IN THE MEANTIME I
WISH YOU BOTH GOODMORNING
IT WAS NOT UNTIL LONG AFTER WE WERE BACK IN POLDHU COTTAGE THAT
HOLMES BROKE HIS COMPLETE AND ABSORBED SILENCE HE SAT COILED IN HIS
ARMCHAIR HIS HAGGARD AND ASCETIC FACE HARDLY VISIBLE AMID THE BLUE
SWIRL OF HIS TOBACCO SMOKE HIS BLACK BROWS DRAWN DOWN HIS FOREHEAD
CONTRACTED HIS EYES VACANT AND FAR AWAY FINALLY HE LAID DOWN HIS
PIPE AND SPRANG TO HIS FEET
IT WONT DO WATSON SAID HE WITH A LAUGH LET US WALK ALONG THE
CLIFFS TOGETHER AND SEARCH FOR FLINT ARROWS WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO
FIND THEM THAN CLUES TO THIS PROBLEM TO LET THE BRAIN WORK WITHOUT
SUFFICIENT MATERIAL IS LIKE RACING AN ENGINE IT RACKS ITSELF TO
PIECES THE SEA AIR SUNSHINE AND PATIENCE WATSONALL ELSE WILL
COME
NOW LET US CALMLY DEFINE OUR POSITION WATSON HE CONTINUED AS WE
SKIRTED THE CLIFFS TOGETHER LET US GET A FIRM GRIP OF THE VERY
LITTLE WHICH WE DO KNOW SO THAT WHEN FRESH FACTS ARISE WE MAY BE
READY TO FIT THEM INTO THEIR PLACES I TAKE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE
THAT NEITHER OF US IS PREPARED TO ADMIT DIABOLICAL INTRUSIONS INTO
THE AFFAIRS OF MEN LET US BEGIN BY RULING THAT ENTIRELY OUT OF OUR
MINDS VERY GOOD THERE REMAIN THREE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN GRIEVOUSLY
STRICKEN BY SOME CONSCIOUS OR UNCONSCIOUS HUMAN AGENCY THAT IS FIRM
GROUND NOW WHEN DID THIS OCCUR EVIDENTLY ASSUMING HIS NARRATIVE
TO BE TRUE IT WAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER MR MORTIMER TREGENNIS HAD LEFT
THE ROOM THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT IT
WAS WITHIN A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS THE CARDS STILL LAY UPON THE
TABLE IT WAS ALREADY PAST THEIR USUAL HOUR FOR BED YET THEY HAD NOT
CHANGED THEIR POSITION OR PUSHED BACK THEIR CHAIRS I REPEAT THEN
THAT THE OCCURRENCE WAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS DEPARTURE AND NOT
LATER THAN ELEVEN OCLOCK LAST NIGHT
OUR NEXT OBVIOUS STEP IS TO CHECK SO FAR AS WE CAN THE MOVEMENTS
OF MORTIMER TREGENNIS AFTER HE LEFT THE ROOM IN THIS THERE IS NO
DIFFICULTY AND THEY SEEM TO BE ABOVE SUSPICION KNOWING MY METHODS
AS YOU DO YOU WERE OF COURSE CONSCIOUS OF THE SOMEWHAT CLUMSY
WATERPOT EXPEDIENT BY WHICH I OBTAINED A CLEARER IMPRESS OF HIS FOOT
THAN MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE THE WET SANDY PATH TOOK IT
ADMIRABLY LAST NIGHT WAS ALSO WET YOU WILL REMEMBER AND IT WAS NOT
DIFFICULTHAVING OBTAINED A SAMPLE PRINTTO PICK OUT HIS TRACK
AMONG OTHERS AND TO FOLLOW HIS MOVEMENTS HE APPEARS TO HAVE WALKED
AWAY SWIFTLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VICARAGE
IF THEN MORTIMER TREGENNIS DISAPPEARED FROM THE SCENE AND YET
SOME OUTSIDE PERSON AFFECTED THE CARDPLAYERS HOW CAN WE RECONSTRUCT
THAT PERSON AND HOW WAS SUCH AN IMPRESSION OF HORROR CONVEYED MRS
PORTER MAY BE ELIMINATED SHE IS EVIDENTLY HARMLESS IS THERE ANY
EVIDENCE THAT SOMEONE CREPT UP TO THE GARDEN WINDOW AND IN SOME
MANNER PRODUCED SO TERRIFIC AN EFFECT THAT HE DROVE THOSE WHO SAW IT
OUT OF THEIR SENSES THE ONLY SUGGESTION IN THIS DIRECTION COMES FROM
MORTIMER TREGENNIS HIMSELF WHO SAYS THAT HIS BROTHER SPOKE ABOUT
SOME MOVEMENT IN THE GARDEN THAT IS CERTAINLY REMARKABLE AS THE
NIGHT WAS RAINY CLOUDY AND DARK ANYONE WHO HAD THE DESIGN TO ALARM
THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO PLACE HIS VERY FACE AGAINST THE
GLASS BEFORE HE COULD BE SEEN THERE IS A THREEFOOT FLOWERBORDER
OUTSIDE THIS WINDOW BUT NO INDICATION OF A FOOTMARK IT IS DIFFICULT
TO IMAGINE THEN HOW AN OUTSIDER COULD HAVE MADE SO TERRIBLE AN
IMPRESSION UPON THE COMPANY NOR HAVE WE FOUND ANY POSSIBLE MOTIVE
FOR SO STRANGE AND ELABORATE AN ATTEMPT YOU PERCEIVE OUR
DIFFICULTIES WATSON
THEY ARE ONLY TOO CLEAR I ANSWERED WITH CONVICTION
AND YET WITH A LITTLE MORE MATERIAL WE MAY PROVE THAT THEY ARE NOT
INSURMOUNTABLE SAID HOLMES I FANCY THAT AMONG YOUR EXTENSIVE
ARCHIVES WATSON YOU MAY FIND SOME WHICH WERE NEARLY AS OBSCURE
MEANWHILE WE SHALL PUT THE CASE ASIDE UNTIL MORE ACCURATE DATA ARE
AVAILABLE AND DEVOTE THE REST OF OUR MORNING TO THE PURSUIT OF
NEOLITHIC MAN
I MAY HAVE COMMENTED UPON MY FRIENDS POWER OF MENTAL DETACHMENT BUT
NEVER HAVE I WONDERED AT IT MORE THAN UPON THAT SPRING MORNING IN
CORNWALL WHEN FOR TWO HOURS HE DISCOURSED UPON CELTS ARROWHEADS AND
SHARDS AS LIGHTLY AS IF NO SINISTER MYSTERY WERE WAITING FOR HIS
SOLUTION IT WAS NOT UNTIL WE HAD RETURNED IN THE AFTERNOON TO OUR
COTTAGE THAT WE FOUND A VISITOR AWAITING US WHO SOON BROUGHT OUR
MINDS BACK TO THE MATTER IN HAND NEITHER OF US NEEDED TO BE TOLD WHO
THAT VISITOR WAS THE HUGE BODY THE CRAGGY AND DEEPLY SEAMED FACE
WITH THE FIERCE EYES AND HAWKLIKE NOSE THE GRIZZLED HAIR WHICH
NEARLY BRUSHED OUR COTTAGE CEILING THE BEARDGOLDEN AT THE FRINGES
AND WHITE NEAR THE LIPS SAVE FOR THE NICOTINE STAIN FROM HIS
PERPETUAL CIGARALL THESE WERE AS WELL KNOWN IN LONDON AS IN AFRICA
AND COULD ONLY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TREMENDOUS PERSONALITY OF DR
LEON STERNDALE THE GREAT LIONHUNTER AND EXPLORER
WE HAD HEARD OF HIS PRESENCE IN THE DISTRICT AND HAD ONCE OR TWICE
CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS TALL FIGURE UPON THE MOORLAND PATHS HE MADE NO
ADVANCES TO US HOWEVER NOR WOULD WE HAVE DREAMED OF DOING SO TO
HIM AS IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT IT WAS HIS LOVE OF SECLUSION WHICH
CAUSED HIM TO SPEND THE GREATER PART OF THE INTERVALS BETWEEN HIS
JOURNEYS IN A SMALL BUNGALOW BURIED IN THE LONELY WOOD OF BEAUCHAMP
ARRIANCE HERE AMID HIS BOOKS AND HIS MAPS HE LIVED AN ABSOLUTELY
LONELY LIFE ATTENDING TO HIS OWN SIMPLE WANTS AND PAYING LITTLE
APPARENT HEED TO THE AFFAIRS OF HIS NEIGHBOURS IT WAS A SURPRISE TO
ME THEREFORE TO HEAR HIM ASKING HOLMES IN AN EAGER VOICE WHETHER HE
HAD MADE ANY ADVANCE IN HIS RECONSTRUCTION OF THIS MYSTERIOUS
EPISODE THE COUNTY POLICE ARE UTTERLY AT FAULT SAID HE BUT
PERHAPS YOUR WIDER EXPERIENCE HAS SUGGESTED SOME CONCEIVABLE
EXPLANATION MY ONLY CLAIM TO BEING TAKEN INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE IS
THAT DURING MY MANY RESIDENCES HERE I HAVE COME TO KNOW THIS FAMILY
OF TREGENNIS VERY WELLINDEED UPON MY CORNISH MOTHERS SIDE I COULD
CALL THEM COUSINSAND THEIR STRANGE FATE HAS NATURALLY BEEN A GREAT
SHOCK TO ME I MAY TELL YOU THAT I HAD GOT AS FAR AS PLYMOUTH UPON MY
WAY TO AFRICA BUT THE NEWS REACHED ME THIS MORNING AND I CAME
STRAIGHT BACK AGAIN TO HELP IN THE INQUIRY
HOLMES RAISED HIS EYEBROWS
DID YOU LOSE YOUR BOAT THROUGH IT
I WILL TAKE THE NEXT
DEAR ME THAT IS FRIENDSHIP INDEED
I TELL YOU THEY WERE RELATIVES
QUITE SOCOUSINS OF YOUR MOTHER WAS YOUR BAGGAGE ABOARD THE SHIP
SOME OF IT BUT THE MAIN PART AT THE HOTEL
I SEE BUT SURELY THIS EVENT COULD NOT HAVE FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE
PLYMOUTH MORNING PAPERS
NO SIR I HAD A TELEGRAM
MIGHT I ASK FROM WHOM
A SHADOW PASSED OVER THE GAUNT FACE OF THE EXPLORER
YOU ARE VERY INQUISITIVE MR HOLMES
IT IS MY BUSINESS
WITH AN EFFORT DR STERNDALE RECOVERED HIS RUFFLED COMPOSURE
I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO TELLING YOU HE SAID IT WAS MR ROUNDHAY
THE VICAR WHO SENT ME THE TELEGRAM WHICH RECALLED ME
THANK YOU SAID HOLMES I MAY SAY IN ANSWER TO YOUR ORIGINAL
QUESTION THAT I HAVE NOT CLEARED MY MIND ENTIRELY ON THE SUBJECT OF
THIS CASE BUT THAT I HAVE EVERY HOPE OF REACHING SOME CONCLUSION IT
WOULD BE PREMATURE TO SAY MORE
PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT MIND TELLING ME IF YOUR SUSPICIONS POINT IN
ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION
NO I CAN HARDLY ANSWER THAT
THEN I HAVE WASTED MY TIME AND NEED NOT PROLONG MY VISIT THE
FAMOUS DOCTOR STRODE OUT OF OUR COTTAGE IN CONSIDERABLE ILLHUMOUR
AND WITHIN FIVE MINUTES HOLMES HAD FOLLOWED HIM I SAW HIM NO MORE
UNTIL THE EVENING WHEN HE RETURNED WITH A SLOW STEP AND HAGGARD FACE
WHICH ASSURED ME THAT HE HAD MADE NO GREAT PROGRESS WITH HIS
INVESTIGATION HE GLANCED AT A TELEGRAM WHICH AWAITED HIM AND THREW
IT INTO THE GRATE
FROM THE PLYMOUTH HOTEL WATSON HE SAID I LEARNED THE NAME OF IT
FROM THE VICAR AND I WIRED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT DR LEON STERNDALES
ACCOUNT WAS TRUE IT APPEARS THAT HE DID INDEED SPEND LAST NIGHT
THERE AND THAT HE HAS ACTUALLY ALLOWED SOME OF HIS BAGGAGE TO GO ON
TO AFRICA WHILE HE RETURNED TO BE PRESENT AT THIS INVESTIGATION
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT WATSON
HE IS DEEPLY INTERESTED
DEEPLY INTERESTEDYES THERE IS A THREAD HERE WHICH WE HAD NOT YET
GRASPED AND WHICH MIGHT LEAD US THROUGH THE TANGLE CHEER UP WATSON
FOR I AM VERY SURE THAT OUR MATERIAL HAS NOT YET ALL COME TO HAND
WHEN IT DOES WE MAY SOON LEAVE OUR DIFFICULTIES BEHIND US
LITTLE DID I THINK HOW SOON THE WORDS OF HOLMES WOULD BE REALIZED OR
HOW STRANGE AND SINISTER WOULD BE THAT NEW DEVELOPMENT WHICH OPENED
UP AN ENTIRELY FRESH LINE OF INVESTIGATION I WAS SHAVING AT MY
WINDOW IN THE MORNING WHEN I HEARD THE RATTLE OF HOOFS AND LOOKING
UP SAW A DOGCART COMING AT A GALLOP DOWN THE ROAD IT PULLED UP AT
OUR DOOR AND OUR FRIEND THE VICAR SPRANG FROM IT AND RUSHED UP OUR
GARDEN PATH HOLMES WAS ALREADY DRESSED AND WE HASTENED DOWN TO MEET
HIM
OUR VISITOR WAS SO EXCITED THAT HE COULD HARDLY ARTICULATE BUT AT
LAST IN GASPS AND BURSTS HIS TRAGIC STORY CAME OUT OF HIM
WE ARE DEVILRIDDEN MR HOLMES MY POOR PARISH IS DEVILRIDDEN HE
CRIED SATAN HIMSELF IS LOOSE IN IT WE ARE GIVEN OVER INTO HIS
HANDS HE DANCED ABOUT IN HIS AGITATION A LUDICROUS OBJECT IF IT
WERE NOT FOR HIS ASHY FACE AND STARTLED EYES FINALLY HE SHOT OUT HIS
TERRIBLE NEWS
MR MORTIMER TREGENNIS DIED DURING THE NIGHT AND WITH EXACTLY THE
SAME SYMPTOMS AS THE REST OF HIS FAMILY
HOLMES SPRANG TO HIS FEET ALL ENERGY IN AN INSTANT
CAN YOU FIT US BOTH INTO YOUR DOGCART
YES I CAN
THEN WATSON WE WILL POSTPONE OUR BREAKFAST MR ROUNDHAY WE ARE
ENTIRELY AT YOUR DISPOSAL HURRYHURRY BEFORE THINGS GET
DISARRANGED
THE LODGER OCCUPIED TWO ROOMS AT THE VICARAGE WHICH WERE IN AN ANGLE
BY THEMSELVES THE ONE ABOVE THE OTHER BELOW WAS A LARGE
SITTINGROOM ABOVE HIS BEDROOM THEY LOOKED OUT UPON A CROQUET LAWN
WHICH CAME UP TO THE WINDOWS WE HAD ARRIVED BEFORE THE DOCTOR OR THE
POLICE SO THAT EVERYTHING WAS ABSOLUTELY UNDISTURBED LET ME
DESCRIBE EXACTLY THE SCENE AS WE SAW IT UPON THAT MISTY MARCH
MORNING IT HAS LEFT AN IMPRESSION WHICH CAN NEVER BE EFFACED FROM MY
MIND
THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE ROOM WAS OF A HORRIBLE AND DEPRESSING
STUFFINESS THE SERVANT WHO HAD FIRST ENTERED HAD THROWN UP THE
WINDOW OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE INTOLERABLE THIS MIGHT
PARTLY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT A LAMP STOOD FLARING AND SMOKING ON
THE CENTRE TABLE BESIDE IT SAT THE DEAD MAN LEANING BACK IN HIS
CHAIR HIS THIN BEARD PROJECTING HIS SPECTACLES PUSHED UP ON TO HIS
FOREHEAD AND HIS LEAN DARK FACE TURNED TOWARDS THE WINDOW AND
TWISTED INTO THE SAME DISTORTION OF TERROR WHICH HAD MARKED THE
FEATURES OF HIS DEAD SISTER HIS LIMBS WERE CONVULSED AND HIS FINGERS
CONTORTED AS THOUGH HE HAD DIED IN A VERY PAROXYSM OF FEAR HE WAS
FULLY CLOTHED THOUGH THERE WERE SIGNS THAT HIS DRESSING HAD BEEN
DONE IN A HURRY WE HAD ALREADY LEARNED THAT HIS BED HAD BEEN SLEPT
IN AND THAT THE TRAGIC END HAD COME TO HIM IN THE EARLY MORNING
ONE REALIZED THE REDHOT ENERGY WHICH UNDERLAY HOLMESS PHLEGMATIC
EXTERIOR WHEN ONE SAW THE SUDDEN CHANGE WHICH CAME OVER HIM FROM THE
MOMENT THAT HE ENTERED THE FATAL APARTMENT IN AN INSTANT HE WAS
TENSE AND ALERT HIS EYES SHINING HIS FACE SET HIS LIMBS QUIVERING
WITH EAGER ACTIVITY HE WAS OUT ON THE LAWN IN THROUGH THE WINDOW
ROUND THE ROOM AND UP INTO THE BEDROOM FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A
DASHING FOXHOUND DRAWING A COVER IN THE BEDROOM HE MADE A RAPID CAST
AROUND AND ENDED BY THROWING OPEN THE WINDOW WHICH APPEARED TO GIVE
HIM SOME FRESH CAUSE FOR EXCITEMENT FOR HE LEANED OUT OF IT WITH
LOUD EJACULATIONS OF INTEREST AND DELIGHT THEN HE RUSHED DOWN THE
STAIR OUT THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW THREW HIMSELF UPON HIS FACE ON
THE LAWN SPRANG UP AND INTO THE ROOM ONCE MORE ALL WITH THE ENERGY
OF THE HUNTER WHO IS AT THE VERY HEELS OF HIS QUARRY THE LAMP WHICH
WAS AN ORDINARY STANDARD HE EXAMINED WITH MINUTE CARE MAKING
CERTAIN MEASUREMENTS UPON ITS BOWL HE CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED WITH HIS
LENS THE TALC SHIELD WHICH COVERED THE TOP OF THE CHIMNEY AND SCRAPED
OFF SOME ASHES WHICH ADHERED TO ITS UPPER SURFACE PUTTING SOME OF
THEM INTO AN ENVELOPE WHICH HE PLACED IN HIS POCKETBOOK FINALLY
JUST AS THE DOCTOR AND THE OFFICIAL POLICE PUT IN AN APPEARANCE HE
BECKONED TO THE VICAR AND WE ALL THREE WENT OUT UPON THE LAWN
I AM GLAD TO SAY THAT MY INVESTIGATION HAS NOT BEEN ENTIRELY
BARREN HE REMARKED I CANNOT REMAIN TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH THE
POLICE BUT I SHOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED MR ROUNDHAY IF YOU
WOULD GIVE THE INSPECTOR MY COMPLIMENTS AND DIRECT HIS ATTENTION TO
THE BEDROOM WINDOW AND TO THE SITTINGROOM LAMP EACH IS SUGGESTIVE
AND TOGETHER THEY ARE ALMOST CONCLUSIVE IF THE POLICE WOULD DESIRE
FURTHER INFORMATION I SHALL BE HAPPY TO SEE ANY OF THEM AT THE
COTTAGE AND NOW WATSON I THINK THAT PERHAPS WE SHALL BE BETTER
EMPLOYED ELSEWHERE
IT MAY BE THAT THE POLICE RESENTED THE INTRUSION OF AN AMATEUR OR
THAT THEY IMAGINED THEMSELVES TO BE UPON SOME HOPEFUL LINE OF
INVESTIGATION BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT WE HEARD NOTHING FROM THEM FOR
THE NEXT TWO DAYS DURING THIS TIME HOLMES SPENT SOME OF HIS TIME
SMOKING AND DREAMING IN THE COTTAGE BUT A GREATER PORTION IN COUNTRY
WALKS WHICH HE UNDERTOOK ALONE RETURNING AFTER MANY HOURS WITHOUT
REMARK AS TO WHERE HE HAD BEEN ONE EXPERIMENT SERVED TO SHOW ME THE
LINE OF HIS INVESTIGATION HE HAD BOUGHT A LAMP WHICH WAS THE
DUPLICATE OF THE ONE WHICH HAD BURNED IN THE ROOM OF MORTIMER
TREGENNIS ON THE MORNING OF THE TRAGEDY THIS HE FILLED WITH THE SAME
OIL AS THAT USED AT THE VICARAGE AND HE CAREFULLY TIMED THE PERIOD
WHICH IT WOULD TAKE TO BE EXHAUSTED ANOTHER EXPERIMENT WHICH HE MADE
WAS OF A MORE UNPLEASANT NATURE AND ONE WHICH I AM NOT LIKELY EVER
TO FORGET
YOU WILL REMEMBER WATSON HE REMARKED ONE AFTERNOON THAT THERE
IS A SINGLE COMMON POINT OF RESEMBLANCE IN THE VARYING REPORTS WHICH
HAVE REACHED US THIS CONCERNS THE EFFECT OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE
ROOM IN EACH CASE UPON THOSE WHO HAD FIRST ENTERED IT YOU WILL
RECOLLECT THAT MORTIMER TREGENNIS IN DESCRIBING THE EPISODE OF HIS
LAST VISIT TO HIS BROTHERS HOUSE REMARKED THAT THE DOCTOR ON
ENTERING THE ROOM FELL INTO A CHAIR YOU HAD FORGOTTEN WELL I CAN
ANSWER FOR IT THAT IT WAS SO NOW YOU WILL REMEMBER ALSO THAT MRS
PORTER THE HOUSEKEEPER TOLD US THAT SHE HERSELF FAINTED UPON
ENTERING THE ROOM AND HAD AFTERWARDS OPENED THE WINDOW IN THE SECOND
CASETHAT OF MORTIMER TREGENNIS HIMSELFYOU CANNOT HAVE FORGOTTEN
THE HORRIBLE STUFFINESS OF THE ROOM WHEN WE ARRIVED THOUGH THE
SERVANT HAD THROWN OPEN THE WINDOW THAT SERVANT I FOUND UPON
INQUIRY WAS SO ILL THAT SHE HAD GONE TO HER BED YOU WILL ADMIT
WATSON THAT THESE FACTS ARE VERY SUGGESTIVE IN EACH CASE THERE IS
EVIDENCE OF A POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN EACH CASE ALSO THERE IS
COMBUSTION GOING ON IN THE ROOMIN THE ONE CASE A FIRE IN THE OTHER
A LAMP THE FIRE WAS NEEDED BUT THE LAMP WAS LITAS A COMPARISON OF
THE OIL CONSUMED WILL SHOWLONG AFTER IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT WHY
SURELY BECAUSE THERE IS SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THREE THINGSTHE
BURNING THE STUFFY ATMOSPHERE AND FINALLY THE MADNESS OR DEATH OF
THOSE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THAT IS CLEAR IS IT NOT
IT WOULD APPEAR SO
AT LEAST WE MAY ACCEPT IT AS A WORKING HYPOTHESIS WE WILL SUPPOSE
THEN THAT SOMETHING WAS BURNED IN EACH CASE WHICH PRODUCED AN
ATMOSPHERE CAUSING STRANGE TOXIC EFFECTS VERY GOOD IN THE FIRST
INSTANCETHAT OF THE TREGENNIS FAMILYTHIS SUBSTANCE WAS PLACED IN
THE FIRE NOW THE WINDOW WAS SHUT BUT THE FIRE WOULD NATURALLY CARRY
FUMES TO SOME EXTENT UP THE CHIMNEY HENCE ONE WOULD EXPECT THE
EFFECTS OF THE POISON TO BE LESS THAN IN THE SECOND CASE WHERE THERE
WAS LESS ESCAPE FOR THE VAPOUR THE RESULT SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT IT
WAS SO SINCE IN THE FIRST CASE ONLY THE WOMAN WHO HAD PRESUMABLY
THE MORE SENSITIVE ORGANISM WAS KILLED THE OTHERS EXHIBITING THAT
TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT LUNACY WHICH IS EVIDENTLY THE FIRST EFFECT OF
THE DRUG IN THE SECOND CASE THE RESULT WAS COMPLETE THE FACTS
THEREFORE SEEM TO BEAR OUT THE THEORY OF A POISON WHICH WORKED BY
COMBUSTION
WITH THIS TRAIN OF REASONING IN MY HEAD I NATURALLY LOOKED ABOUT IN
MORTIMER TREGENNISS ROOM TO FIND SOME REMAINS OF THIS SUBSTANCE THE
OBVIOUS PLACE TO LOOK WAS THE TALC SHELF OR SMOKEGUARD OF THE LAMP
THERE SURE ENOUGH I PERCEIVED A NUMBER OF FLAKY ASHES AND ROUND
THE EDGES A FRINGE OF BROWNISH POWDER WHICH HAD NOT YET BEEN
CONSUMED HALF OF THIS I TOOK AS YOU SAW AND I PLACED IT IN AN
ENVELOPE
WHY HALF HOLMES
IT IS NOT FOR ME MY DEAR WATSON TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THE
OFFICIAL POLICE FORCE I LEAVE THEM ALL THE EVIDENCE WHICH I FOUND
THE POISON STILL REMAINED UPON THE TALC HAD THEY THE WIT TO FIND IT
NOW WATSON WE WILL LIGHT OUR LAMP WE WILL HOWEVER TAKE THE
PRECAUTION TO OPEN OUR WINDOW TO AVOID THE PREMATURE DECEASE OF TWO
DESERVING MEMBERS OF SOCIETY AND YOU WILL SEAT YOURSELF NEAR THAT
OPEN WINDOW IN AN ARMCHAIR UNLESS LIKE A SENSIBLE MAN YOU DETERMINE
TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE AFFAIR OH YOU WILL SEE IT OUT WILL
YOU I THOUGHT I KNEW MY WATSON THIS CHAIR I WILL PLACE OPPOSITE
YOURS SO THAT WE MAY BE THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE POISON AND FACE
TO FACE THE DOOR WE WILL LEAVE AJAR EACH IS NOW IN A POSITION TO
WATCH THE OTHER AND TO BRING THE EXPERIMENT TO AN END SHOULD THE
SYMPTOMS SEEM ALARMING IS THAT ALL CLEAR WELL THEN I TAKE OUR
POWDEROR WHAT REMAINS OF ITFROM THE ENVELOPE AND I LAY IT ABOVE
THE BURNING LAMP SO NOW WATSON LET US SIT DOWN AND AWAIT
DEVELOPMENTS
THEY WERE NOT LONG IN COMING I HAD HARDLY SETTLED IN MY CHAIR BEFORE
I WAS CONSCIOUS OF A THICK MUSKY ODOUR SUBTLE AND NAUSEOUS AT THE
VERY FIRST WHIFF OF IT MY BRAIN AND MY IMAGINATION WERE BEYOND ALL
CONTROL A THICK BLACK CLOUD SWIRLED BEFORE MY EYES AND MY MIND
TOLD ME THAT IN THIS CLOUD UNSEEN AS YET BUT ABOUT TO SPRING OUT
UPON MY APPALLED SENSES LURKED ALL THAT WAS VAGUELY HORRIBLE ALL
THAT WAS MONSTROUS AND INCONCEIVABLY WICKED IN THE UNIVERSE VAGUE
SHAPES SWIRLED AND SWAM AMID THE DARK CLOUDBANK EACH A MENACE AND A
WARNING OF SOMETHING COMING THE ADVENT OF SOME UNSPEAKABLE DWELLER
UPON THE THRESHOLD WHOSE VERY SHADOW WOULD BLAST MY SOUL A FREEZING
HORROR TOOK POSSESSION OF ME I FELT THAT MY HAIR WAS RISING THAT MY
EYES WERE PROTRUDING THAT MY MOUTH WAS OPENED AND MY TONGUE LIKE
LEATHER THE TURMOIL WITHIN MY BRAIN WAS SUCH THAT SOMETHING MUST
SURELY SNAP I TRIED TO SCREAM AND WAS VAGUELY AWARE OF SOME HOARSE
CROAK WHICH WAS MY OWN VOICE BUT DISTANT AND DETACHED FROM MYSELF
AT THE SAME MOMENT IN SOME EFFORT OF ESCAPE I BROKE THROUGH THAT
CLOUD OF DESPAIR AND HAD A GLIMPSE OF HOLMESS FACE WHITE RIGID
AND DRAWN WITH HORRORTHE VERY LOOK WHICH I HAD SEEN UPON THE
FEATURES OF THE DEAD IT WAS THAT VISION WHICH GAVE ME AN INSTANT OF
SANITY AND OF STRENGTH I DASHED FROM MY CHAIR THREW MY ARMS ROUND
HOLMES AND TOGETHER WE LURCHED THROUGH THE DOOR AND AN INSTANT
AFTERWARDS HAD THROWN OURSELVES DOWN UPON THE GRASS PLOT AND WERE
LYING SIDE BY SIDE CONSCIOUS ONLY OF THE GLORIOUS SUNSHINE WHICH WAS
BURSTING ITS WAY THROUGH THE HELLISH CLOUD OF TERROR WHICH HAD GIRT
US IN SLOWLY IT ROSE FROM OUR SOULS LIKE THE MISTS FROM A LANDSCAPE
UNTIL PEACE AND REASON HAD RETURNED AND WE WERE SITTING UPON THE
GRASS WIPING OUR CLAMMY FOREHEADS AND LOOKING WITH APPREHENSION AT
EACH OTHER TO MARK THE LAST TRACES OF THAT TERRIFIC EXPERIENCE WHICH
WE HAD UNDERGONE
UPON MY WORD WATSON SAID HOLMES AT LAST WITH AN UNSTEADY VOICE
I OWE YOU BOTH MY THANKS AND AN APOLOGY IT WAS AN UNJUSTIFIABLE
EXPERIMENT EVEN FOR ONES SELF AND DOUBLY SO FOR A FRIEND I AM
REALLY VERY SORRY
YOU KNOW I ANSWERED WITH SOME EMOTION FOR I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO
MUCH OF HOLMESS HEART BEFORE THAT IT IS MY GREATEST JOY AND
PRIVILEGE TO HELP YOU
HE RELAPSED AT ONCE INTO THE HALFHUMOROUS HALFCYNICAL VEIN WHICH
WAS HIS HABITUAL ATTITUDE TO THOSE ABOUT HIM IT WOULD BE
SUPERFLUOUS TO DRIVE US MAD MY DEAR WATSON SAID HE A CANDID
OBSERVER WOULD CERTAINLY DECLARE THAT WE WERE SO ALREADY BEFORE WE
EMBARKED UPON SO WILD AN EXPERIMENT I CONFESS THAT I NEVER IMAGINED
THAT THE EFFECT COULD BE SO SUDDEN AND SO SEVERE HE DASHED INTO THE
COTTAGE AND REAPPEARING WITH THE BURNING LAMP HELD AT FULL ARMS
LENGTH HE THREW IT AMONG A BANK OF BRAMBLES WE MUST GIVE THE ROOM
A LITTLE TIME TO CLEAR I TAKE IT WATSON THAT YOU HAVE NO LONGER A
SHADOW OF A DOUBT AS TO HOW THESE TRAGEDIES WERE PRODUCED
NONE WHATEVER
BUT THE CAUSE REMAINS AS OBSCURE AS BEFORE COME INTO THE ARBOUR
HERE AND LET US DISCUSS IT TOGETHER THAT VILLAINOUS STUFF SEEMS
STILL TO LINGER ROUND MY THROAT I THINK WE MUST ADMIT THAT ALL THE
EVIDENCE POINTS TO THIS MAN MORTIMER TREGENNIS HAVING BEEN THE
CRIMINAL IN THE FIRST TRAGEDY THOUGH HE WAS THE VICTIM IN THE SECOND
ONE WE MUST REMEMBER IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THERE IS SOME STORY
OF A FAMILY QUARREL FOLLOWED BY A RECONCILIATION HOW BITTER THAT
QUARREL MAY HAVE BEEN OR HOW HOLLOW THE RECONCILIATION WE CANNOT
TELL WHEN I THINK OF MORTIMER TREGENNIS WITH THE FOXY FACE AND THE
SMALL SHREWD BEADY EYES BEHIND THE SPECTACLES HE IS NOT A MAN WHOM
I SHOULD JUDGE TO BE OF A PARTICULARLY FORGIVING DISPOSITION WELL
IN THE NEXT PLACE YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT THIS IDEA OF SOMEONE MOVING
IN THE GARDEN WHICH TOOK OUR ATTENTION FOR A MOMENT FROM THE REAL
CAUSE OF THE TRAGEDY EMANATED FROM HIM HE HAD A MOTIVE IN
MISLEADING US FINALLY IF HE DID NOT THROW THE SUBSTANCE INTO THE
FIRE AT THE MOMENT OF LEAVING THE ROOM WHO DID DO SO THE AFFAIR
HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS DEPARTURE HAD ANYONE ELSE COME IN
THE FAMILY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE RISEN FROM THE TABLE BESIDES IN
PEACEFUL CORNWALL VISITORS DID NOT ARRIVE AFTER TEN OCLOCK AT
NIGHT WE MAY TAKE IT THEN THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO MORTIMER
TREGENNIS AS THE CULPRIT
THEN HIS OWN DEATH WAS SUICIDE
WELL WATSON IT IS ON THE FACE OF IT A NOT IMPOSSIBLE SUPPOSITION
THE MAN WHO HAD THE GUILT UPON HIS SOUL OF HAVING BROUGHT SUCH A FATE
UPON HIS OWN FAMILY MIGHT WELL BE DRIVEN BY REMORSE TO INFLICT IT
UPON HIMSELF THERE ARE HOWEVER SOME COGENT REASONS AGAINST IT
FORTUNATELY THERE IS ONE MAN IN ENGLAND WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT AND
I HAVE MADE ARRANGEMENTS BY WHICH WE SHALL HEAR THE FACTS THIS
AFTERNOON FROM HIS OWN LIPS AH HE IS A LITTLE BEFORE HIS TIME
PERHAPS YOU WOULD KINDLY STEP THIS WAY DR LEON STERNDALE WE HAVE
BEEN CONDUCING A CHEMICAL EXPERIMENT INDOORS WHICH HAS LEFT OUR
LITTLE ROOM HARDLY FIT FOR THE RECEPTION OF SO DISTINGUISHED A
VISITOR
I HAD HEARD THE CLICK OF THE GARDEN GATE AND NOW THE MAJESTIC FIGURE
OF THE GREAT AFRICAN EXPLORER APPEARED UPON THE PATH HE TURNED IN
SOME SURPRISE TOWARDS THE RUSTIC ARBOUR IN WHICH WE SAT
YOU SENT FOR ME MR HOLMES I HAD YOUR NOTE ABOUT AN HOUR AGO AND
I HAVE COME THOUGH I REALLY DO NOT KNOW WHY I SHOULD OBEY YOUR
SUMMONS
PERHAPS WE CAN CLEAR THE POINT UP BEFORE WE SEPARATE SAID HOLMES
MEANWHILE I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR COURTEOUS ACQUIESCENCE
YOU WILL EXCUSE THIS INFORMAL RECEPTION IN THE OPEN AIR BUT MY
FRIEND WATSON AND I HAVE NEARLY FURNISHED AN ADDITIONAL CHAPTER TO
WHAT THE PAPERS CALL THE CORNISH HORROR AND WE PREFER A CLEAR
ATMOSPHERE FOR THE PRESENT PERHAPS SINCE THE MATTERS WHICH WE HAVE
TO DISCUSS WILL AFFECT YOU PERSONALLY IN A VERY INTIMATE FASHION IT
IS AS WELL THAT WE SHOULD TALK WHERE THERE CAN BE NO EAVESDROPPING
THE EXPLORER TOOK HIS CIGAR FROM HIS LIPS AND GAZED STERNLY AT MY
COMPANION
I AM AT A LOSS TO KNOW SIR HE SAID WHAT YOU CAN HAVE TO SPEAK
ABOUT WHICH AFFECTS ME PERSONALLY IN A VERY INTIMATE FASHION
THE KILLING OF MORTIMER TREGENNIS SAID HOLMES
FOR A MOMENT I WISHED THAT I WERE ARMED STERNDALES FIERCE FACE
TURNED TO A DUSKY RED HIS EYES GLARED AND THE KNOTTED PASSIONATE
VEINS STARTED OUT IN HIS FOREHEAD WHILE HE SPRANG FORWARD WITH
CLENCHED HANDS TOWARDS MY COMPANION THEN HE STOPPED AND WITH A
VIOLENT EFFORT HE RESUMED A COLD RIGID CALMNESS WHICH WAS PERHAPS
MORE SUGGESTIVE OF DANGER THAN HIS HOTHEADED OUTBURST
I HAVE LIVED SO LONG AMONG SAVAGES AND BEYOND THE LAW SAID HE
THAT I HAVE GOT INTO THE WAY OF BEING A LAW TO MYSELF YOU WOULD DO
WELL MR HOLMES NOT TO FORGET IT FOR I HAVE NO DESIRE TO DO YOU AN
INJURY
NOR HAVE I ANY DESIRE TO DO YOU AN INJURY DR STERNDALE SURELY THE
CLEAREST PROOF OF IT IS THAT KNOWING WHAT I KNOW I HAVE SENT FOR
YOU AND NOT FOR THE POLICE
STERNDALE SAT DOWN WITH A GASP OVERAWED FOR PERHAPS THE FIRST TIME
IN HIS ADVENTUROUS LIFE THERE WAS A CALM ASSURANCE OF POWER IN
HOLMESS MANNER WHICH COULD NOT BE WITHSTOOD OUR VISITOR STAMMERED
FOR A MOMENT HIS GREAT HANDS OPENING AND SHUTTING IN HIS AGITATION
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE ASKED AT LAST IF THIS IS BLUFF UPON YOUR
PART MR HOLMES YOU HAVE CHOSEN A BAD MAN FOR YOUR EXPERIMENT LET
US HAVE NO MORE BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I WILL TELL YOU SAID HOLMES AND THE REASON WHY I TELL YOU IS
THAT I HOPE FRANKNESS MAY BEGET FRANKNESS WHAT MY NEXT STEP MAY BE
WILL DEPEND ENTIRELY UPON THE NATURE OF YOUR OWN DEFENCE
MY DEFENCE
YES SIR
MY DEFENCE AGAINST WHAT
AGAINST THE CHARGE OF KILLING MORTIMER TREGENNIS
STERNDALE MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF UPON MY WORD
YOU ARE GETTING ON SAID HE DO ALL YOUR SUCCESSES DEPEND UPON THIS
PRODIGIOUS POWER OF BLUFF
THE BLUFF SAID HOLMES STERNLY IS UPON YOUR SIDE DR LEON
STERNDALE AND NOT UPON MINE AS A PROOF I WILL TELL YOU SOME OF THE
FACTS UPON WHICH MY CONCLUSIONS ARE BASED OF YOUR RETURN FROM
PLYMOUTH ALLOWING MUCH OF YOUR PROPERTY TO GO ON TO AFRICA I WILL
SAY NOTHING SAVE THAT IT FIRST INFORMED ME THAT YOU WERE ONE OF THE
FACTORS WHICH HAD TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN RECONSTRUCTING THIS
DRAMA
I CAME BACK
I HAVE HEARD YOUR REASONS AND REGARD THEM AS UNCONVINCING AND
INADEQUATE WE WILL PASS THAT YOU CAME DOWN HERE TO ASK ME WHOM I
SUSPECTED I REFUSED TO ANSWER YOU YOU THEN WENT TO THE VICARAGE
WAITED OUTSIDE IT FOR SOME TIME AND FINALLY RETURNED TO YOUR
COTTAGE
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
I FOLLOWED YOU
I SAW NO ONE
THAT IS WHAT YOU MAY EXPECT TO SEE WHEN I FOLLOW YOU YOU SPENT A
RESTLESS NIGHT AT YOUR COTTAGE AND YOU FORMED CERTAIN PLANS WHICH
IN THE EARLY MORNING YOU PROCEEDED TO PUT INTO EXECUTION LEAVING
YOUR DOOR JUST AS DAY WAS BREAKING YOU FILLED YOUR POCKET WITH SOME
REDDISH GRAVEL THAT WAS LYING HEAPED BESIDE YOUR GATE
STERNDALE GAVE A VIOLENT START AND LOOKED AT HOLMES IN AMAZEMENT
YOU THEN WALKED SWIFTLY FOR THE MILE WHICH SEPARATED YOU FROM THE
VICARAGE YOU WERE WEARING I MAY REMARK THE SAME PAIR OF RIBBED
TENNIS SHOES WHICH ARE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT UPON YOUR FEET AT THE
VICARAGE YOU PASSED THROUGH THE ORCHARD AND THE SIDE HEDGE COMING
OUT UNDER THE WINDOW OF THE LODGER TREGENNIS IT WAS NOW DAYLIGHT
BUT THE HOUSEHOLD WAS NOT YET STIRRING YOU DREW SOME OF THE GRAVEL
FROM YOUR POCKET AND YOU THREW IT UP AT THE WINDOW ABOVE YOU
STERNDALE SPRANG TO HIS FEET
I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE THE DEVIL HIMSELF HE CRIED
HOLMES SMILED AT THE COMPLIMENT IT TOOK TWO OR POSSIBLY THREE
HANDFULS BEFORE THE LODGER CAME TO THE WINDOW YOU BECKONED HIM TO
COME DOWN HE DRESSED HURRIEDLY AND DESCENDED TO HIS SITTINGROOM
YOU ENTERED BY THE WINDOW THERE WAS AN INTERVIEWA SHORT
ONEDURING WHICH YOU WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM THEN YOU PASSED
OUT AND CLOSED THE WINDOW STANDING ON THE LAWN OUTSIDE SMOKING A
CIGAR AND WATCHING WHAT OCCURRED FINALLY AFTER THE DEATH OF
TREGENNIS YOU WITHDREW AS YOU HAD COME NOW DR STERNDALE HOW DO
YOU JUSTIFY SUCH CONDUCT AND WHAT WERE THE MOTIVES FOR YOUR ACTIONS
IF YOU PREVARICATE OR TRIFLE WITH ME I GIVE YOU MY ASSURANCE THAT
THE MATTER WILL PASS OUT OF MY HANDS FOREVER
OUR VISITORS FACE HAD TURNED ASHEN GRAY AS HE LISTENED TO THE WORDS
OF HIS ACCUSER NOW HE SAT FOR SOME TIME IN THOUGHT WITH HIS FACE
SUNK IN HIS HANDS THEN WITH A SUDDEN IMPULSIVE GESTURE HE PLUCKED A
PHOTOGRAPH FROM HIS BREASTPOCKET AND THREW IT ON THE RUSTIC TABLE
BEFORE US
THAT IS WHY I HAVE DONE IT SAID HE
IT SHOWED THE BUST AND FACE OF A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN HOLMES STOOPED
OVER IT
BRENDA TREGENNIS SAID HE
YES BRENDA TREGENNIS REPEATED OUR VISITOR FOR YEARS I HAVE
LOVED HER FOR YEARS SHE HAS LOVED ME THERE IS THE SECRET OF THAT
CORNISH SECLUSION WHICH PEOPLE HAVE MARVELLED AT IT HAS BROUGHT ME
CLOSE TO THE ONE THING ON EARTH THAT WAS DEAR TO ME I COULD NOT
MARRY HER FOR I HAVE A WIFE WHO HAS LEFT ME FOR YEARS AND YET WHOM
BY THE DEPLORABLE LAWS OF ENGLAND I COULD NOT DIVORCE FOR YEARS
BRENDA WAITED FOR YEARS I WAITED AND THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE WAITED
FOR A TERRIBLE SOB SHOOK HIS GREAT FRAME AND HE CLUTCHED HIS
THROAT UNDER HIS BRINDLED BEARD THEN WITH AN EFFORT HE MASTERED
HIMSELF AND SPOKE ON
THE VICAR KNEW HE WAS IN OUR CONFIDENCE HE WOULD TELL YOU THAT SHE
WAS AN ANGEL UPON EARTH THAT WAS WHY HE TELEGRAPHED TO ME AND I
RETURNED WHAT WAS MY BAGGAGE OR AFRICA TO ME WHEN I LEARNED THAT
SUCH A FATE HAD COME UPON MY DARLING THERE YOU HAVE THE MISSING CLUE
TO MY ACTION MR HOLMES
PROCEED SAID MY FRIEND
DR STERNDALE DREW FROM HIS POCKET A PAPER PACKET AND LAID IT UPON
THE TABLE ON THE OUTSIDE WAS WRITTEN RADIX PEDIS DIABOLI WITH A
RED POISON LABEL BENEATH IT HE PUSHED IT TOWARDS ME I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU ARE A DOCTOR SIR HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THIS PREPARATION
DEVILSFOOT ROOT NO I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT
IT IS NO REFLECTION UPON YOUR PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE SAID HE FOR
I BELIEVE THAT SAVE FOR ONE SAMPLE IN A LABORATORY AT BUDA THERE IS
NO OTHER SPECIMEN IN EUROPE IT HAS NOT YET FOUND ITS WAY EITHER INTO
THE PHARMACOPOEIA OR INTO THE LITERATURE OF TOXICOLOGY THE ROOT IS
SHAPED LIKE A FOOT HALF HUMAN HALF GOATLIKE HENCE THE FANCIFUL
NAME GIVEN BY A BOTANICAL MISSIONARY IT IS USED AS AN ORDEAL POISON
BY THE MEDICINEMEN IN CERTAIN DISTRICTS OF WEST AFRICA AND IS KEPT
AS A SECRET AMONG THEM THIS PARTICULAR SPECIMEN I OBTAINED UNDER
VERY EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE UBANGI COUNTRY HE OPENED
THE PAPER AS HE SPOKE AND DISCLOSED A HEAP OF REDDISHBROWN
SNUFFLIKE POWDER
WELL SIR ASKED HOLMES STERNLY
I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU MR HOLMES ALL THAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED FOR
YOU ALREADY KNOW SO MUCH THAT IT IS CLEARLY TO MY INTEREST THAT YOU
SHOULD KNOW ALL I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED THE RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH I
STOOD TO THE TREGENNIS FAMILY FOR THE SAKE OF THE SISTER I WAS
FRIENDLY WITH THE BROTHERS THERE WAS A FAMILY QUARREL ABOUT MONEY
WHICH ESTRANGED THIS MAN MORTIMER BUT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MADE UP
AND I AFTERWARDS MET HIM AS I DID THE OTHERS HE WAS A SLY SUBTLE
SCHEMING MAN AND SEVERAL THINGS AROSE WHICH GAVE ME A SUSPICION OF
HIM BUT I HAD NO CAUSE FOR ANY POSITIVE QUARREL
ONE DAY ONLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO HE CAME DOWN TO MY COTTAGE AND
I SHOWED HIM SOME OF MY AFRICAN CURIOSITIES AMONG OTHER THINGS I
EXHIBITED THIS POWDER AND I TOLD HIM OF ITS STRANGE PROPERTIES HOW
IT STIMULATES THOSE BRAIN CENTRES WHICH CONTROL THE EMOTION OF FEAR
AND HOW EITHER MADNESS OR DEATH IS THE FATE OF THE UNHAPPY NATIVE WHO
IS SUBJECTED TO THE ORDEAL BY THE PRIEST OF HIS TRIBE I TOLD HIM
ALSO HOW POWERLESS EUROPEAN SCIENCE WOULD BE TO DETECT IT HOW HE
TOOK IT I CANNOT SAY FOR I NEVER LEFT THE ROOM BUT THERE IS NO
DOUBT THAT IT WAS THEN WHILE I WAS OPENING CABINETS AND STOOPING TO
BOXES THAT HE MANAGED TO ABSTRACT SOME OF THE DEVILSFOOT ROOT I
WELL REMEMBER HOW HE PLIED ME WITH QUESTIONS AS TO THE AMOUNT AND THE
TIME THAT WAS NEEDED FOR ITS EFFECT BUT I LITTLE DREAMED THAT HE
COULD HAVE A PERSONAL REASON FOR ASKING
I THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER UNTIL THE VICARS TELEGRAM REACHED
ME AT PLYMOUTH THIS VILLAIN HAD THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BE AT SEA
BEFORE THE NEWS COULD REACH ME AND THAT I SHOULD BE LOST FOR YEARS
IN AFRICA BUT I RETURNED AT ONCE OF COURSE I COULD NOT LISTEN TO
THE DETAILS WITHOUT FEELING ASSURED THAT MY POISON HAD BEEN USED I
CAME ROUND TO SEE YOU ON THE CHANCE THAT SOME OTHER EXPLANATION HAD
SUGGESTED ITSELF TO YOU BUT THERE COULD BE NONE I WAS CONVINCED
THAT MORTIMER TREGENNIS WAS THE MURDERER THAT FOR THE SAKE OF MONEY
AND WITH THE IDEA PERHAPS THAT IF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY
WERE ALL INSANE HE WOULD BE THE SOLE GUARDIAN OF THEIR JOINT
PROPERTY HE HAD USED THE DEVILSFOOT POWDER UPON THEM DRIVEN TWO
OF THEM OUT OF THEIR SENSES AND KILLED HIS SISTER BRENDA THE ONE
HUMAN BEING WHOM I HAVE EVER LOVED OR WHO HAS EVER LOVED ME THERE
WAS HIS CRIME WHAT WAS TO BE HIS PUNISHMENT
SHOULD I APPEAL TO THE LAW WHERE WERE MY PROOFS I KNEW THAT THE
FACTS WERE TRUE BUT COULD I HELP TO MAKE A JURY OF COUNTRYMEN
BELIEVE SO FANTASTIC A STORY I MIGHT OR I MIGHT NOT BUT I COULD NOT
AFFORD TO FAIL MY SOUL CRIED OUT FOR REVENGE I HAVE SAID TO YOU
ONCE BEFORE MR HOLMES THAT I HAVE SPENT MUCH OF MY LIFE OUTSIDE
THE LAW AND THAT I HAVE COME AT LAST TO BE A LAW TO MYSELF SO IT
WAS EVEN NOW I DETERMINED THAT THE FATE WHICH HE HAD GIVEN TO OTHERS
SHOULD BE SHARED BY HIMSELF EITHER THAT OR I WOULD DO JUSTICE UPON
HIM WITH MY OWN HAND IN ALL ENGLAND THERE CAN BE NO MAN WHO SETS
LESS VALUE UPON HIS OWN LIFE THAN I DO AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
NOW I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL YOU HAVE YOURSELF SUPPLIED THE REST I DID
AS YOU SAY AFTER A RESTLESS NIGHT SET OFF EARLY FROM MY COTTAGE I
FORESAW THE DIFFICULTY OF AROUSING HIM SO I GATHERED SOME GRAVEL
FROM THE PILE WHICH YOU HAVE MENTIONED AND I USED IT TO THROW UP TO
HIS WINDOW HE CAME DOWN AND ADMITTED ME THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE
SITTINGROOM I LAID HIS OFFENCE BEFORE HIM I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD
COME BOTH AS JUDGE AND EXECUTIONER THE WRETCH SANK INTO A CHAIR
PARALYZED AT THE SIGHT OF MY REVOLVER I LIT THE LAMP PUT THE POWDER
ABOVE IT AND STOOD OUTSIDE THE WINDOW READY TO CARRY OUT MY THREAT
TO SHOOT HIM SHOULD HE TRY TO LEAVE THE ROOM IN FIVE MINUTES HE
DIED MY GOD HOW HE DIED BUT MY HEART WAS FLINT FOR HE ENDURED
NOTHING WHICH MY INNOCENT DARLING HAD NOT FELT BEFORE HIM THERE IS
MY STORY MR HOLMES PERHAPS IF YOU LOVED A WOMAN YOU WOULD HAVE
DONE AS MUCH YOURSELF AT ANY RATE I AM IN YOUR HANDS YOU CAN TAKE
WHAT STEPS YOU LIKE AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THERE IS NO MAN LIVING
WHO CAN FEAR DEATH LESS THAN I DO
HOLMES SAT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME IN SILENCE
WHAT WERE YOUR PLANS HE ASKED AT LAST
I HAD INTENDED TO BURY MYSELF IN CENTRAL AFRICA MY WORK THERE IS
BUT HALF FINISHED
GO AND DO THE OTHER HALF SAID HOLMES I AT LEAST AM NOT
PREPARED TO PREVENT YOU
DR STERNDALE RAISED HIS GIANT FIGURE BOWED GRAVELY AND WALKED FROM
THE ARBOUR HOLMES LIT HIS PIPE AND HANDED ME HIS POUCH
SOME FUMES WHICH ARE NOT POISONOUS WOULD BE A WELCOME CHANGE SAID
HE I THINK YOU MUST AGREE WATSON THAT IT IS NOT A CASE IN WHICH
WE ARE CALLED UPON TO INTERFERE OUR INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN
INDEPENDENT AND OUR ACTION SHALL BE SO ALSO YOU WOULD NOT DENOUNCE
THE MAN
CERTAINLY NOT I ANSWERED
I HAVE NEVER LOVED WATSON BUT IF I DID AND IF THE WOMAN I LOVED
HAD MET SUCH AN END I MIGHT ACT EVEN AS OUR LAWLESS LIONHUNTER HAS
DONE WHO KNOWS WELL WATSON I WILL NOT OFFEND YOUR INTELLIGENCE BY
EXPLAINING WHAT IS OBVIOUS THE GRAVEL UPON THE WINDOWSILL WAS OF
COURSE THE STARTINGPOINT OF MY RESEARCH IT WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING IN
THE VICARAGE GARDEN ONLY WHEN MY ATTENTION HAD BEEN DRAWN TO DR
STERNDALE AND HIS COTTAGE DID I FIND ITS COUNTERPART THE LAMP
SHINING IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AND THE REMAINS OF POWDER UPON THE SHIELD
WERE SUCCESSIVE LINKS IN A FAIRLY OBVIOUS CHAIN AND NOW MY DEAR
WATSON I THINK WE MAY DISMISS THE MATTER FROM OUR MIND AND GO BACK
WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE TO THE STUDY OF THOSE CHALDEAN ROOTS WHICH
ARE SURELY TO BE TRACED IN THE CORNISH BRANCH OF THE GREAT CELTIC
SPEECH
HIS LAST BOW
AN EPILOGUE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
IT WAS NINE OCLOCK AT NIGHT UPON THE SECOND OF AUGUSTTHE MOST
TERRIBLE AUGUST IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT
ALREADY THAT GODS CURSE HUNG HEAVY OVER A DEGENERATE WORLD FOR
THERE WAS AN AWESOME HUSH AND A FEELING OF VAGUE EXPECTANCY IN THE
SULTRY AND STAGNANT AIR THE SUN HAD LONG SET BUT ONE BLOODRED GASH
LIKE AN OPEN WOUND LAY LOW IN THE DISTANT WEST ABOVE THE STARS WERE
SHINING BRIGHTLY AND BELOW THE LIGHTS OF THE SHIPPING GLIMMERED IN
THE BAY THE TWO FAMOUS GERMANS STOOD BESIDE THE STONE PARAPET OF THE
GARDEN WALK WITH THE LONG LOW HEAVILY GABLED HOUSE BEHIND THEM
AND THEY LOOKED DOWN UPON THE BROAD SWEEP OF THE BEACH AT THE FOOT OF
THE GREAT CHALK CLIFF IN WHICH VON BORK LIKE SOME WANDERING EAGLE
HAD PERCHED HIMSELF FOUR YEARS BEFORE THEY STOOD WITH THEIR HEADS
CLOSE TOGETHER TALKING IN LOW CONFIDENTIAL TONES FROM BELOW THE
TWO GLOWING ENDS OF THEIR CIGARS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SMOULDERING EYES
OF SOME MALIGNANT FIEND LOOKING DOWN IN THE DARKNESS
A REMARKABLE MAN THIS VON BORKA MAN WHO COULD HARDLY BE MATCHED
AMONG ALL THE DEVOTED AGENTS OF THE KAISER IT WAS HIS TALENTS WHICH
HAD FIRST RECOMMENDED HIM FOR THE ENGLISH MISSION THE MOST IMPORTANT
MISSION OF ALL BUT SINCE HE HAD TAKEN IT OVER THOSE TALENTS HAD
BECOME MORE AND MORE MANIFEST TO THE HALFDOZEN PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
WHO WERE REALLY IN TOUCH WITH THE TRUTH ONE OF THESE WAS HIS PRESENT
COMPANION BARON VON HERLING THE CHIEF SECRETARY OF THE LEGATION
WHOSE HUGE HORSEPOWER BENZ CAR WAS BLOCKING THE COUNTRY LANE AS
IT WAITED TO WAFT ITS OWNER BACK TO LONDON
SO FAR AS I CAN JUDGE THE TREND OF EVENTS YOU WILL PROBABLY BE BACK
IN BERLIN WITHIN THE WEEK THE SECRETARY WAS SAYING WHEN YOU GET
THERE MY DEAR VON BORK I THINK YOU WILL BE SURPRISED AT THE WELCOME
YOU WILL RECEIVE I HAPPEN TO KNOW WHAT IS THOUGHT IN THE HIGHEST
QUARTERS OF YOUR WORK IN THIS COUNTRY HE WAS A HUGE MAN THE
SECRETARY DEEP BROAD AND TALL WITH A SLOW HEAVY FASHION OF
SPEECH WHICH HAD BEEN HIS MAIN ASSET IN HIS POLITICAL CAREER
VON BORK LAUGHED
THEY ARE NOT VERY HARD TO DECEIVE HE REMARKED A MORE DOCILE
SIMPLE FOLK COULD NOT BE IMAGINED
I DONT KNOW ABOUT THAT SAID THE OTHER THOUGHTFULLY THEY HAVE
STRANGE LIMITS AND ONE MUST LEARN TO OBSERVE THEM IT IS THAT SURFACE
SIMPLICITY OF THEIRS WHICH MAKES A TRAP FOR THE STRANGER ONES FIRST
IMPRESSION IS THAT THEY ARE ENTIRELY SOFT THEN ONE COMES SUDDENLY
UPON SOMETHING VERY HARD AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE REACHED THE
LIMIT AND MUST ADAPT YOURSELF TO THE FACT THEY HAVE FOR EXAMPLE
THEIR INSULAR CONVENTIONS WHICH SIMPLY MUST BE OBSERVED
MEANING GOOD FORM AND THAT SORT OF THING VON BORK SIGHED AS ONE
WHO HAD SUFFERED MUCH
MEANING BRITISH PREJUDICE IN ALL ITS QUEER MANIFESTATIONS AS AN
EXAMPLE I MAY QUOTE ONE OF MY OWN WORST BLUNDERSI CAN AFFORD TO
TALK OF MY BLUNDERS FOR YOU KNOW MY WORK WELL ENOUGH TO BE AWARE OF
MY SUCCESSES IT WAS ON MY FIRST ARRIVAL I WAS INVITED TO A WEEKEND
GATHERING AT THE COUNTRY HOUSE OF A CABINET MINISTER THE
CONVERSATION WAS AMAZINGLY INDISCREET
VON BORK NODDED IVE BEEN THERE SAID HE DRYLY
EXACTLY WELL I NATURALLY SENT A RESUME OF THE INFORMATION TO
BERLIN UNFORTUNATELY OUR GOOD CHANCELLOR IS A LITTLE HEAVYHANDED IN
THESE MATTERS AND HE TRANSMITTED A REMARK WHICH SHOWED THAT HE WAS
AWARE OF WHAT HAD BEEN SAID THIS OF COURSE TOOK THE TRAIL STRAIGHT
UP TO ME YOUVE NO IDEA THE HARM THAT IT DID ME THERE WAS NOTHING
SOFT ABOUT OUR BRITISH HOSTS ON THAT OCCASION I CAN ASSURE YOU I
WAS TWO YEARS LIVING IT DOWN NOW YOU WITH THIS SPORTING POSE OF
YOURS
NO NO DONT CALL IT A POSE A POSE IS AN ARTIFICIAL THING THIS IS
QUITE NATURAL I AM A BORN SPORTSMAN I ENJOY IT
WELL THAT MAKES IT THE MORE EFFECTIVE YOU YACHT AGAINST THEM YOU
HUNT WITH THEM YOU PLAY POLO YOU MATCH THEM IN EVERY GAME YOUR
FOURINHAND TAKES THE PRIZE AT OLYMPIA I HAVE EVEN HEARD THAT YOU
GO THE LENGTH OF BOXING WITH THE YOUNG OFFICERS WHAT IS THE RESULT
NOBODY TAKES YOU SERIOUSLY YOU ARE A GOOD OLD SPORT QUITE A
DECENT FELLOW FOR A GERMAN A HARDDRINKING NIGHTCLUB
KNOCKABOUTTOWN DEVILMAYCARE YOUNG FELLOW AND ALL THE TIME THIS
QUIET COUNTRY HOUSE OF YOURS IS THE CENTRE OF HALF THE MISCHIEF IN
ENGLAND AND THE SPORTING SQUIRE THE MOST ASTUTE SECRETSERVICE MAN
IN EUROPE GENIUS MY DEAR VON BORKGENIUS
YOU FLATTER ME BARON BUT CERTAINLY I MAY CLAIM MY FOUR YEARS IN
THIS COUNTRY HAVE NOT BEEN UNPRODUCTIVE IVE NEVER SHOWN YOU MY
LITTLE STORE WOULD YOU MIND STEPPING IN FOR A MOMENT
THE DOOR OF THE STUDY OPENED STRAIGHT ON TO THE TERRACE VON BORK
PUSHED IT BACK AND LEADING THE WAY HE CLICKED THE SWITCH OF THE
ELECTRIC LIGHT HE THEN CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THE BULKY FORM WHICH
FOLLOWED HIM AND CAREFULLY ADJUSTED THE HEAVY CURTAIN OVER THE
LATTICED WINDOW ONLY WHEN ALL THESE PRECAUTIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN AND
TESTED DID HE TURN HIS SUNBURNED AQUILINE FACE TO HIS GUEST
SOME OF MY PAPERS HAVE GONE SAID HE WHEN MY WIFE AND THE
HOUSEHOLD LEFT YESTERDAY FOR FLUSHING THEY TOOK THE LESS IMPORTANT
WITH THEM I MUST OF COURSE CLAIM THE PROTECTION OF THE EMBASSY FOR
THE OTHERS
YOUR NAME HAS ALREADY BEEN FILED AS ONE OF THE PERSONAL SUITE THERE
WILL BE NO DIFFICULTIES FOR YOU OR YOUR BAGGAGE OF COURSE IT IS
JUST POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE TO GO ENGLAND MAY LEAVE FRANCE TO
HER FATE WE ARE SURE THAT THERE IS NO BINDING TREATY BETWEEN THEM
AND BELGIUM
YES AND BELGIUM TOO
VON BORK SHOOK HIS HEAD I DONT SEE HOW THAT COULD BE THERE IS A
DEFINITE TREATY THERE SHE COULD NEVER RECOVER FROM SUCH A
HUMILIATION
SHE WOULD AT LEAST HAVE PEACE FOR THE MOMENT
BUT HER HONOR
TUT MY DEAR SIR WE LIVE IN A UTILITARIAN AGE HONOUR IS A
MEDIAEVAL CONCEPTION BESIDES ENGLAND IS NOT READY IT IS AN
INCONCEIVABLE THING BUT EVEN OUR SPECIAL WAR TAX OF FIFTY MILLION
WHICH ONE WOULD THINK MADE OUR PURPOSE AS CLEAR AS IF WE HAD
ADVERTISED IT ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES HAS NOT ROUSED THESE
PEOPLE FROM THEIR SLUMBERS HERE AND THERE ONE HEARS A QUESTION IT
IS MY BUSINESS TO FIND AN ANSWER HERE AND THERE ALSO THERE IS AN
IRRITATION IT IS MY BUSINESS TO SOOTHE IT BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT
SO FAR AS THE ESSENTIALS GOTHE STORAGE OF MUNITIONS THE
PREPARATION FOR SUBMARINE ATTACK THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MAKING HIGH
EXPLOSIVESNOTHING IS PREPARED HOW THEN CAN ENGLAND COME IN
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE STIRRED HER UP SUCH A DEVILS BREW OF IRISH
CIVIL WAR WINDOWBREAKING FURIES AND GOD KNOWS WHAT TO KEEP HER
THOUGHTS AT HOME
SHE MUST THINK OF HER FUTURE
AH THAT IS ANOTHER MATTER I FANCY THAT IN THE FUTURE WE HAVE OUR
OWN VERY DEFINITE PLANS ABOUT ENGLAND AND THAT YOUR INFORMATION WILL
BE VERY VITAL TO US IT IS TODAY OR TOMORROW WITH MR JOHN BULL IF
HE PREFERS TODAY WE ARE PERFECTLY READY IF IT IS TOMORROW WE SHALL
BE MORE READY STILL I SHOULD THINK THEY WOULD BE WISER TO FIGHT WITH
ALLIES THAN WITHOUT THEM BUT THAT IS THEIR OWN AFFAIR THIS WEEK IS
THEIR WEEK OF DESTINY BUT YOU WERE SPEAKING OF YOUR PAPERS HE SAT
IN THE ARMCHAIR WITH THE LIGHT SHINING UPON HIS BROAD BALD HEAD
WHILE HE PUFFED SEDATELY AT HIS CIGAR
THE LARGE OAKPANELLED BOOKLINED ROOM HAD A CURTAIN HUNG IN THE
FUTURE CORNER WHEN THIS WAS DRAWN IT DISCLOSED A LARGE BRASSBOUND
SAFE VON BORK DETACHED A SMALL KEY FROM HIS WATCH CHAIN AND AFTER
SOME CONSIDERABLE MANIPULATION OF THE LOCK HE SWUNG OPEN THE HEAVY
DOOR
LOOK SAID HE STANDING CLEAR WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND
THE LIGHT SHONE VIVIDLY INTO THE OPENED SAFE AND THE SECRETARY OF
THE EMBASSY GAZED WITH AN ABSORBED INTEREST AT THE ROWS OF STUFFED
PIGEONHOLES WITH WHICH IT WAS FURNISHED EACH PIGEONHOLE HAD ITS
LABEL AND HIS EYES AS HE GLANCED ALONG THEM READ A LONG SERIES OF
SUCH TITLES AS FORDS HARBOURDEFENCES AEROPLANES IRELAND
EGYPT PORTSMOUTH FORTS THE CHANNEL ROSYTHE AND A SCORE OF
OTHERS EACH COMPARTMENT WAS BRISTLING WITH PAPERS AND PLANS
COLOSSAL SAID THE SECRETARY PUTTING DOWN HIS CIGAR HE SOFTLY
CLAPPED HIS FAT HANDS
AND ALL IN FOUR YEARS BARON NOT SUCH A BAD SHOW FOR THE
HARDDRINKING HARDRIDING COUNTRY SQUIRE BUT THE GEM OF MY
COLLECTION IS COMING AND THERE IS THE SETTING ALL READY FOR IT HE
POINTED TO A SPACE OVER WHICH NAVAL SIGNALS WAS PRINTED
BUT YOU HAVE A GOOD DOSSIER THERE ALREADY
OUT OF DATE AND WASTE PAPER THE ADMIRALTY IN SOME WAY GOT THE ALARM
AND EVERY CODE HAS BEEN CHANGED IT WAS A BLOW BARONTHE WORST
SETBACK IN MY WHOLE CAMPAIGN BUT THANKS TO MY CHECKBOOK AND THE
GOOD ALTAMONT ALL WILL BE WELL TONIGHT
THE BARON LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND GAVE A GUTTURAL EXCLAMATION OF
DISAPPOINTMENT
WELL I REALLY CAN WAIT NO LONGER YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THINGS ARE
MOVING AT PRESENT IN CARLTON TERRACE AND THAT WE HAVE ALL TO BE AT
OUR POSTS I HAD HOPED TO BE ABLE TO BRING NEWS OF YOUR GREAT COUP
DID ALTAMONT NAME NO HOUR
VON BORK PUSHED OVER A TELEGRAM
WILL COME WITHOUT FAIL TONIGHT AND BRING NEW SPARKING PLUGS
ALTAMONT
SPARKING PLUGS EH
YOU SEE HE POSES AS A MOTOR EXPERT AND I KEEP A FULL GARAGE IN OUR
CODE EVERYTHING LIKELY TO COME UP IS NAMED AFTER SOME SPARE PART IF
HE TALKS OF A RADIATOR IT IS A BATTLESHIP OF AN OIL PUMP A CRUISER
AND SO ON SPARKING PLUGS ARE NAVAL SIGNALS
FROM PORTSMOUTH AT MIDDAY SAID THE SECRETARY EXAMINING THE
SUPERSCRIPTION BY THE WAY WHAT DO YOU GIVE HIM
FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS FOR THIS PARTICULAR JOB OF COURSE HE HAS A
SALARY AS WELL
THE GREEDY ROUGE THEY ARE USEFUL THESE TRAITORS BUT I GRUDGE THEM
THEIR BLOOD MONEY
I GRUDGE ALTAMONT NOTHING HE IS A WONDERFUL WORKER IF I PAY HIM
WELL AT LEAST HE DELIVERS THE GOODS TO USE HIS OWN PHRASE BESIDES
HE IS NOT A TRAITOR I ASSURE YOU THAT OUR MOST PANGERMANIC JUNKER
IS A SUCKING DOVE IN HIS FEELINGS TOWARDS ENGLAND AS COMPARED WITH A
REAL BITTER IRISHAMERICAN
OH AN IRISHAMERICAN
IF YOU HEARD HIM TALK YOU WOULD NOT DOUBT IT SOMETIMES I ASSURE YOU
I CAN HARDLY UNDERSTAND HIM HE SEEMS TO HAVE DECLARED WAR ON THE
KINGS ENGLISH AS WELL AS ON THE ENGLISH KING MUST YOU REALLY GO HE
MAY BE HERE ANY MOMENT
NO IM SORRY BUT I HAVE ALREADY OVERSTAYED MY TIME WE SHALL
EXPECT YOU EARLY TOMORROW AND WHEN YOU GET THAT SIGNAL BOOK THROUGH
THE LITTLE DOOR ON THE DUKE OF YORKS STEPS YOU CAN PUT A TRIUMPHANT
FINIS TO YOUR RECORD IN ENGLAND WHAT TOKAY HE INDICATED A HEAVILY
SEALED DUSTCOVERED BOTTLE WHICH STOOD WITH TWO HIGH GLASSES UPON A
SALVER
MAY I OFFER YOU A GLASS BEFORE YOUR JOURNEY
NO THANKS BUT IT LOOKS LIKE REVELRY
ALTAMONT HAS A NICE TASTE IN WINES AND HE TOOK A FANCY TO MY TOKAY
HE IS A TOUCHY FELLOW AND NEEDS HUMOURING IN SMALL THINGS I HAVE TO
STUDY HIM I ASSURE YOU THEY HAD STROLLED OUT ON TO THE TERRACE
AGAIN AND ALONG IT TO THE FURTHER END WHERE AT A TOUCH FROM THE
BARONS CHAUFFEUR THE GREAT CAR SHIVERED AND CHUCKLED THOSE ARE THE
LIGHTS OF HARWICH I SUPPOSE SAID THE SECRETARY PULLING ON HIS
DUST COAT HOW STILL AND PEACEFUL IT ALL SEEMS THERE MAY BE OTHER
LIGHTS WITHIN THE WEEK AND THE ENGLISH COAST A LESS TRANQUIL PLACE
THE HEAVENS TOO MAY NOT BE QUITE SO PEACEFUL IF ALL THAT THE GOOD
ZEPPELIN PROMISES US COMES TRUE BY THE WAY WHO IS THAT
ONLY ONE WINDOW SHOWED A LIGHT BEHIND THEM IN IT THERE STOOD A LAMP
AND BESIDE IT SEATED AT A TABLE WAS A DEAR OLD RUDDYFACED WOMAN IN
A COUNTRY CAP SHE WAS BENDING OVER HER KNITTING AND STOPPING
OCCASIONALLY TO STROKE A LARGE BLACK CAT UPON A STOOL BESIDE HER
THAT IS MARTHA THE ONLY SERVANT I HAVE LEFT
THE SECRETARY CHUCKLED
SHE MIGHT ALMOST PERSONIFY BRITANNIA SAID HE WITH HER COMPLETE
SELFABSORPTION AND GENERAL AIR OF COMFORTABLE SOMNOLENCE WELL AU
REVOIR VON BORK WITH A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND HE SPRANG INTO THE
CAR AND A MOMENT LATER THE TWO GOLDEN CONES FROM THE HEADLIGHTS SHOT
THROUGH THE DARKNESS THE SECRETARY LAY BACK IN THE CUSHIONS OF THE
LUXURIOUS LIMOUSINE WITH HIS THOUGHTS SO FULL OF THE IMPENDING
EUROPEAN TRAGEDY THAT HE HARDLY OBSERVED THAT AS HIS CAR SWUNG ROUND
THE VILLAGE STREET IT NEARLY PASSED OVER A LITTLE FORD COMING IN THE
OPPOSITE DIRECTION
VON BORK WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE STUDY WHEN THE LAST GLEAMS OF THE
MOTOR LAMPS HAD FADED INTO THE DISTANCE AS HE PASSED HE OBSERVED
THAT HIS OLD HOUSEKEEPER HAD PUT OUT HER LAMP AND RETIRED IT WAS A
NEW EXPERIENCE TO HIM THE SILENCE AND DARKNESS OF HIS WIDESPREAD
HOUSE FOR HIS FAMILY AND HOUSEHOLD HAD BEEN A LARGE ONE IT WAS A
RELIEF TO HIM HOWEVER TO THINK THAT THEY WERE ALL IN SAFETY AND
THAT BUT FOR THAT ONE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD LINGERED IN THE KITCHEN HE
HAD THE WHOLE PLACE TO HIMSELF THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF TIDYING UP
TO DO INSIDE HIS STUDY AND HE SET HIMSELF TO DO IT UNTIL HIS KEEN
HANDSOME FACE WAS FLUSHED WITH THE HEAT OF THE BURNING PAPERS A
LEATHER VALISE STOOD BESIDE HIS TABLE AND INTO THIS HE BEGAN TO PACK
VERY NEATLY AND SYSTEMATICALLY THE PRECIOUS CONTENTS OF HIS SAFE HE
HAD HARDLY GOT STARTED WITH THE WORK HOWEVER WHEN HIS QUICK EARS
CAUGHT THE SOUNDS OF A DISTANT CAR INSTANTLY HE GAVE AN EXCLAMATION
OF SATISFACTION STRAPPED UP THE VALISE SHUT THE SAFE LOCKED IT
AND HURRIED OUT ON TO THE TERRACE HE WAS JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE
LIGHTS OF A SMALL CAR COME TO A HALT AT THE GATE A PASSENGER SPRANG
OUT OF IT AND ADVANCED SWIFTLY TOWARDS HIM WHILE THE CHAUFFEUR A
HEAVILY BUILT ELDERLY MAN WITH A GRAY MOUSTACHE SETTLED DOWN LIKE
ONE WHO RESIGNS HIMSELF TO A LONG VIGIL
WELL ASKED VON BORK EAGERLY RUNNING FORWARD TO MEET HIS VISITOR
FOR ANSWER THE MAN WAVED A SMALL BROWNPAPER PARCEL TRIUMPHANTLY
ABOVE HIS HEAD
YOU CAN GIVE ME THE GLAD HAND TONIGHT MISTER HE CRIED IM
BRINGING HOME THE BACON AT LAST
THE SIGNALS
SAME AS I SAID IN MY CABLE EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM SEMAPHORE LAMP
CODE MARCONIA COPY MIND YOU NOT THE ORIGINAL THAT WAS TOO
DANGEROUS BUT ITS THE REAL GOODS AND YOU CAN LAY TO THAT HE
SLAPPED THE GERMAN UPON THE SHOULDER WITH A ROUGH FAMILIARITY FROM
WHICH THE OTHER WINCED
COME IN HE SAID IM ALL ALONE IN THE HOUSE I WAS ONLY WAITING
FOR THIS OF COURSE A COPY IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL IF AN
ORIGINAL WERE MISSING THEY WOULD CHANGE THE WHOLE THING YOU THINK
ITS ALL SAFE ABOUT THE COPY
THE IRISHAMERICAN HAD ENTERED THE STUDY AND STRETCHED HIS LONG LIMBS
FROM THE ARMCHAIR HE WAS A TALL GAUNT MAN OF SIXTY WITH CLEARCUT
FEATURES AND A SMALL GOATEE BEARD WHICH GAVE HIM A GENERAL
RESEMBLANCE TO THE CARICATURES OF UNCLE SAM A HALFSMOKED SODDEN
CIGAR HUNG FROM THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH AND AS HE SAT DOWN HE STRUCK
A MATCH AND RELIT IT MAKING READY FOR A MOVE HE REMARKED AS HE
LOOKED ROUND HIM SAY MISTER HE ADDED AS HIS EYES FELL UPON THE
SAFE FROM WHICH THE CURTAIN WAS NOW REMOVED YOU DONT TELL ME YOU
KEEP YOUR PAPERS IN THAT
WHY NOT
GOSH IN A WIDEOPEN CONTRAPTION LIKE THAT AND THEY RECKON YOU TO
BE SOME SPY WHY A YANKEE CROOK WOULD BE INTO THAT WITH A
CANOPENER IF ID KNOWN THAT ANY LETTER OF MINE WAS GOIN TO LIE
LOOSE IN A THING LIKE THAT ID HAVE BEEN A MUG TO WRITE TO YOU AT
ALL
IT WOULD PUZZLE ANY CROOK TO FORCE THAT SAFE VON BORK ANSWERED
YOU WONT CUT THAT METAL WITH ANY TOOL
BUT THE LOCK
NO ITS A DOUBLE COMBINATION LOCK YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS
SEARCH ME SAID THE AMERICAN
WELL YOU NEED A WORD AS WELL AS A SET OF FIGURES BEFORE YOU CAN GET
THE LOCK TO WORK HE ROSE AND SHOWED A DOUBLERADIATING DISC ROUND
THE KEYHOLE THIS OUTER ONE IS FOR THE LETTERS THE INNER ONE FOR
THE FIGURES
WELL WELL THATS FINE
SO ITS NOT QUITE AS SIMPLE AS YOU THOUGHT IT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO
THAT I HAD IT MADE AND WHAT DO YOU THINK I CHOSE FOR THE WORD AND

IT WAS JAMESS OWN FAULT YOU KNOW THAT YOURSELF HE WAS TOO
SELFWILLED FOR THE JOB
JAMES WAS A BONEHEADI GIVE YOU THAT THEN THERE WAS HOLLIS

BUGHOUSE WHEN HE HAS TO PLAY A PART FROM MORNING TO NIGHT WITH A
HUNDRED GUYS ALL READY TO SET THE COPPERS WISE TO HIM BUT NOW THERE

VON BORK STARTED VIOLENTLY AND HIS RUDDY FACE TURNED A SHADE PALER
WHAT ABOUT STEINER
WELL THEYVE GOT HIM THATS ALL THEY RAIDED HIS STORE LAST NIGHT
AND HE AND HIS PAPERS ARE ALL IN PORTSMOUTH JAIL YOULL GO OFF AND
HE POOR DEVIL WILL HAVE TO STAND THE RACKET AND LUCKY IF HE GETS
OFF WITH HIS LIFE THATS WHY I WANT TO GET OVER THE WATER AS SOON AS
YOU DO
VON BORK WAS A STRONG SELFCONTAINED MAN BUT IT WAS EASY TO SEE
THAT THE NEWS HAD SHAKEN HIM
HOW COULD THEY HAVE GOT ON TO STEINER HE MUTTERED THATS THE
WORST BLOW YET
WELL YOU NEARLY HAD A WORSE ONE FOR I BELIEVE THEY ARE NOT FAR OFF
ME
YOU DONT MEAN THAT
SURE THING MY LANDLADY DOWN FRATTON WAY HAD SOME INQUIRIES AND
WHEN I HEARD OF IT I GUESSED IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO HUSTLE BUT WHAT I
WANT TO KNOW MISTER IS HOW THE COPPERS KNOW THESE THINGS STEINER

THE NAME OF THE SIXTH IF I DONT GET A MOVE ON HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
IT AND AINT YOU ASHAMED TO SEE YOUR MEN GO DOWN LIKE THIS
VON BORK FLUSHED CRIMSON
HOW DARE YOU SPEAK IN SUCH A WAY
IF I DIDNT DARE THINGS MISTER I WOULDNT BE IN YOUR SERVICE BUT
ILL TELL YOU STRAIGHT WHAT IS IN MY MIND IVE HEARD THAT WITH YOU
GERMAN POLITICIANS WHEN AN AGENT HAS DONE HIS WORK YOU ARE NOT SORRY
TO SEE HIM PUT AWAY
VON BORK SPRANG TO HIS FEET
DO YOU DARE TO SUGGEST THAT I HAVE GIVEN AWAY MY OWN AGENTS
I DONT STAND FOR THAT MISTER BUT THERES A STOOL PIGEON OR A
CROSS SOMEWHERE AND ITS UP TO YOU TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS ANYHOW I
AM TAKING NO MORE CHANCES ITS ME FOR LITTLE HOLLAND AND THE SOONER
THE BETTER
VON BORK HAD MASTERED HIS ANGER
WE HAVE BEEN ALLIES TOO LONG TO QUARREL NOW AT THE VERY HOUR OF
VICTORY HE SAID YOUVE DONE SPLENDID WORK AND TAKEN RISKS AND I
CANT FORGET IT BY ALL MEANS GO TO HOLLAND AND YOU CAN GET A BOAT
FROM ROTTERDAM TO NEW YORK NO OTHER LINE WILL BE SAFE A WEEK FROM

THE LAST AND I HAD TO SQUARE HIM WITH AN EXTRA HUNDRED DOLLARS OR IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN NITSKY FOR YOU AND ME NOTHIN DOIN SAYS HE AND
HE MEANT IT TOO BUT THE LAST HUNDRED DID IT ITS COST ME TWO
HUNDRED POUND FROM FIRST TO LAST SO IT ISNT LIKELY ID GIVE IT UP
WITHOUT GETTIN MY WAD
VON BORK SMILED WITH SOME BITTERNESS YOU DONT SEEM TO HAVE A VERY
HIGH OPINION OF MY HONOUR SAID HE YOU WANT THE MONEY BEFORE YOU
GIVE UP THE BOOK
WELL MISTER IT IS A BUSINESS PROPOSITION
ALL RIGHT HAVE YOUR WAY HE SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND SCRIBBLED A
CHECK WHICH HE TORE FROM THE BOOK BUT HE REFRAINED FROM HANDING IT
TO HIS COMPANION AFTER ALL SINCE WE ARE TO BE ON SUCH TERMS MR
ALTAMONT SAID HE I DONT SEE WHY I SHOULD TRUST YOU ANY MORE THAN
YOU TRUST ME DO YOU UNDERSTAND HE ADDED LOOKING BACK OVER HIS
SHOULDER AT THE AMERICAN THERES THE CHECK UPON THE TABLE I CLAIM
THE RIGHT TO EXAMINE THAT PARCEL BEFORE YOU PICK THE MONEY UP
THE AMERICAN PASSED IT OVER WITHOUT A WORD VON BORK UNDID A WINDING
OF STRING AND TWO WRAPPERS OF PAPER THEN HE SAT DAZING FOR A MOMENT
IN SILENT AMAZEMENT AT A SMALL BLUE BOOK WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM ACROSS
THE COVER WAS PRINTED IN GOLDEN LETTERS PRACTICAL HANDBOOK OF BEE
CULTURE ONLY FOR ONE INSTANT DID THE MASTER SPY GLARE AT THIS
STRANGELY IRRELEVANT INSCRIPTION THE NEXT HE WAS GRIPPED AT THE BACK
OF HIS NECK BY A GRASP OF IRON AND A CHLOROFORMED SPONGE WAS HELD IN
FRONT OF HIS WRITHING FACE
ANOTHER GLASS WATSON SAID MR SHERLOCK HOLMES AS HE EXTENDED THE
BOTTLE OF IMPERIAL TOKAY
THE THICKSET CHAUFFEUR WHO HAD SEATED HIMSELF BY THE TABLE PUSHED
FORWARD HIS GLASS WITH SOME EAGERNESS
IT IS A GOOD WINE HOLMES
A REMARKABLE WINE WATSON OUR FRIEND UPON THE SOFA HAS ASSURED ME
THAT IT IS FROM FRANZ JOSEFS SPECIAL CELLAR AT THE SCHOENBRUNN
PALACE MIGHT I TROUBLE YOU TO OPEN THE WINDOW FOR CHLOROFORM VAPOUR
DOES NOT HELP THE PALATE
THE SAFE WAS AJAR AND HOLMES STANDING IN FRONT OF IT WAS REMOVING
DOSSIER AFTER DOSSIER SWIFTLY EXAMINING EACH AND THEN PACKING IT
NEATLY IN VON BORKS VALISE THE GERMAN LAY UPON THE SOFA SLEEPING
STERTOROUSLY WITH A STRAP ROUND HIS UPPER ARMS AND ANOTHER ROUND HIS
LEGS
WE NEED NOT HURRY OURSELVES WATSON WE ARE SAFE FROM INTERRUPTION
WOULD YOU MIND TOUCHING THE BELL THERE IS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE EXCEPT
OLD MARTHA WHO HAS PLAYED HER PART TO ADMIRATION I GOT HER THE
SITUATION HERE WHEN FIRST I TOOK THE MATTER UP AH MARTHA YOU WILL
BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT ALL IS WELL
THE PLEASANT OLD LADY HAD APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SHE CURTSEYED WITH
A SMILE TO MR HOLMES BUT GLANCED WITH SOME APPREHENSION AT THE
FIGURE UPON THE SOFA
IT IS ALL RIGHT MARTHA HE HAS NOT BEEN HURT AT ALL
I AM GLAD OF THAT MR HOLMES ACCORDING TO HIS LIGHTS HE HAS BEEN A
KIND MASTER HE WANTED ME TO GO WITH HIS WIFE TO GERMANY YESTERDAY
BUT THAT WOULD HARDLY HAVE SUITED YOUR PLANS WOULD IT SIR
NO INDEED MARTHA SO LONG AS YOU WERE HERE I WAS EASY IN MY MIND
WE WAITED SOME TIME FOR YOUR SIGNAL TONIGHT
IT WAS THE SECRETARY SIR
I KNOW HIS CAR PASSED OURS
I THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER GO I KNEW THAT IT WOULD NOT SUIT YOUR
PLANS SIR TO FIND HIM HERE
NO INDEED WELL IT ONLY MEANT THAT WE WAITED HALF AN HOUR OR SO
UNTIL I SAW YOUR LAMP GO OUT AND KNEW THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR YOU
CAN REPORT TO ME TOMORROW IN LONDON MARTHA AT CLARIDGES HOTEL
VERY GOOD SIR
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING READY TO LEAVE
YES SIR HE POSTED SEVEN LETTERS TODAY I HAVE THE ADDRESSES AS
USUAL
VERY GOOD MARTHA I WILL LOOK INTO THEM TOMORROW GOODNIGHT
THESE PAPERS HE CONTINUED AS THE OLD LADY VANISHED ARE NOT OF
VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR OF COURSE THE INFORMATION WHICH THEY
REPRESENT HAS BEEN SENT OFF LONG AGO TO THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT THESE
ARE THE ORIGINALS WHICH COLD NOT SAFELY BE GOT OUT OF THE COUNTRY
THEN THEY ARE OF NO USE
I SHOULD NOT GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT WATSON THEY WILL AT LEAST
SHOW OUR PEOPLE WHAT IS KNOWN AND WHAT IS NOT I MAY SAY THAT A GOOD
MANY OF THESE PAPERS HAVE COME THROUGH ME AND I NEED NOT ADD ARE
THOROUGHLY UNTRUSTWORTHY IT WOULD BRIGHTEN MY DECLINING YEARS TO SEE
A GERMAN CRUISER NAVIGATING THE SOLENT ACCORDING TO THE MINEFIELD
PLANS WHICH I HAVE FURNISHED BUT YOU WATSONHE STOPPED HIS WORK
AND TOOK HIS OLD FRIEND BY THE SHOULDERSIVE HARDLY SEEN YOU IN
THE LIGHT YET HOW HAVE THE YEARS USED YOU YOU LOOK THE SAME BLITHE
BOY AS EVER
I FEEL TWENTY YEARS YOUNGER HOLMES I HAVE SELDOM FELT SO HAPPY AS
WHEN I GOT YOUR WIRE ASKING ME TO MEET YOU AT HARWICH WITH THE CAR
BUT YOU HOLMESYOU HAVE CHANGED VERY LITTLESAVE FOR THAT HORRIBLE
GOATEE
THESE ARE THE SACRIFICES ONE MAKES FOR ONES COUNTRY WATSON SAID
HOLMES PULLING AT HIS LITTLE TUFT TOMORROW IT WILL BE BUT A
DREADFUL MEMORY WITH MY HAIR CUT AND A FEW OTHER SUPERFICIAL CHANGES
I SHALL NO DOUBT REAPPEAR AT CLARIDGES TOMORROW AS I WAS BEFORE
THIS AMERICAN STUNTI BEG YOUR PARDON WATSON MY WELL OF ENGLISH
SEEMS TO BE PERMANENTLY DEFILEDBEFORE THIS AMERICAN JOB CAME MY
WAY
BUT YOU HAVE RETIRED HOLMES WE HEARD OF YOU AS LIVING THE LIFE OF
A HERMIT AMONG YOUR BEES AND YOUR BOOKS IN A SMALL FARM UPON THE
SOUTH DOWNS
EXACTLY WATSON HERE IS THE FRUIT OF MY LEISURED EASE THE MAGNUM
OPUS OF MY LATTER YEARS HE PICKED UP THE VOLUME FROM THE TABLE AND
READ OUT THE WHOLE TITLE PRACTICAL HANDBOOK OF BEE CULTURE WITH
SOME OBSERVATIONS UPON THE SEGREGATION OF THE QUEEN ALONE I DID IT
BEHOLD THE FRUIT OF PENSIVE NIGHTS AND LABORIOUS DAYS WHEN I WATCHED
THE LITTLE WORKING GANGS AS ONCE I WATCHED THE CRIMINAL WORLD OF
LONDON
BUT HOW DID YOU GET TO WORK AGAIN
AH I HAVE OFTEN MARVELLED AT IT MYSELF THE FOREIGN MINISTER ALONE
I COULD HAVE WITHSTOOD BUT WHEN THE PREMIER ALSO DEIGNED TO VISIT MY
HUMBLE ROOF THE FACT IS WATSON THAT THIS GENTLEMAN UPON THE SOFA
WAS A BIT TOO GOOD FOR OUR PEOPLE HE WAS IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF
THINGS WERE GOING WRONG AND NO ONE COULD UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WERE
GOING WRONG AGENTS WERE SUSPECTED OR EVEN CAUGHT BUT THERE WAS
EVIDENCE OF SOME STRONG AND SECRET CENTRAL FORCE IT WAS ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY TO EXPOSE IT STRONG PRESSURE WAS BROUGHT UPON ME TO LOOK
INTO THE MATTER IT HAS COST ME TWO YEARS WATSON BUT THEY HAVE NOT
BEEN DEVOID OF EXCITEMENT WHEN I SAY THAT I STARTED MY PILGRIMAGE AT
CHICAGO GRADUATED IN AN IRISH SECRET SOCIETY AT BUFFALO GAVE
SERIOUS TROUBLE TO THE CONSTABULARY AT SKIBBAREEN AND SO EVENTUALLY
CAUGHT THE EYE OF A SUBORDINATE AGENT OF VON BORK WHO RECOMMENDED ME
AS A LIKELY MAN YOU WILL REALIZE THAT THE MATTER WAS COMPLEX SINCE
THEN I HAVE BEEN HONOURED BY HIS CONFIDENCE WHICH HAS NOT PREVENTED
MOST OF HIS PLANS GOING SUBTLY WRONG AND FIVE OF HIS BEST AGENTS
BEING IN PRISON I WATCHED THEM WATSON AND I PICKED THEM AS THEY
RIPENED WELL SIR I HOPE THAT YOU ARE NONE THE WORSE
THE LAST REMARK WAS ADDRESSED TO VON BORK HIMSELF WHO AFTER MUCH
GASPING AND BLINKING HAD LAIN QUIETLY LISTENING TO HOLMESS
STATEMENT HE BROKE OUT NOW INTO A FURIOUS STREAM OF GERMAN
INVECTIVE HIS FACE CONVULSED WITH PASSION HOLMES CONTINUED HIS
SWIFT INVESTIGATION OF DOCUMENTS WHILE HIS PRISONER CURSED AND SWORE
THOUGH UNMUSICAL GERMAN IS THE MOST EXPRESSIVE OF ALL LANGUAGES
HE OBSERVED WHEN VON BORK HAD STOPPED FROM PURE EXHAUSTION HULLO
HULLO HE ADDED AS HE LOOKED HARD AT THE CORNER OF A TRACING BEFORE
PUTTING IT IN THE BOX THIS SHOULD PUT ANOTHER BIRD IN THE CAGE I
HAD NO IDEA THAT THE PAYMASTER WAS SUCH A RASCAL THOUGH I HAVE LONG
HAD AN EYE UPON HIM MISTER VON BORK YOU HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO ANSWER
FOR
THE PRISONER HAD RAISED HIMSELF WITH SOME DIFFICULTY UPON THE SOFA
AND WAS STARING WITH A STRANGE MIXTURE OF AMAZEMENT AND HATRED AT HIS
CAPTOR
I SHALL GET LEVEL WITH YOU ALTAMONT HE SAID SPEAKING WITH SLOW
DELIBERATION IF IT TAKES ME ALL MY LIFE I SHALL GET LEVEL WITH
YOU
THE OLD SWEET SONG SAID HOLMES HOW OFTEN HAVE I HEARD IT IN DAYS
GONE BY IT WAS A FAVORITE DITTY OF THE LATE LAMENTED PROFESSOR
MORIARTY COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN HAS ALSO BEEN KNOWN TO WARBLE IT
AND YET I LIVE AND KEEP BEES UPON THE SOUTH DOWNS
CURSE YOU YOU DOUBLE TRAITOR CRIED THE GERMAN STRAINING AGAINST
HIS BONDS AND GLARING MURDER FROM HIS FURIOUS EYES
NO NO IT IS NOT SO BAD AS THAT SAID HOLMES SMILING AS MY
SPEECH SURELY SHOWS YOU MR ALTAMONT OF CHICAGO HAD NO EXISTENCE IN
FACT I USED HIM AND HE IS GONE
THEN WHO ARE YOU
IT IS REALLY IMMATERIAL WHO I AM BUT SINCE THE MATTER SEEMS TO
INTEREST YOU MR VON BORK I MAY SAY THAT THIS IS NOT MY FIRST
ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY I HAVE DONE A GOOD DEAL
OF BUSINESS IN GERMANY IN THE PAST AND MY NAME IS PROBABLY FAMILIAR
TO YOU
I WOULD WISH TO KNOW IT SAID THE PRUSSIAN GRIMLY
IT WAS I WHO BROUGHT ABOUT THE SEPARATION BETWEEN IRENE ADLER AND
THE LATE KING OF BOHEMIA WHEN YOUR COUSIN HEINRICH WAS THE IMPERIAL
ENVOY IT WAS I ALSO WHO SAVED FROM MURDER BY THE NIHILIST KLOPMAN
COUNT VON UND ZU GRAFENSTEIN WHO WAS YOUR MOTHERS ELDER BROTHER IT
WAS I
VON BORK SAT UP IN AMAZEMENT
THERE IS ONLY ONE MAN HE CRIED
EXACTLY SAID HOLMES
VON BORK GROANED AND SANK BACK ON THE SOFA AND MOST OF THAT
INFORMATION CAME THROUGH YOU HE CRIED WHAT IS IT WORTH WHAT HAVE
I DONE IT IS MY RUIN FOREVER
IT IS CERTAINLY A LITTLE UNTRUSTWORTHY SAID HOLMES IT WILL
REQUIRE SOME CHECKING AND YOU HAVE LITTLE TIME TO CHECK IT YOUR
ADMIRAL MAY FIND THE NEW GUNS RATHER LARGER THAN HE EXPECTS AND THE
CRUISERS PERHAPS A TRIFLE FASTER
VON BORK CLUTCHED AT HIS OWN THROAT IN DESPAIR
THERE ARE A GOOD MANY OTHER POINTS OF DETAIL WHICH WILL NO DOUBT
COME TO LIGHT IN GOOD TIME BUT YOU HAVE ONE QUALITY WHICH IS VERY
RARE IN A GERMAN MR VON BORK YOU ARE A SPORTSMAN AND YOU WILL BEAR
ME NO ILLWILL WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT YOU WHO HAVE OUTWITTED SO MANY
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE AT LAST BEEN OUTWITTED YOURSELF AFTER ALL YOU
HAVE DONE YOUR BEST FOR YOUR COUNTRY AND I HAVE DONE MY BEST FOR
MINE AND WHAT COULD BE MORE NATURAL BESIDES HE ADDED NOT
UNKINDLY AS HE LAID HIS HAND UPON THE SHOULDER OF THE PROSTRATE MAN
IT IS BETTER THAN TO FALL BEFORE SOME IGNOBLE FOE THESE PAPERS ARE
NOW READY WATSON IF YOU WILL HELP ME WITH OUR PRISONER I THINK
THAT WE MAY GET STARTED FOR LONDON AT ONCE
IT WAS NO EASY TASK TO MOVE VON BORK FOR HE WAS A STRONG AND A
DESPERATE MAN FINALLY HOLDING EITHER ARM THE TWO FRIENDS WALKED
HIM VERY SLOWLY DOWN THE GARDEN WALK WHICH HE HAD TROD WITH SUCH
PROUD CONFIDENCE WHEN HE RECEIVED THE CONGRATULATIONS OF THE FAMOUS
DIPLOMATIST ONLY A FEW HOURS BEFORE AFTER A SHORT FINAL STRUGGLE HE
WAS HOISTED STILL BOUND HAND AND FOOT INTO THE SPARE SEAT OF THE
LITTLE CAR HIS PRECIOUS VALISE WAS WEDGED IN BESIDE HIM
I TRUST THAT YOU ARE AS COMFORTABLE AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMIT SAID
HOLMES WHEN THE FINAL ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE SHOULD I BE GUILTY OF
A LIBERTY IF I LIT A CIGAR AND PLACED IT BETWEEN YOUR LIPS
BUT ALL AMENITIES WERE WASTED UPON THE ANGRY GERMAN
I SUPPOSE YOU REALIZE MR SHERLOCK HOLMES SAID HE THAT IF YOUR
GOVERNMENT BEARS YOU OUT IN THIS TREATMENT IT BECOMES AN ACT OF WAR
WHAT ABOUT YOUR GOVERNMENT AND ALL THIS TREATMENT SAID HOLMES

THE CASEBOOK OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
PREFACE
I FEAR THAT MR SHERLOCK HOLMES MAY BECOME LIKE ONE OF THOSE POPULAR
TENORS WHO HAVING OUTLIVED THEIR TIME ARE STILL TEMPTED TO MAKE
REPEATED FAREWELL BOWS TO THEIR INDULGENT AUDIENCES THIS MUST CEASE
AND HE MUST GO THE WAY OF ALL FLESH MATERIAL OR IMAGINARY ONE LIKES
TO THINK THAT THERE IS SOME FANTASTIC LIMBO FOR THE CHILDREN OF
IMAGINATION SOME STRANGE IMPOSSIBLE PLACE WHERE THE BEAUX OF
FIELDING MAY STILL MAKE LOVE TO THE BELLES OF RICHARDSON WHERE
SCOTTS HEROES STILL MAY STRUT DICKENSS DELIGHTFUL COCKNEYS STILL
RAISE A LAUGH AND THACKERAYS WORLDLINGS CONTINUE TO CARRY ON THEIR
REPREHENSIBLE CAREERS PERHAPS IN SOME HUMBLE CORNER OF SUCH A
VALHALLA SHERLOCK AND HIS WATSON MAY FOR A TIME FIND A PLACE WHILE
SOME MORE ASTUTE SLEUTH WITH SOME EVEN LESS ASTUTE COMRADE MAY FILL
THE STAGE WHICH THEY HAVE VACATED
HIS CAREER HAS BEEN A LONG ONETHOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXAGGERATE
IT DECREPIT GENTLEMEN WHO APPROACH ME AND DECLARE THAT HIS
ADVENTURES FORMED THE READING OF THEIR BOYHOOD DO NOT MEET THE
RESPONSE FROM ME WHICH THEY SEEM TO EXPECT ONE IS NOT ANXIOUS TO
HAVE ONES PERSONAL DATES HANDLED SO UNKINDLY AS A MATTER OF COLD
FACT HOLMES MADE HIS DEBUT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET AND IN THE SIGN OF
FOUR TWO SMALL BOOKLETS WHICH APPEARED BETWEEN AND IT WAS
IN THAT A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA THE FIRST OF THE LONG SERIES OF
SHORT STORIES APPEARED IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE THE PUBLIC SEEMED
APPRECIATIVE AND DESIROUS OF MORE SO THAT FROM THAT DATE
THIRTYNINE YEARS AGO THEY HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IN A BROKEN SERIES
WHICH NOW CONTAINS NO FEWER THAN FIFTYSIX STORIES REPUBLISHED IN
THE ADVENTURES THE MEMOIRS THE RETURN AND HIS LAST BOW AND THERE
REMAIN THESE TWELVE PUBLISHED DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS WHICH ARE
HERE PRODUCED UNDER THE TITLE OF THE CASE BOOK OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HE
BEGAN HIS ADVENTURES IN THE VERY HEART OF THE LATER VICTORIAN ERA
CARRIED IT THROUGH THE ALLTOOSHORT REIGN OF EDWARD AND HAS MANAGED
TO HOLD HIS OWN LITTLE NICHE EVEN IN THESE FEVERISH DAYS THUS IT
WOULD BE TRUE TO SAY THAT THOSE WHO FIRST READ OF HIM AS YOUNG MEN
HAVE LIVED TO SEE THEIR OWN GROWNUP CHILDREN FOLLOWING THE SAME
ADVENTURES IN THE SAME MAGAZINE IT IS A STRIKING EXAMPLE OF THE
PATIENCE AND LOYALTY OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC
I HAD FULLY DETERMINED AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEMOIRS TO BRING
HOLMES TO AN END AS I FELT THAT MY LITERARY ENERGIES SHOULD NOT BE
DIRECTED TOO MUCH INTO ONE CHANNEL THAT PALE CLEARCUT FACE AND
LOOSELIMBED FIGURE WERE TAKING UP AN UNDUE SHARE OF MY IMAGINATION
I DID THE DEED BUT FORTUNATELY NO CORONER HAD PRONOUNCED UPON THE
REMAINS AND SO AFTER A LONG INTERVAL IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR ME
TO RESPOND TO THE FLATTERING DEMAND AND TO EXPLAIN MY RASH ACT AWAY
I HAVE NEVER REGRETTED IT FOR I HAVE NOT IN ACTUAL PRACTICE FOUND
THAT THESE LIGHTER SKETCHES HAVE PREVENTED ME FROM EXPLORING AND
FINDING MY LIMITATIONS IN SUCH VARIED BRANCHES OF LITERATURE AS
HISTORY POETRY HISTORICAL NOVELS PSYCHIC RESEARCH AND THE DRAMA
HAD HOLMES NEVER EXISTED I COULD NOT HAVE DONE MORE THOUGH HE MAY
PERHAPS HAVE STOOD A LITTLE IN THE WAY OF THE RECOGNITION OF MY MORE
SERIOUS LITERARY WORK
AND SO READER FAREWELL TO SHERLOCK HOLMES I THANK YOU FOR YOUR
PAST CONSTANCY AND CAN BUT HOPE THAT SOME RETURN HAS BEEN MADE IN
THE SHAPE OF THAT DISTRACTION FROM THE WORRIES OF LIFE AND
STIMULATING CHANGE OF THOUGHT WHICH CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN THE FAIRY
KINGDOM OF ROMANCE
ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE
THE ILLUSTRIOUS CLIENT
IT CANT HURT NOW WAS MR SHERLOCK HOLMESS COMMENT WHEN FOR THE
TENTH TIME IN AS MANY YEARS I ASKED HIS LEAVE TO REVEAL THE
FOLLOWING NARRATIVE SO IT WAS THAT AT LAST I OBTAINED PERMISSION TO
PUT ON RECORD WHAT WAS IN SOME WAYS THE SUPREME MOMENT OF MY
FRIENDS CAREER
BOTH HOLMES AND I HAD A WEAKNESS FOR THE TURKISH BATH IT WAS OVER A
SMOKE IN THE PLEASANT LASSITUDE OF THE DRYINGROOM THAT I HAVE FOUND
HIM LESS RETICENT AND MORE HUMAN THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE UPPER
FLOOR OF THE NORTHUMBERLAND AVENUE ESTABLISHMENT THERE IS AN ISOLATED
CORNER WHERE TWO COUCHES LIE SIDE BY SIDE AND IT WAS ON THESE THAT
WE LAY UPON SEPTEMBER THE DAY WHEN MY NARRATIVE BEGINS I
HAD ASKED HIM WHETHER ANYTHING WAS STIRRING AND FOR ANSWER HE HAD
SHOT HIS LONG THIN NERVOUS ARM OUT OF THE SHEETS WHICH ENVELOPED
HIM AND HAD DRAWN AN ENVELOPE FROM THE INSIDE POCKET OF THE COAT
WHICH HUNG BESIDE HIM
IT MAY BE SOME FUSSY SELFIMPORTANT FOOL IT MAY BE A MATTER OF
LIFE OR DEATH SAID HE AS HE HANDED ME THE NOTE I KNOW NO MORE
THAN THIS MESSAGE TELLS ME
IT WAS FROM THE CARLTON CLUB AND DATED THE EVENING BEFORE THIS IS
WHAT I READ
SIR JAMES DAMERY PRESENTS HIS COMPLIMENTS TO MR SHERLOCK HOLMES AND
WILL CALL UPON HIM AT TOMORROW SIR JAMES BEGS TO SAY THAT THE
MATTER UPON WHICH HE DESIRES TO CONSULT MR HOLMES IS VERY DELICATE
AND ALSO VERY IMPORTANT HE TRUSTS THEREFORE THAT MR HOLMES WILL
MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO GRANT THIS INTERVIEW AND THAT HE WILL CONFIRM
IT OVER THE TELEPHONE TO THE CARLTON CLUB
I NEED NOT SAY THAT I HAVE CONFIRMED IT WATSON SAID HOLMES AS I
RETURNED THE PAPER DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF THIS MAN DAMERY
ONLY THAT THIS NAME IS A HOUSEHOLD WORD IN SOCIETY
WELL I CAN TELL YOU A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT HE HAS RATHER A
REPUTATION FOR ARRANGING DELICATE MATTERS WHICH ARE TO BE KEPT OUT OF
THE PAPERS YOU MAY REMEMBER HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH SIR GEORGE LEWIS
OVER THE HAMMERFORD WILL CASE HE IS A MAN OF THE WORLD WITH A
NATURAL TURN FOR DIPLOMACY I AM BOUND THEREFORE TO HOPE THAT IT IS
NOT A FALSE SCENT AND THAT HE HAS SOME REAL NEED FOR OUR ASSISTANCE
OUR
WELL IF YOU WILL BE SO GOOD WATSON
I SHALL BE HONOURED
THEN YOU HAVE THE HOUR UNTIL THEN WE CAN PUT THE MATTER OUT
OF OUR HEADS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN ROOMS IN QUEEN ANNE STREET AT THE TIME BUT I
WAS ROUND AT BAKER STREET BEFORE THE TIME NAMED SHARP TO THE
HALFHOUR COLONEL SIR JAMES DAMERY WAS ANNOUNCED IT IS HARDLY
NECESSARY TO DESCRIBE HIM FOR MANY WILL REMEMBER THAT LARGE BLUFF
HONEST PERSONALITY THAT BROAD CLEANSHAVEN FACE AND ABOVE ALL
THAT PLEASANT MELLOW VOICE FRANKNESS SHONE FROM HIS GRAY IRISH
EYES AND GOOD HUMOUR PLAYED ROUND HIS MOBILE SMILING LIPS HIS
LUCENT TOPHAT HIS DARK FROCKCOAT INDEED EVERY DETAIL FROM THE
PEARL PIN IN THE BLACK SATIN CRAVAT TO THE LAVENDER SPATS OVER THE
VARNISHED SHOES SPOKE OF THE METICULOUS CARE IN DRESS FOR WHICH HE
WAS FAMOUS THE BIG MASTERFUL ARISTOCRAT DOMINATED THE LITTLE ROOM
OF COURSE I WAS PREPARED TO FIND DR WATSON HE REMARKED WITH A
COURTEOUS BOW HIS COLLABORATION MAY BE VERY NECESSARY FOR WE ARE
DEALING ON THIS OCCASION MR HOLMES WITH A MAN TO WHOM VIOLENCE IS
FAMILIAR AND WHO WILL LITERALLY STICK AT NOTHING I SHOULD SAY THAT
THERE IS NO MORE DANGEROUS MAN IN EUROPE
I HAVE HAD SEVERAL OPPONENTS TO WHOM THAT FLATTERING TERM HAS BEEN
APPLIED SAID HOLMES WITH A SMILE DONT YOU SMOKE THEN YOU WILL
EXCUSE ME IF I LIGHT MY PIPE IF YOUR MAN IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE
LATE PROFESSOR MORIARTY OR THAN THE LIVING COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN
THEN HE IS INDEED WORTH MEETING MAY I ASK HIS NAME
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF BARON GRUNER
YOU MEAN THE AUSTRIAN MURDERER
COLONEL DAMERY THREW UP HIS KIDGLOVED HANDS WITH A LAUGH THERE IS
NO GETTING PAST YOU MR HOLMES WONDERFUL SO YOU HAVE ALREADY SIZED
HIM UP AS A MURDERER
IT IS MY BUSINESS TO FOLLOW THE DETAILS OF CONTINENTAL CRIME WHO
COULD POSSIBLY HAVE READ WHAT HAPPENED AT PRAGUE AND HAVE ANY DOUBTS
AS TO THE MANS GUILT IT WAS A PURELY TECHNICAL LEGAL POINT AND THE
SUSPICIOUS DEATH OF A WITNESS THAT SAVED HIM I AM AS SURE THAT HE
KILLED HIS WIFE WHEN THE SOCALLED ACCIDENT HAPPENED IN THE SPLUGEN
PASS AS IF I HAD SEEN HIM DO IT I KNEW ALSO THAT HE HAD COME TO
ENGLAND AND HAD A PRESENTIMENT THAT SOONER OR LATER HE WOULD FIND ME
SOME WORK TO DO WELL WHAT HAS BARON GRUNER BEEN UP TO I PRESUME IT
IS NOT THIS OLD TRAGEDY WHICH HAS COME UP AGAIN
NO IT IS MORE SERIOUS THAN THAT TO REVENGE CRIME IS IMPORTANT BUT
TO PREVENT IT IS MORE SO IT IS A TERRIBLE THING MR HOLMES TO SEE
A DREADFUL EVENT AN ATROCIOUS SITUATION PREPARING ITSELF BEFORE
YOUR EYES TO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHITHER IT WILL LEAD AND YET TO BE
UTTERLY UNABLE TO AVERT IT CAN A HUMAN BEING BE PLACED IN A MORE
TRYING POSITION
PERHAPS NOT
THEN YOU WILL SYMPATHIZE WITH THE CLIENT IN WHOSE INTERESTS I AM
ACTING
I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WERE MERELY AN INTERMEDIARY WHO IS
THE PRINCIPAL
MR HOLMES I MUST BEG YOU NOT TO PRESS THAT QUESTION IT IS
IMPORTANT THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASSURE HIM THAT HIS HONOURED NAME
HAS BEEN IN NO WAY DRAGGED INTO THE MATTER HIS MOTIVES ARE TO THE
LAST DEGREE HONOURABLE AND CHIVALROUS BUT HE PREFERS TO REMAIN
UNKNOWN I NEED NOT SAY THAT YOUR FEES WILL BE ASSURED AND THAT YOU
WILL BE GIVEN A PERFECTLY FREE HAND SURELY THE ACTUAL NAME OF YOUR
CLIENT IS IMMATERIAL
I AM SORRY SAID HOLMES I AM ACCUSTOMED TO HAVE MYSTERY AT ONE
END OF MY CASES BUT TO HAVE IT AT BOTH ENDS IS TOO CONFUSING I
FEAR SIR JAMES THAT I MUST DECLINE TO ACT
OUR VISITOR WAS GREATLY DISTURBED HIS LARGE SENSITIVE FACE WAS
DARKENED WITH EMOTION AND DISAPPOINTMENT
YOU HARDLY REALIZE THE EFFECT OF YOUR OWN ACTION MR HOLMES SAID
HE YOU PLACE ME IN A MOST SERIOUS DILEMMA FOR I AM PERFECTLY
CERTAIN THAT YOU WOULD BE PROUD TO TAKE OVER THE CASE IF I COULD GIVE
YOU THE FACTS AND YET A PROMISE FORBIDS ME FROM REVEALING THEM ALL
MAY I AT LEAST LAY ALL THAT I CAN BEFORE YOU
BY ALL MEANS SO LONG AS IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT I COMMIT MYSELF TO
NOTHING
THAT IS UNDERSTOOD IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU HAVE NO DOUBT HEARD OF
GENERAL DE MERVILLE
DE MERVILLE OF KHYBER FAME YES I HAVE HEARD OF HIM
HE HAS A DAUGHTER VIOLET DE MERVILLE YOUNG RICH BEAUTIFUL
ACCOMPLISHED A WONDERWOMAN IN EVERY WAY IT IS THIS DAUGHTER THIS
LOVELY INNOCENT GIRL WHOM WE ARE ENDEAVOURING TO SAVE FROM THE
CLUTCHES OF A FIEND
BARON GRUNER HAS SOME HOLD OVER HER THEN
THE STRONGEST OF ALL HOLDS WHERE A WOMAN IS CONCERNEDTHE HOLD OF
LOVE THE FELLOW IS AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD EXTRAORDINARILY HANDSOME
WITH A MOST FASCINATING MANNER A GENTLE VOICE AND THAT AIR OF
ROMANCE AND MYSTERY WHICH MEANS SO MUCH TO A WOMAN HE IS SAID TO
HAVE THE WHOLE SEX AT HIS MERCY AND TO HAVE MADE AMPLE USE OF THE
FACT
BUT HOW CAME SUCH A MAN TO MEET A LADY OF THE STANDING OF MISS
VIOLET DE MERVILLE
IT WAS ON A MEDITERRANEAN YACHTING VOYAGE THE COMPANY THOUGH
SELECT PAID THEIR OWN PASSAGES NO DOUBT THE PROMOTERS HARDLY
REALIZED THE BARONS TRUE CHARACTER UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE THE
VILLAIN ATTACHED HIMSELF TO THE LADY AND WITH SUCH EFFECT THAT HE
HAS COMPLETELY AND ABSOLUTELY WON HER HEART TO SAY THAT SHE LOVES
HIM HARDLY EXPRESSES IT SHE DOTES UPON HIM SHE IS OBSESSED BY HIM
OUTSIDE OF HIM THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH SHE WILL NOT HEAR ONE WORD
AGAINST HIM EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO CURE HER OF HER MADNESS BUT
IN VAIN TO SUM UP SHE PROPOSES TO MARRY HIM NEXT MONTH AS SHE IS
OF AGE AND HAS A WILL OF IRON IT IS HARD TO KNOW HOW TO PREVENT
HER
DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT THE AUSTRIAN EPISODE
THE CUNNING DEVIL HAS TOLD HER EVERY UNSAVOURY PUBLIC SCANDAL OF HIS
PAST LIFE BUT ALWAYS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE HIMSELF OUT TO BE AN
INNOCENT MARTYR SHE ABSOLUTELY ACCEPTS HIS VERSION AND WILL LISTEN
TO NO OTHER
DEAR ME BUT SURELY YOU HAVE INADVERTENTLY LET OUT THE NAME OF YOUR
CLIENT IT IS NO DOUBT GENERAL DE MERVILLE
OUR VISITOR FIDGETED IN HIS CHAIR
I COULD DECEIVE YOU BY SAYING SO MR HOLMES BUT IT WOULD NOT BE
TRUE DE MERVILLE IS A BROKEN MAN THE STRONG SOLDIER HAS BEEN
UTTERLY DEMORALIZED BY THIS INCIDENT HE HAS LOST THE NERVE WHICH
NEVER FAILED HIM ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND HAS BECOME A WEAK DODDERING
OLD MAN UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF CONTENDING WITH A BRILLIANT FORCEFUL
RASCAL LIKE THIS AUSTRIAN MY CLIENT HOWEVER IS AN OLD FRIEND ONE
WHO HAS KNOWN THE GENERAL INTIMATELY FOR MANY YEARS AND TAKEN A
PATERNAL INTEREST IN THIS YOUNG GIRL SINCE SHE WORE SHORT FROCKS HE
CANNOT SEE THIS TRAGEDY CONSUMMATED WITHOUT SOME ATTEMPT TO STOP IT
THERE IS NOTHING IN WHICH SCOTLAND YARD CAN ACT IT WAS HIS OWN
SUGGESTION THAT YOU SHOULD BE CALLED IN BUT IT WAS AS I HAVE SAID
ON THE EXPRESS STIPULATION THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE PERSONALLY INVOLVED
IN THE MATTER I HAVE NO DOUBT MR HOLMES WITH YOUR GREAT POWERS
YOU COULD EASILY TRACE MY CLIENT BACK THROUGH ME BUT I MUST ASK YOU
AS A POINT OF HONOUR TO REFRAIN FROM DOING SO AND NOT TO BREAK IN
UPON HIS INCOGNITO
HOLMES GAVE A WHIMSICAL SMILE
I THINK I MAY SAFELY PROMISE THAT SAID HE I MAY ADD THAT YOUR
PROBLEM INTERESTS ME AND THAT I SHALL BE PREPARED TO LOOK INTO IT
HOW SHALL I KEEP IN TOUCH WITH YOU
THE CARLTON CLUB WILL FIND ME BUT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY THERE IS A
PRIVATE TELEPHONE CALL XX
HOLMES NOTED IT DOWN AND SAT STILL SMILING WITH THE OPEN
MEMORANDUMBOOK UPON HIS KNEE
THE BARONS PRESENT ADDRESS PLEASE
VERNON LODGE NEAR KINGSTON IT IS A LARGE HOUSE HE HAS BEEN
FORTUNATE IN SOME RATHER SHADY SPECULATIONS AND IS A RICH MAN WHICH
NATURALLY MAKES HIM A MORE DANGEROUS ANTAGONIST
IS HE AT HOME AT PRESENT
YES
APART FROM WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME CAN YOU GIVE ME ANY FURTHER
INFORMATION ABOUT THE MAN
HE HAS EXPENSIVE TASTES HE IS A HORSE FANCIER FOR A SHORT TIME HE
PLAYED POLO AT HURLINGHAM BUT THEN THIS PRAGUE AFFAIR GOT NOISED
ABOUT AND HE HAD TO LEAVE HE COLLECTS BOOKS AND PICTURES HE IS A
MAN WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARTISTIC SIDE TO HIS NATURE HE IS I
BELIEVE A RECOGNIZED AUTHORITY UPON CHINESE POTTERY AND HAS WRITTEN
A BOOK UPON THE SUBJECT
A COMPLEX MIND SAID HOLMES ALL GREAT CRIMINALS HAVE THAT MY OLD
FRIEND CHARLIE PEACE WAS A VIOLIN VIRTUOSO WAINWRIGHT WAS NO MEAN
ARTIST I COULD QUOTE MANY MORE WELL SIR JAMES YOU WILL INFORM
YOUR CLIENT THAT I AM TURNING MY MIND UPON BARON GRUNER I CAN SAY NO
MORE I HAVE SOME SOURCES OF INFORMATION OF MY OWN AND I DARE SAY WE
MAY FIND SOME MEANS OF OPENING THE MATTER UP
WHEN OUR VISITOR HAD LEFT US HOLMES SAT SO LONG IN DEEP THOUGHT THAT
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN MY PRESENCE AT LAST HOWEVER
HE CAME BRISKLY BACK TO EARTH
WELL WATSON ANY VIEWS HE ASKED
I SHOULD THINK YOU HAD BETTER SEE THE YOUNG LADY HERSELF
MY DEAR WATSON IF HER POOR OLD BROKEN FATHER CANNOT MOVE HER HOW
SHALL I A STRANGER PREVAIL AND YET THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE
SUGGESTION IF ALL ELSE FAILS BUT I THINK WE MUST BEGIN FROM A
DIFFERENT ANGLE I RATHER FANCY THAT SHINWELL JOHNSON MIGHT BE A
HELP
I HAVE NOT HAD OCCASION TO MENTION SHINWELL JOHNSON IN THESE MEMOIRS
BECAUSE I HAVE SELDOM DRAWN MY CASES FROM THE LATTER PHASES OF MY
FRIENDS CAREER DURING THE FIRST YEARS OF THE CENTURY HE BECAME A
VALUABLE ASSISTANT JOHNSON I GRIEVE TO SAY MADE HIS NAME FIRST AS
A VERY DANGEROUS VILLAIN AND SERVED TWO TERMS AT PARKHURST FINALLY
HE REPENTED AND ALLIED HIMSELF TO HOLMES ACTING AS HIS AGENT IN THE
HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON AND OBTAINING INFORMATION WHICH
OFTEN PROVED TO BE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE HAD JOHNSON BEEN A NARK OF
THE POLICE HE WOULD SOON HAVE BEEN EXPOSED BUT AS HE DEALT WITH
CASES WHICH NEVER CAME DIRECTLY INTO THE COURTS HIS ACTIVITIES WERE
NEVER REALIZED BY HIS COMPANIONS WITH THE GLAMOUR OF HIS TWO
CONVICTIONS UPON HIM HE HAD THE ENTREE OF EVERY NIGHTCLUB DOSS
HOUSE AND GAMBLINGDEN IN THE TOWN AND HIS QUICK OBSERVATION AND
ACTIVE BRAIN MADE HIM AN IDEAL AGENT FOR GAINING INFORMATION IT WAS
TO HIM THAT SHERLOCK HOLMES NOW PROPOSED TO TURN
IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO FOLLOW THE IMMEDIATE STEPS TAKEN BY MY
FRIEND FOR I HAD SOME PRESSING PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS OF MY OWN BUT
I MET HIM BY APPOINTMENT THAT EVENING AT SIMPSONS WHERE SITTING AT
A SMALL TABLE IN THE FRONT WINDOW AND LOOKING DOWN AT THE RUSHING
STREAM OF LIFE IN THE STRAND HE TOLD ME SOMETHING OF WHAT HAD
PASSED
JOHNSON IS ON THE PROWL SAID HE HE MAY PICK UP SOME GARBAGE IN
THE DARKER RECESSES OF THE UNDERWORLD FOR IT IS DOWN THERE AMID THE
BLACK ROOTS OF CRIME THAT WE MUST HUNT FOR THIS MANS SECRETS
BUT IF THE LADY WILL NOT ACCEPT WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN WHY SHOULD
ANY FRESH DISCOVERY OF YOURS TURN HER FROM HER PURPOSE
WHO KNOWS WATSON WOMANS HEART AND MIND ARE INSOLUBLE PUZZLES TO
THE MALE MURDER MIGHT BE CONDONED OR EXPLAINED AND YET SOME SMALLER
OFFENCE MIGHT RANKLE BARON GRUNER REMARKED TO ME
HE REMARKED TO YOU
OH TO BE SURE I HAD NOT TOLD YOU OF MY PLANS WELL WATSON I LOVE
TO COME TO CLOSE GRIPS WITH MY MAN I LIKE TO MEET HIM EYE TO EYE AND
READ FOR MYSELF THE STUFF THAT HE IS MADE OF WHEN I HAD GIVEN
JOHNSON HIS INSTRUCTIONS I TOOK A CAB OUT TO KINGSTON AND FOUND THE
BARON IN A MOST AFFABLE MOOD
DID HE RECOGNIZE YOU
THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT THAT FOR I SIMPLY SENT IN MY CARD HE
IS AN EXCELLENT ANTAGONIST COOL AS ICE SILKY VOICED AND SOOTHING AS
ONE OF YOUR FASHIONABLE CONSULTANTS AND POISONOUS AS A COBRA HE HAS
BREEDING IN HIMA REAL ARISTOCRAT OF CRIME WITH A SUPERFICIAL
SUGGESTION OF AFTERNOON TEA AND ALL THE CRUELTY OF THE GRAVE BEHIND
IT YES I AM GLAD TO HAVE HAD MY ATTENTION CALLED TO BARON ADELBERT
GRUNER
YOU SAY HE WAS AFFABLE
A PURRING CAT WHO THINKS HE SEES PROSPECTIVE MICE SOME PEOPLES
AFFABILITY IS MORE DEADLY THAN THE VIOLENCE OF COARSER SOULS HIS
GREETING WAS CHARACTERISTIC I RATHER THOUGHT I SHOULD SEE YOU
SOONER OR LATER MR HOLMES SAID HE YOU HAVE BEEN ENGAGED NO
DOUBT BY GENERAL DE MERVILLE TO ENDEAVOUR TO STOP MY MARRIAGE WITH
HIS DAUGHTER VIOLET THAT IS SO IS IT NOT
I ACQUIESCED
MY DEAR MAN SAID HE YOU WILL ONLY RUIN YOUR OWN WELLDESERVED
REPUTATION IT IS NOT A CASE IN WHICH YOU CAN POSSIBLY SUCCEED YOU
WILL HAVE BARREN WORK TO SAY NOTHING OF INCURRING SOME DANGER LET
ME VERY STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO DRAW OFF AT ONCE
IT IS CURIOUS I ANSWERED BUT THAT WAS THE VERY ADVICE WHICH I
HAD INTENDED TO GIVE YOU I HAVE A RESPECT FOR YOUR BRAINS BARON
AND THE LITTLE WHICH I HAVE SEEN OF YOUR PERSONALITY HAS NOT LESSENED
IT LET ME PUT IT TO YOU AS MAN TO MAN NO ONE WANTS TO RAKE UP YOUR
PAST AND MAKE YOU UNDULY UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS OVER AND YOU ARE NOW
IN SMOOTH WATERS BUT IF YOU PERSIST IN THIS MARRIAGE YOU WILL RAISE
UP A SWARM OF POWERFUL ENEMIES WHO WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU ALONE UNTIL
THEY HAVE MADE ENGLAND TOO HOT TO HOLD YOU IS THE GAME WORTH IT
SURELY YOU WOULD BE WISER IF YOU LEFT THE LADY ALONE IT WOULD NOT BE
PLEASANT FOR YOU IF THESE FACTS OF YOUR PAST WERE BROUGHT TO HER
NOTICE
THE BARON HAS LITTLE WAXED TIPS OF HAIR UNDER HIS NOSE LIKE THE
SHORT ANTENNAE OF AN INSECT THESE QUIVERED WITH AMUSEMENT AS HE
LISTENED AND HE FINALLY BROKE INTO A GENTLE CHUCKLE
EXCUSE MY AMUSEMENT MR HOLMES SAID HE BUT IT IS REALLY FUNNY
TO SEE YOU TRYING TO PLAY A HAND WITH NO CARDS IN IT I DONT THINK
ANYONE COULD DO IT BETTER BUT IT IS RATHER PATHETIC ALL THE SAME
NOT A COLOUR CARD THERE MR HOLMES NOTHING BUT THE SMALLEST OF THE
SMALL
SO YOU THINK
SO I KNOW LET ME MAKE THE THING CLEAR TO YOU FOR MY OWN HAND IS
SO STRONG THAT I CAN AFFORD TO SHOW IT I HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO WIN THE ENTIRE AFFECTION OF THIS LADY THIS WAS GIVEN TO ME IN
SPITE OF THE FACT THAT I TOLD HER VERY CLEARLY OF ALL THE UNHAPPY
INCIDENTS IN MY PAST LIFE I ALSO TOLD HER THAT CERTAIN WICKED AND
DESIGNING PERSONSI HOPE YOU RECOGNIZE YOURSELFWOULD COME TO HER
AND TELL HER THESE THINGS AND I WARNED HER HOW TO TREAT THEM YOU
HAVE HEARD OF POSTHYPNOTIC SUGGESTION MR HOLMES WELL YOU WILL
SEE HOW IT WORKS FOR A MAN OF PERSONALITY CAN USE HYPNOTISM WITHOUT
ANY VULGAR PASSES OR TOMFOOLERY SO SHE IS READY FOR YOU AND I HAVE
NO DOUBT WOULD GIVE YOU AN APPOINTMENT FOR SHE IS QUITE AMENABLE TO
HER FATHERS WILLSAVE ONLY IN THE ONE LITTLE MATTER
WELL WATSON THERE SEEMED TO BE NO MORE TO SAY SO I TOOK MY LEAVE
WITH AS MUCH COLD DIGNITY AS I COULD SUMMON BUT AS I HAD MY HAND ON
THE DOORHANDLE HE STOPPED ME
BY THE WAY MR HOLMES SAID HE DID YOU KNOW LE BRUN THE FRENCH
AGENT
YES SAID I
DO YOU KNOW WHAT BEFELL HIM
I HEARD THAT HE WAS BEATEN BY SOME APACHES IN THE MONTMARTRE
DISTRICT AND CRIPPLED FOR LIFE
QUITE TRUE MR HOLMES BY A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE HE HAD BEEN
INQUIRING INTO MY AFFAIRS ONLY A WEEK BEFORE DONT DO IT MR
HOLMES ITS NOT A LUCKY THING TO DO SEVERAL HAVE FOUND THAT OUT MY
LAST WORD TO YOU IS GO YOUR OWN WAY AND LET ME GO MINE GOODBYE
SO THERE YOU ARE WATSON YOU ARE UP TO DATE NOW
THE FELLOW SEEMS DANGEROUS
MIGHTY DANGEROUS I DISREGARD THE BLUSTERER BUT THIS IS THE SORT OF
MAN WHO SAYS RATHER LESS THAN HE MEANS
MUST YOU INTERFERE DOES IT REALLY MATTER IF HE MARRIES THE GIRL
CONSIDERING THAT HE UNDOUBTEDLY MURDERED HIS LAST WIFE I SHOULD SAY
IT MATTERED VERY MUCH BESIDES THE CLIENT WELL WELL WE NEED NOT
DISCUSS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED YOUR COFFEE YOU HAD BEST COME
HOME WITH ME FOR THE BLITHE SHINWELL WILL BE THERE WITH HIS REPORT
WE FOUND HIM SURE ENOUGH A HUGE COARSE REDFACED SCORBUTIC MAN
WITH A PAIR OF VIVID BLACK EYES WHICH WERE THE ONLY EXTERNAL SIGN OF
THE VERY CUNNING MIND WITHIN IT SEEMS THAT HE HAD DIVED DOWN INTO
WHAT WAS PECULIARLY HIS KINGDOM AND BESIDE HIM ON THE SETTEE WAS A
BRAND WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT UP IN THE SHAPE OF A SLIM FLAMELIKE
YOUNG WOMAN WITH A PALE INTENSE FACE YOUTHFUL AND YET SO WORN WITH
SIN AND SORROW THAT ONE READ THE TERRIBLE YEARS WHICH HAD LEFT THEIR
LEPROUS MARK UPON HER

ONCE MORE AT OUR STRAND RESTAURANT HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WHEN I
ASKED HIM WHAT LUCK HE HAD HAD IN HIS INTERVIEW THEN HE TOLD THE
STORY WHICH I WOULD REPEAT IN THIS WAY HIS HARD DRY STATEMENT

THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY AT ALL ABOUT THE APPOINTMENT SAID HOLMES
FOR THE GIRL GLORIES IN SHOWING ABJECT FILIAL OBEDIENCE IN ALL
SECONDARY THINGS IN AN ATTEMPT TO ATONE FOR HER FLAGRANT BREACH OF IT

YELLOWCURTAINED DRAWINGROOM AND THERE WAS THE LADY AWAITING US

MAY MEET HER BEFORE WE ARE THROUGH AND YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN GIFT OF
WORDS SHE IS BEAUTIFUL BUT WITH THE ETHEREAL OTHERWORLD BEAUTY OF
SOME FANATIC WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE SET ON HIGH I HAVE SEEN SUCH FACES
IN THE PICTURES OF THE OLD MASTERS OF THE MIDDLE AGES HOW A BEASTMAN
COULD HAVE LAID HIS VILE PAWS UPON SUCH A BEING OF THE BEYOND I
CANNOT IMAGINE YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED HOW EXTREMES CALL TO EACH OTHER
THE SPIRITUAL TO THE ANIMAL THE CAVEMAN TO THE ANGEL YOU NEVER SAW
A WORSE CASE THAN THIS
SHE KNEW WHAT WE HAD COME FOR OF COURSETHAT VILLAIN HAD LOST NO
TIME IN POISONING HER MIND AGAINST US MISS WINTERS ADVENT RATHER
AMAZED HER I THINK BUT SHE WAVED US INTO OUR RESPECTIVE CHAIRS LIKE
A REVEREND ABBESS RECEIVING TWO RATHER LEPROUS MENDICANTS IF YOUR
HEAD IS INCLINED TO SWELL MY DEAR WATSON TAKE A COURSE OF MISS
VIOLET DE MERVILLE

THAT I SEE YOU AT ALL AND I WARN YOU IN ADVANCE THAT ANYTHING YOU
CAN SAY COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT UPON MY MIND
I WAS SORRY FOR HER WATSON I THOUGHT OF HER FOR THE MOMENT AS I
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF A DAUGHTER OF MY OWN I AM NOT OFTEN ELOQUENT
I USE MY HEAD NOT MY HEART BUT I REALLY DID PLEAD WITH HER WITH ALL
THE WARMTH OF WORDS THAT I COULD FIND IN MY NATURE I PICTURED TO HER
THE AWFUL POSITION OF THE WOMAN WHO ONLY WAKES TO A MANS CHARACTER
AFTER SHE IS HIS WIFEA WOMAN WHO HAS TO SUBMIT TO BE CARESSED BY
BLOODY HANDS AND LECHEROUS LIPS I SPARED HER NOTHINGTHE SHAME THE
FEAR THE AGONY THE HOPELESSNESS OF IT ALL ALL MY HOT WORDS COULD
NOT BRING ONE TINGE OF COLOUR TO THOSE IVORY CHEEKS OR ONE GLEAM OF
EMOTION TO THOSE ABSTRACTED EYES I THOUGHT OF WHAT THE RASCAL HAD
SAID ABOUT A POSTHYPNOTIC INFLUENCE ONE COULD REALLY BELIEVE THAT
SHE WAS LIVING ABOVE THE EARTH IN SOME ECSTATIC DREAM YET THERE WAS
NOTHING INDEFINITE IN HER REPLIES
I HAVE LISTENED TO YOU WITH PATIENCE MR HOLMES SAID SHE THE
EFFECT UPON MY MIND IS EXACTLY AS PREDICTED I AM AWARE THAT
ADELBERT THAT MY FIANC HAS HAD A STORMY LIFE IN WHICH HE HAS
INCURRED BITTER HATREDS AND MOST UNJUST ASPERSIONS YOU ARE ONLY THE
LAST OF A SERIES WHO HAVE BROUGHT THEIR SLANDERS BEFORE ME POSSIBLY
YOU MEAN WELL THOUGH I LEARN THAT YOU ARE A PAID AGENT WHO WOULD
HAVE BEEN EQUALLY WILLING TO ACT FOR THE BARON AS AGAINST HIM BUT IN
ANY CASE I WISH YOU TO UNDERSTAND ONCE FOR ALL THAT I LOVE HIM AND
THAT HE LOVES ME AND THAT THE OPINION OF ALL THE WORLD IS NO MORE TO
ME THAN THE TWITTER OF THOSE BIRDS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW IF HIS NOBLE
NATURE HAS EVER FOR AN INSTANT FALLEN IT MAY BE THAT I HAVE BEEN
SPECIALLY SENT TO RAISE IT TO ITS TRUE AND LOFTY LEVEL I AM NOT

I SHOULD PREFER NOT TO DISCUSS SUCH MATTERS SAID MISS DE MERVILLE
COLDLY LET ME SAY ONCE FOR ALL THAT I AM AWARE OF THREE PASSAGES IN
MY FIANCS LIFE IN WHICH HE BECAME ENTANGLED WITH DESIGNING WOMEN
AND THAT I AM ASSURED OF HIS HEARTY REPENTANCE FOR ANY EVIL THAT HE

FOOL
MR HOLMES I BEG THAT YOU WILL BRING THIS INTERVIEW TO AN END
SAID THE ICY VOICE I HAVE OBEYED MY FATHERS WISH IN SEEING YOU
BUT I AM NOT COMPELLED TO LISTEN TO THE RAVINGS OF THIS PERSON
WITH AN OATH MISS WINTER DARTED FORWARD AND IF I HAD NOT CAUGHT HER
WRIST SHE WOULD HAVE CLUTCHED THIS MADDENING WOMAN BY THE HAIR I
DRAGGED HER TOWARDS THE DOOR AND WAS LUCKY TO GET HER BACK INTO THE
CAB WITHOUT A PUBLIC SCENE FOR SHE WAS BESIDE HERSELF WITH RAGE IN
A COLD WAY I FELT PRETTY FURIOUS MYSELF WATSON FOR THERE WAS
SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY ANNOYING IN THE CALM ALOOFNESS AND SUPREME
SELFCOMPLAISANCE OF THE WOMAN WHOM WE WERE TRYING TO SAVE SO NOW
ONCE AGAIN YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW WE STAND AND IT IS CLEAR THAT I MUST
PLAN SOME FRESH OPENING MOVE FOR THIS GAMBIT WONT WORK ILL KEEP
IN TOUCH WITH YOU WATSON FOR IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT YOU WILL
HAVE YOUR PART TO PLAY THOUGH IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT THE NEXT MOVE
MAY LIE WITH THEM RATHER THAN WITH US
AND IT DID THEIR BLOW FELLOR HIS BLOW RATHER FOR NEVER COULD I
BELIEVE THAT THE LADY WAS PRIVY TO IT I THINK I COULD SHOW YOU THE
VERY PAVINGSTONE UPON WHICH I STOOD WHEN MY EYES FELL UPON THE
PLACARD AND A PANG OF HORROR PASSED THROUGH MY VERY SOUL IT WAS
BETWEEN THE GRAND HOTEL AND CHARING CROSS STATION WHERE A ONELEGGED
NEWSVENDER DISPLAYED HIS EVENING PAPERS THE DATE WAS JUST TWO DAYS
AFTER THE LAST CONVERSATION THERE BLACK UPON YELLOW WAS THE
TERRIBLE NEWSSHEET
MURDEROUS ATTACK UPON SHERLOCK HOLMES
I THINK I STOOD STUNNED FOR SOME MOMENTS THEN I HAVE A CONFUSED
RECOLLECTION OF SNATCHING AT A PAPER OF THE REMONSTRANCE OF THE MAN
WHOM I HAD NOT PAID AND FINALLY OF STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF A
CHEMISTS SHOP WHILE I TURNED UP THE FATEFUL PARAGRAPH THIS WAS HOW
IT RAN
WE LEARN WITH REGRET THAT MR SHERLOCK HOLMES THE WELLKNOWN PRIVATE
DETECTIVE WAS THE VICTIM THIS MORNING OF A MURDEROUS ASSAULT WHICH
HAS LEFT HIM IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION THERE ARE NO EXACT DETAILS TO
HAND BUT THE EVENT SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED ABOUT TWELVE OCLOCK IN
REGENT STREET OUTSIDE THE CAFE ROYAL THE ATTACK WAS MADE BY TWO MEN
ARMED WITH STICKS AND MR HOLMES WAS BEATEN ABOUT THE HEAD AND BODY
RECEIVING INJURIES WHICH THE DOCTORS DESCRIBE AS MOST SERIOUS HE WAS
CARRIED TO CHARING CROSS HOSPITAL AND AFTERWARDS INSISTED UPON BEING
TAKEN TO HIS ROOMS IN BAKER STREET THE MISCREANTS WHO ATTACKED HIM
APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN RESPECTABLY DRESSED MEN WHO ESCAPED FROM THE
BYSTANDERS BY PASSING THROUGH THE CAFE ROYAL AND OUT INTO GLASSHOUSE
STREET BEHIND IT NO DOUBT THEY BELONGED TO THAT CRIMINAL FRATERNITY
WHICH HAS SO OFTEN HAD OCCASION TO BEWAIL THE ACTIVITY AND INGENUITY
OF THE INJURED MAN
I NEED NOT SAY THAT MY EYES HAD HARDLY GLANCED OVER THE PARAGRAPH
BEFORE I HAD SPRUNG INTO A HANSOM AND WAS ON MY WAY TO BAKER STREET
I FOUND SIR LESLIE OAKSHOTT THE FAMOUS SURGEON IN THE HALL AND HIS
BROUGHAM WAITING AT THE CURB
NO IMMEDIATE DANGER WAS HIS REPORT TWO LACERATED SCALP WOUNDS
AND SOME CONSIDERABLE BRUISES SEVERAL STITCHES HAVE BEEN NECESSARY
MORPHINE HAS BEEN INJECTED AND QUIET IS ESSENTIAL BUT AN INTERVIEW
OF A FEW MINUTES WOULD NOT BE ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
WITH THIS PERMISSION I STOLE INTO THE DARKENED ROOM THE SUFFERER WAS
WIDE AWAKE AND I HEARD MY NAME IN A HOARSE WHISPER THE BLIND WAS
THREEQUARTERS DOWN BUT ONE RAY OF SUNLIGHT SLANTED THROUGH AND
STRUCK THE BANDAGED HEAD OF THE INJURED MAN A CRIMSON PATCH HAD
SOAKED THROUGH THE WHITE LINEN COMPRESS I SAT BESIDE HIM AND BENT MY
HEAD
ALL RIGHT WATSON DONT LOOK SO SCARED HE MUTTERED IN A VERY WEAK
VOICE ITS NOT AS BAD AS IT SEEMS
THANK GOD FOR THAT
IM A BIT OF A SINGLESTICK EXPERT AS YOU KNOW I TOOK MOST OF THEM
ON MY GUARD IT WAS THE SECOND MAN THAT WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME
WHAT CAN I DO HOLMES OF COURSE IT WAS THAT DAMNED FELLOW WHO SET
THEM ON ILL GO AND THRASH THE HIDE OFF HIM IF YOU GIVE THE WORD
GOOD OLD WATSON NO WE CAN DO NOTHING THERE UNLESS THE POLICE LAY
THEIR HANDS ON THE MEN BUT THEIR GETAWAY HAD BEEN WELL PREPARED WE
MAY BE SURE OF THAT WAIT A LITTLE I HAVE MY PLANS THE FIRST THING
IS TO EXAGGERATE MY INJURIES THEYLL COME TO YOU FOR NEWS PUT IT ON
THICK WATSON LUCKY IF I LIVE THE WEEK
OUTCONCUSSIONDELIRIUMWHAT YOU LIKE YOU CANT OVERDO IT
BUT SIR LESLIE OAKSHOTT
OH HES ALL RIGHT HE SHALL SEE THE WORST SIDE OF ME ILL LOOK
AFTER THAT
ANYTHING ELSE
YES TELL SHINWELL JOHNSON TO GET THAT GIRL OUT OF THE WAY THOSE
BEAUTIES WILL BE AFTER HER NOW THEY KNOW OF COURSE THAT SHE WAS
WITH ME IN THE CASE IF THEY DARED TO DO ME IN IT IS NOT LIKELY THEY
WILL NEGLECT HER THAT IS URGENT DO IT TONIGHT
ILL GO NOW ANYTHING MORE
PUT MY PIPE ON THE TABLEAND THE TOBACCOSLIPPER RIGHT COME IN
EACH MORNING AND WE WILL PLAN OUR CAMPAIGN
I ARRANGED WITH JOHNSON THAT EVENING TO TAKE MISS WINTER TO A QUIET
SUBURB AND SEE THAT SHE LAY LOW UNTIL THE DANGER WAS PAST
FOR SIX DAYS THE PUBLIC WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HOLMES WAS AT
THE DOOR OF DEATH THE BULLETINS WERE VERY GRAVE AND THERE WERE
SINISTER PARAGRAPHS IN THE PAPERS MY CONTINUAL VISITS ASSURED ME
THAT IT WAS NOT SO BAD AS THAT HIS WIRY CONSTITUTION AND HIS
DETERMINED WILL WERE WORKING WONDERS HE WAS RECOVERING FAST AND I
HAD SUSPICIONS AT TIMES THAT HE WAS REALLY FINDING HIMSELF FASTER
THAN HE PRETENDED EVEN TO ME THERE WAS A CURIOUS SECRETIVE STREAK IN
THE MAN WHICH LED TO MANY DRAMATIC EFFECTS BUT LEFT EVEN HIS CLOSEST
FRIEND GUESSING AS TO WHAT HIS EXACT PLANS MIGHT BE HE PUSHED TO AN
EXTREME THE AXIOM THAT THE ONLY SAFE PLOTTER WAS HE WHO PLOTTED
ALONE I WAS NEARER HIM THAN ANYONE ELSE AND YET I WAS ALWAYS
CONSCIOUS OF THE GAP BETWEEN
ON THE SEVENTH DAY THE STITCHES WERE TAKEN OUT IN SPITE OF WHICH
THERE WAS A REPORT OF ERYSIPELAS IN THE EVENING PAPERS THE SAME
EVENING PAPERS HAD AN ANNOUNCEMENT WHICH I WAS BOUND SICK OR WELL
TO CARRY TO MY FRIEND IT WAS SIMPLY THAT AMONG THE PASSENGERS ON THE
CUNARD BOAT RURITANIA STARTING FROM LIVERPOOL ON FRIDAY WAS THE
BARON ADELBERT GRUNER WHO HAD SOME IMPORTANT FINANCIAL BUSINESS TO
SETTLE IN THE STATES BEFORE HIS IMPENDING WEDDING TO MISS VIOLET DE
MERVILLE ONLY DAUGHTER OF ETC ETC HOLMES LISTENED TO THE NEWS
WITH A COLD CONCENTRATED LOOK UPON HIS PALE FACE WHICH TOLD ME THAT
IT HIT HIM HARD
FRIDAY HE CRIED ONLY THREE CLEAR DAYS I BELIEVE THE RASCAL
WANTS TO PUT HIMSELF OUT OF DANGERS WAY BUT HE WONT WATSON BY
THE LORD HARRY HE WONT NOW WATSON I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR
ME
I AM HERE TO BE USED HOLMES
WELL THEN SPEND THE NEXT TWENTYFOUR HOURS IN AN INTENSIVE STUDY
OF CHINESE POTTERY
HE GAVE NO EXPLANATIONS AND I ASKED FOR NONE BY LONG EXPERIENCE I
HAD LEARNED THE WISDOM OF OBEDIENCE BUT WHEN I HAD LEFT HIS ROOM I
WALKED DOWN BAKER STREET REVOLVING IN MY HEAD HOW ON EARTH I WAS TO
CARRY OUT SO STRANGE AN ORDER FINALLY I DROVE TO THE LONDON LIBRARY
IN ST JAMESS SQUARE PUT THE MATTER TO MY FRIEND LOMAX THE
SUBLIBRARIAN AND DEPARTED TO MY ROOMS WITH A GOODLY VOLUME UNDER MY
ARM
IT IS SAID THAT THE BARRISTER WHO CRAMS UP A CASE WITH SUCH CARE THAT
HE CAN EXAMINE AN EXPERT WITNESS UPON THE MONDAY HAS FORGOTTEN ALL
HIS FORCED KNOWLEDGE BEFORE THE SATURDAY CERTAINLY I SHOULD NOT LIKE
NOW TO POSE AS AN AUTHORITY UPON CERAMICS AND YET ALL THAT EVENING
AND ALL THAT NIGHT WITH A SHORT INTERVAL FOR REST AND ALL NEXT
MORNING I WAS SUCKING IN KNOWLEDGE AND COMMITTING NAMES TO MEMORY
THERE I LEARNED OF THE HALLMARKS OF THE GREAT ARTISTDECORATORS OF
THE MYSTERY OF CYCLICAL DATES THE MARKS OF THE HUNGWU AND THE
BEAUTIES OF THE YUNGLO THE WRITINGS OF TANGYING AND THE GLORIES
OF THE PRIMITIVE PERIOD OF THE SUNG AND THE YUAN I WAS CHARGED WITH
ALL THIS INFORMATION WHEN I CALLED UPON HOLMES NEXT EVENING HE WAS
OUT OF BED NOW THOUGH YOU WOULD NOT HAVE GUESSED IT FROM THE
PUBLISHED REPORTS AND HE SAT WITH HIS MUCHBANDAGED HEAD RESTING
UPON HIS HAND IN THE DEPTH OF HIS FAVOURITE ARMCHAIR
WHY HOLMES I SAID IF ONE BELIEVED THE PAPERS YOU ARE DYING
THAT SAID HE IS THE VERY IMPRESSION WHICH I INTENDED TO CONVEY
AND NOW WATSON HAVE YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSONS
AT LEAST I HAVE TRIED TO
GOOD YOU COULD KEEP UP AN INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION ON THE SUBJECT
I BELIEVE I COULD
THEN HAND ME THAT LITTLE BOX FROM THE MANTELPIECE
HE OPENED THE LID AND TOOK OUT A SMALL OBJECT MOST CAREFULLY WRAPPED
IN SOME FINE EASTERN SILK THIS HE UNFOLDED AND DISCLOSED A DELICATE
LITTLE SAUCER OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DEEPBLUE COLOUR
IT NEEDS CAREFUL HANDLING WATSON THIS IS THE REAL EGGSHELL
POTTERY OF THE MING DYNASTY NO FINER PIECE EVER PASSED THROUGH
CHRISTIES A COMPLETE SET OF THIS WOULD BE WORTH A KINGS RANSOMIN
FACT IT IS DOUBTFUL IF THERE IS A COMPLETE SET OUTSIDE THE IMPERIAL
PALACE OF PEKING THE SIGHT OF THIS WOULD DRIVE A REAL CONNOISSEUR
WILD
WHAT AM I TO DO WITH IT
HOLMES HANDED ME A CARD UPON WHICH WAS PRINTED DR HILL BARTON HALF
MOON STREET
THAT IS YOUR NAME FOR THE EVENING WATSON YOU WILL CALL UPON BARON
GRUNER I KNOW SOMETHING OF HIS HABITS AND AT HALFPAST EIGHT HE
WOULD PROBABLY BE DISENGAGED A NOTE WILL TELL HIM IN ADVANCE THAT
YOU ARE ABOUT TO CALL AND YOU WILL SAY THAT YOU ARE BRINGING HIM A
SPECIMEN OF AN ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE SET OF MING CHINA YOU MAY AS WELL
BE A MEDICAL MAN SINCE THAT IS A PART WHICH YOU CAN PLAY WITHOUT
DUPLICITY YOU ARE A COLLECTOR THIS SET HAS COME YOUR WAY YOU HAVE
HEARD OF THE BARONS INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT AND YOU ARE NOT AVERSE
TO SELLING AT A PRICE
WHAT PRICE
WELL ASKED WATSON YOU WOULD CERTAINLY FALL DOWN BADLY IF YOU DID
NOT KNOW THE VALUE OF YOUR OWN WARES THIS SAUCER WAS GOT FOR ME BY
SIR JAMES AND COMES I UNDERSTAND FROM THE COLLECTION OF HIS
CLIENT YOU WILL NOT EXAGGERATE IF YOU SAY THAT IT COULD HARDLY BE
MATCHED IN THE WORLD
I COULD PERHAPS SUGGEST THAT THE SET SHOULD BE VALUED BY AN EXPERT
EXCELLENT WATSON YOU SCINTILLATE TODAY SUGGEST CHRISTIE OR
SOTHEBY YOUR DELICACY PREVENTS YOUR PUTTING A PRICE FOR YOURSELF
BUT IF HE WONT SEE ME
OH YES HE WILL SEE YOU HE HAS THE COLLECTION MANIA IN ITS MOST
ACUTE FORMAND ESPECIALLY ON THIS SUBJECT ON WHICH HE IS AN
ACKNOWLEDGED AUTHORITY SIT DOWN WATSON AND I WILL DICTATE THE
LETTER NO ANSWER NEEDED YOU WILL MERELY SAY THAT YOU ARE COMING
AND WHY
IT WAS AN ADMIRABLE DOCUMENT SHORT COURTEOUS AND STIMULATING TO
THE CURIOSITY OF THE CONNOISSEUR A DISTRICT MESSENGER WAS DULY
DISPATCHED WITH IT ON THE SAME EVENING WITH THE PRECIOUS SAUCER IN
MY HAND AND THE CARD OF DR HILL BARTON IN MY POCKET I SET OFF ON MY
OWN ADVENTURE
THE BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AND GROUNDS INDICATED THAT BARON GRUNER WAS AS
SIR JAMES HAD SAID A MAN OF CONSIDERABLE WEALTH A LONG WINDING
DRIVE WITH BANKS OF RARE SHRUBS ON EITHER SIDE OPENED OUT INTO A
GREAT GRAVELLED SQUARE ADORNED WITH STATUES THE PLACE HAD BEEN BUILT
BY A SOUTH AFRICAN GOLD KING IN THE DAYS OF THE GREAT BOOM AND THE
LONG LOW HOUSE WITH THE TURRETS AT THE CORNERS THOUGH AN
ARCHITECTURAL NIGHTMARE WAS IMPOSING IN ITS SIZE AND SOLIDITY A
BUTLER WHO WOULD HAVE ADORNED A BENCH OF BISHOPS SHOWED ME IN AND
HANDED ME OVER TO A PLUSHCLAD FOOTMAN WHO USHERED ME INTO THE
BARONS PRESENCE
HE WAS STANDING AT THE OPEN FRONT OF A GREAT CASE WHICH STOOD BETWEEN
THE WINDOWS AND WHICH CONTAINED PART OF HIS CHINESE COLLECTION HE
TURNED AS I ENTERED WITH A SMALL BROWN VASE IN HIS HAND
PRAY SIT DOWN DOCTOR SAID HE I WAS LOOKING OVER MY OWN
TREASURES AND WONDERING WHETHER I COULD REALLY AFFORD TO ADD TO THEM
THIS LITTLE TANG SPECIMEN WHICH DATES FROM THE SEVENTH CENTURY
WOULD PROBABLY INTEREST YOU I AM SURE YOU NEVER SAW FINER
WORKMANSHIP OR A RICHER GLAZE HAVE YOU THE MING SAUCER WITH YOU OF
WHICH YOU SPOKE
I CAREFULLY UNPACKED IT AND HANDED IT TO HIM HE SEATED HIMSELF AT
HIS DESK PULLED OVER THE LAMP FOR IT WAS GROWING DARK AND SET
HIMSELF TO EXAMINE IT AS HE DID SO THE YELLOW LIGHT BEAT UPON HIS
OWN FEATURES AND I WAS ABLE TO STUDY THEM AT MY EASE
HE WAS CERTAINLY A REMARKABLY HANDSOME MAN HIS EUROPEAN REPUTATION
FOR BEAUTY WAS FULLY DESERVED IN FIGURE HE WAS NOT MORE THAN OF
MIDDLE SIZE BUT WAS BUILT UPON GRACEFUL AND ACTIVE LINES HIS FACE
WAS SWARTHY ALMOST ORIENTAL WITH LARGE DARK LANGUOROUS EYES WHICH
MIGHT EASILY HOLD AN IRRESISTIBLE FASCINATION FOR WOMEN HIS HAIR AND
MOUSTACHE WERE RAVEN BLACK THE LATTER SHORT POINTED AND CAREFULLY
WAXED HIS FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND PLEASING SAVE ONLY HIS
STRAIGHT THINLIPPED MOUTH IF EVER I SAW A MURDERERS MOUTH IT WAS
THEREA CRUEL HARD GASH IN THE FACE COMPRESSED INEXORABLE AND
TERRIBLE HE WAS ILLADVISED TO TRAIN HIS MOUSTACHE AWAY FROM IT FOR
IT WAS NATURES DANGERSIGNAL SET AS A WARNING TO HIS VICTIMS HIS
VOICE WAS ENGAGING AND HIS MANNERS PERFECT IN AGE I SHOULD HAVE PUT
HIM AT LITTLE OVER THIRTY THOUGH HIS RECORD AFTERWARDS SHOWED THAT
HE WAS FORTYTWO
VERY FINEVERY FINE INDEED HE SAID AT LAST AND YOU SAY YOU HAVE
A SET OF SIX TO CORRESPOND WHAT PUZZLES ME IS THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE
HEARD OF SUCH MAGNIFICENT SPECIMENS I ONLY KNOW OF ONE IN ENGLAND TO
MATCH THIS AND IT IS CERTAINLY NOT LIKELY TO BE IN THE MARKET WOULD
IT BE INDISCREET IF I WERE TO ASK YOU DR HILL BARTON HOW YOU
OBTAINED THIS
DOES IT REALLY MATTER I ASKED WITH AS CARELESS AN AIR AS I COULD
MUSTER YOU CAN SEE THAT THE PIECE IS GENUINE AND AS TO THE VALUE
I AM CONTENT TO TAKE AN EXPERTS VALUATION
VERY MYSTERIOUS SAID HE WITH A QUICK SUSPICIOUS FLASH OF HIS DARK
EYES IN DEALING WITH OBJECTS OF SUCH VALUE ONE NATURALLY WISHES TO
KNOW ALL ABOUT THE TRANSACTION THAT THE PIECE IS GENUINE IS CERTAIN
I HAVE NO DOUBTS AT ALL ABOUT THAT BUT SUPPOSEI AM BOUND TO TAKE
EVERY POSSIBILITY INTO ACCOUNTTHAT IT SHOULD PROVE AFTERWARDS THAT
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL
I WOULD GUARANTEE YOU AGAINST ANY CLAIM OF THE SORT
THAT OF COURSE WOULD OPEN UP THE QUESTION AS TO WHAT YOUR
GUARANTEE WAS WORTH
MY BANKERS WOULD ANSWER THAT
QUITE SO AND YET THE WHOLE TRANSACTION STRIKES ME AS RATHER
UNUSUAL
YOU CAN DO BUSINESS OR NOT SAID I WITH INDIFFERENCE I HAVE GIVEN
YOU THE FIRST OFFER AS I UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU WERE A CONNOISSEUR BUT
I SHALL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN OTHER QUARTERS
WHO TOLD YOU I WAS A CONNOISSEUR
I WAS AWARE THAT YOU HAD WRITTEN A BOOK UPON THE SUBJECT
HAVE YOU READ THE BOOK
NO
DEAR ME THIS BECOMES MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND
YOU ARE A CONNOISSEUR AND COLLECTOR WITH A VERY VALUABLE PIECE IN
YOUR COLLECTION AND YET YOU HAVE NEVER TROUBLED TO CONSULT THE ONE
BOOK WHICH WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU OF THE REAL MEANING AND VALUE OF WHAT
YOU HELD HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT
I AM A VERY BUSY MAN I AM A DOCTOR IN PRACTICE
THAT IS NO ANSWER IF A MAN HAS A HOBBY HE FOLLOWS IT UP WHATEVER
HIS OTHER PURSUITS MAY BE YOU SAID IN YOUR NOTE THAT YOU WERE A
CONNOISSEUR
SO I AM
MIGHT I ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS TO TEST YOU I AM OBLIGED TO TELL
YOU DOCTORIF YOU ARE INDEED A DOCTORTHAT THE INCIDENT BECOMES
MORE AND MORE SUSPICIOUS I WOULD ASK YOU WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF THE
EMPEROR SHOMU AND HOW DO YOU ASSOCIATE HIM WITH THE SHOSOIN NEAR
NARA DEAR ME DOES THAT PUZZLE YOU TELL ME A LITTLE ABOUT THE
NORTHERN WEI DYNASTY AND ITS PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF CERAMICS
I SPRANG FROM MY CHAIR IN SIMULATED ANGER
THIS IS INTOLERABLE SIR SAID I I CAME HERE TO DO YOU A FAVOUR
AND NOT TO BE EXAMINED AS IF I WERE A SCHOOLBOY MY KNOWLEDGE ON
THESE SUBJECTS MAY BE SECOND ONLY TO YOUR OWN BUT I CERTAINLY SHALL
NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUT IN SO OFFENSIVE A WAY
HE LOOKED AT ME STEADILY THE LANGUOR HAD GONE FROM HIS EYES THEY
SUDDENLY GLARED THERE WAS A GLEAM OF TEETH FROM BETWEEN THOSE CRUEL
LIPS
WHAT IS THE GAME YOU ARE HERE AS A SPY YOU ARE AN EMISSARY OF
HOLMES THIS IS A TRICK THAT YOU ARE PLAYING UPON ME THE FELLOW IS
DYING I HEAR SO HE SENDS HIS TOOLS TO KEEP WATCH UPON ME YOUVE
MADE YOUR WAY IN HERE WITHOUT LEAVE AND BY GOD YOU MAY FIND IT
HARDER TO GET OUT THAN TO GET IN
HE HAD SPRUNG TO HIS FEET AND I STEPPED BACK BRACING MYSELF FOR AN
ATTACK FOR THE MAN WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH RAGE HE MAY HAVE
SUSPECTED ME FROM THE FIRST CERTAINLY THIS CROSSEXAMINATION HAD
SHOWN HIM THE TRUTH BUT IT WAS CLEAR THAT I COULD NOT HOPE TO
DECEIVE HIM HE DIVED HIS HAND INTO A SIDEDRAWER AND RUMMAGED
FURIOUSLY THEN SOMETHING STRUCK UPON HIS EAR FOR HE STOOD LISTENING
INTENTLY
AH HE CRIED AH AND DASHED INTO THE ROOM BEHIND HIM
TWO STEPS TOOK ME TO THE OPEN DOOR AND MY MIND WILL EVER CARRY A
CLEAR PICTURE OF THE SCENE WITHIN THE WINDOW LEADING OUT TO THE
GARDEN WAS WIDE OPEN BESIDE IT LOOKING LIKE SOME TERRIBLE GHOST
HIS HEAD GIRT WITH BLOODY BANDAGES HIS FACE DRAWN AND WHITE STOOD
SHERLOCK HOLMES THE NEXT INSTANT HE WAS THROUGH THE GAP AND I HEARD
THE CRASH OF HIS BODY AMONG THE LAUREL BUSHES OUTSIDE WITH A HOWL OF
RAGE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE RUSHED AFTER HIM TO THE OPEN WINDOW
AND THEN IT WAS DONE IN AN INSTANT AND YET I CLEARLY SAW IT AN
ARMA WOMANS ARMSHOT OUT FROM AMONG THE LEAVES AT THE SAME
INSTANT THE BARON UTTERED A HORRIBLE CRYA YELL WHICH WILL ALWAYS
RING IN MY MEMORY HE CLAPPED HIS TWO HANDS TO HIS FACE AND RUSHED
ROUND THE ROOM BEATING HIS HEAD HORRIBLY AGAINST THE WALLS THEN HE
FELL UPON THE CARPET ROLLING AND WRITHING WHILE SCREAM AFTER SCREAM
RESOUNDED THROUGH THE HOUSE
WATER FOR GODS SAKE WATER WAS HIS CRY
I SEIZED A CARAFE FROM A SIDETABLE AND RUSHED TO HIS AID AT THE
SAME MOMENT THE BUTLER AND SEVERAL FOOTMEN RAN IN FROM THE HALL I
REMEMBER THAT ONE OF THEM FAINTED AS I KNELT BY THE INJURED MAN AND
TURNED THAT AWFUL FACE TO THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP THE VITRIOL WAS
EATING INTO IT EVERYWHERE AND DRIPPING FROM THE EARS AND THE CHIN
ONE EYE WAS ALREADY WHITE AND GLAZED THE OTHER WAS RED AND INFLAMED
THE FEATURES WHICH I HAD ADMIRED A FEW MINUTES BEFORE WERE NOW LIKE
SOME BEAUTIFUL PAINTING OVER WHICH THE ARTIST HAS PASSED A WET AND
FOUL SPONGE THEY WERE BLURRED DISCOLOURED INHUMAN TERRIBLE
IN A FEW WORDS I EXPLAINED EXACTLY WHAT HAD OCCURRED SO FAR AS THE
VITRIOL ATTACK WAS CONCERNED SOME HAD CLIMBED THROUGH THE WINDOW AND
OTHERS HAD RUSHED OUT ON TO THE LAWN BUT IT WAS DARK AND IT HAD
BEGUN TO RAIN BETWEEN HIS SCREAMS THE VICTIM RAGED AND RAVED AGAINST
THE AVENGER IT WAS THAT HELLCAT KITTY WINTER HE CRIED OH THE
SHEDEVIL SHE SHALL PAY FOR IT SHE SHALL PAY OH GOD IN HEAVEN
THIS PAIN IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR
I BATHED HIS FACE IN OIL PUT COTTON WADDING ON THE RAW SURFACES AND
ADMINISTERED A HYPODERMIC OF MORPHIA ALL SUSPICION OF ME HAD PASSED
FROM HIS MIND IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS SHOCK AND HE CLUNG TO MY HANDS
AS IF I MIGHT HAVE THE POWER EVEN YET TO CLEAR THOSE DEADFISH EYES
WHICH GAZED UP AT ME I COULD HAVE WEPT OVER THE RUIN HAD I NOT
REMEMBERED VERY CLEARLY THE VILE LIFE WHICH HAD LED UP TO SO HIDEOUS
A CHANGE IT WAS LOATHSOME TO FEEL THE PAWING OF HIS BURNING HANDS
AND I WAS RELIEVED WHEN HIS FAMILY SURGEON CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY A
SPECIALIST CAME TO RELIEVE ME OF MY CHARGE AN INSPECTOR OF POLICE
HAD ALSO ARRIVED AND TO HIM I HANDED MY REAL CARD IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN USELESS AS WELL AS FOOLISH TO DO OTHERWISE FOR I WAS NEARLY AS
WELL KNOWN BY SIGHT AT THE YARD AS HOLMES HIMSELF THEN I LEFT THAT
HOUSE OF GLOOM AND TERROR WITHIN AN HOUR I WAS AT BAKER STREET
HOLMES WAS SEATED IN HIS FAMILIAR CHAIR LOOKING VERY PALE AND
EXHAUSTED APART FROM HIS INJURIES EVEN HIS IRON NERVES HAD BEEN
SHOCKED BY THE EVENTS OF THE EVENING AND HE LISTENED WITH HORROR TO
MY ACCOUNT OF THE BARONS TRANSFORMATION
THE WAGES OF SIN WATSONTHE WAGES OF SIN SAID HE SOONER OR
LATER IT WILL ALWAYS COME GOD KNOWS THERE WAS SIN ENOUGH HE
ADDED TAKING UP A BROWN VOLUME FROM THE TABLE HERE IS THE BOOK THE
WOMAN TALKED OF IF THIS WILL NOT BREAK OFF THE MARRIAGE NOTHING
EVER COULD BUT IT WILL WATSON IT MUST NO SELFRESPECTING WOMAN
COULD STAND IT
IT IS HIS LOVE DIARY
OR HIS LUST DIARY CALL IT WHAT YOU WILL THE MOMENT THE WOMAN TOLD
US OF IT I REALIZED WHAT A TREMENDOUS WEAPON WAS THERE IF WE COULD
BUT LAY OUR HANDS ON IT I SAID NOTHING AT THE TIME TO INDICATE MY
THOUGHTS FOR THIS WOMAN MIGHT HAVE GIVEN IT AWAY BUT I BROODED OVER
IT THEN THIS ASSAULT UPON ME GAVE ME THE CHANCE OF LETTING THE BARON
THINK THAT NO PRECAUTIONS NEED BE TAKEN AGAINST ME THAT WAS ALL TO
THE GOOD I WOULD HAVE WAITED A LITTLE LONGER BUT HIS VISIT TO
AMERICA FORCED MY HAND HE WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT SO COMPROMISING A
DOCUMENT BEHIND HIM THEREFORE WE HAD TO ACT AT ONCE BURGLARY AT
NIGHT IS IMPOSSIBLE HE TAKES PRECAUTIONS BUT THERE WAS A CHANCE IN
THE EVENING IF I COULD ONLY BE SURE THAT HIS ATTENTION WAS ENGAGED
THAT WAS WHERE YOU AND YOUR BLUE SAUCER CAME IN BUT I HAD TO BE SURE
OF THE POSITION OF THE BOOK AND I KNEW I HAD ONLY A FEW MINUTES IN
WHICH TO ACT FOR MY TIME WAS LIMITED BY YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF CHINESE
POTTERY THEREFORE I GATHERED THE GIRL UP AT THE LAST MOMENT HOW
COULD I GUESS WHAT THE LITTLE PACKET WAS THAT SHE CARRIED SO
CAREFULLY UNDER HER CLOAK I THOUGHT SHE HAD COME ALTOGETHER ON MY
BUSINESS BUT IT SEEMS SHE HAD SOME OF HER OWN
HE GUESSED I CAME FROM YOU
I FEARED HE WOULD BUT YOU HELD HIM IN PLAY JUST LONG ENOUGH FOR ME
TO GET THE BOOK THOUGH NOT LONG ENOUGH FOR AN UNOBSERVED ESCAPE AH
SIR JAMES I AM VERY GLAD YOU HAVE COME
OUR COURTLY FRIEND HAD APPEARED IN ANSWER TO A PREVIOUS SUMMONS HE
LISTENED WITH THE DEEPEST ATTENTION TO HOLMESS ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD
OCCURRED
YOU HAVE DONE WONDERSWONDERS HE CRIED WHEN HE HAD HEARD THE
NARRATIVE BUT IF THESE INJURIES ARE AS TERRIBLE AS DR WATSON
DESCRIBES THEN SURELY OUR PURPOSE OF THWARTING THE MARRIAGE IS
SUFFICIENTLY GAINED WITHOUT THE USE OF THIS HORRIBLE BOOK
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD
WOMEN OF THE DE MERVILLE TYPE DO NOT ACT LIKE THAT SHE WOULD LOVE
HIM THE MORE AS A DISFIGURED MARTYR NO NO IT IS HIS MORAL SIDE
NOT HIS PHYSICAL WHICH WE HAVE TO DESTROY THAT BOOK WILL BRING HER
BACK TO EARTHAND I KNOW NOTHING ELSE THAT COULD IT IS IN HIS OWN
WRITING SHE CANNOT GET PAST IT
SIR JAMES CARRIED AWAY BOTH IT AND THE PRECIOUS SAUCER AS I WAS
MYSELF OVERDUE I WENT DOWN WITH HIM INTO THE STREET A BROUGHAM WAS
WAITING FOR HIM HE SPRANG IN GAVE A HURRIED ORDER TO THE COCKADED
COACHMAN AND DROVE SWIFTLY AWAY HE FLUNG HIS OVERCOAT HALF OUT OF
THE WINDOW TO COVER THE ARMORIAL BEARINGS UPON THE PANEL BUT I HAD
SEEN THEM IN THE GLARE OF OUR FANLIGHT NONE THE LESS I GASPED WITH
SURPRISE THEN I TURNED BACK AND ASCENDED THE STAIR TO HOLMESS ROOM
I HAVE FOUND OUT WHO OUR CLIENT IS I CRIED BURSTING WITH MY GREAT
NEWS WHY HOLMES IT IS
IT IS A LOYAL FRIEND AND A CHIVALROUS GENTLEMAN SAID HOLMES
HOLDING UP A RESTRAINING HAND LET THAT NOW AND FOREVER BE ENOUGH
FOR US
I DO NOT KNOW HOW THE INCRIMINATING BOOK WAS USED SIR JAMES MAY HAVE
MANAGED IT OR IT IS MORE PROBABLE THAT SO DELICATE A TASK WAS
ENTRUSTED TO THE YOUNG LADYS FATHER THE EFFECT AT ANY RATE WAS
ALL THAT COULD BE DESIRED THREE DAYS LATER APPEARED A PARAGRAPH IN
THE MORNING POST TO SAY THAT THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN BARON ADELBERT
GRUNER AND MISS VIOLET DE MERVILLE WOULD NOT TAKE PLACE THE SAME
PAPER HAD THE FIRST POLICECOURT HEARING OF THE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST
MISS KITTY WINTER ON THE GRAVE CHARGE OF VITRIOLTHROWING SUCH
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES CAME OUT IN THE TRIAL THAT THE SENTENCE AS
WILL BE REMEMBERED WAS THE LOWEST THAT WAS POSSIBLE FOR SUCH AN
OFFENCE SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS THREATENED WITH A PROSECUTION FOR
BURGLARY BUT WHEN AN OBJECT IS GOOD AND A CLIENT IS SUFFICIENTLY
ILLUSTRIOUS EVEN THE RIGID BRITISH LAW BECOMES HUMAN AND ELASTIC MY
FRIEND HAS NOT YET STOOD IN THE DOCK
THE BLANCHED SOLDIER
THE IDEAS OF MY FRIEND WATSON THOUGH LIMITED ARE EXCEEDINGLY
PERTINACIOUS FOR A LONG TIME HE HAS WORRIED ME TO WRITE AN
EXPERIENCE OF MY OWN PERHAPS I HAVE RATHER INVITED THIS PERSECUTION
SINCE I HAVE OFTEN HAD OCCASION TO POINT OUT TO HIM HOW SUPERFICIAL
ARE HIS OWN ACCOUNTS AND TO ACCUSE HIM OF PANDERING TO POPULAR TASTE
INSTEAD OF CONFINING HIMSELF RIGIDLY TO FACTS AND FIGURES TRY IT
YOURSELF HOLMES HE HAS RETORTED AND I AM COMPELLED TO ADMIT THAT
HAVING TAKEN MY PEN IN MY HAND I DO BEGIN TO REALIZE THAT THE MATTER
MUST BE PRESENTED IN SUCH A WAY AS MAY INTEREST THE READER THE
FOLLOWING CASE CAN HARDLY FAIL TO DO SO AS IT IS AMONG THE STRANGEST
HAPPENINGS IN MY COLLECTION THOUGH IT CHANCED THAT WATSON HAD NO
NOTE OF IT IN HIS COLLECTION SPEAKING OF MY OLD FRIEND AND
BIOGRAPHER I WOULD TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REMARK THAT IF I BURDEN
MYSELF WITH A COMPANION IN MY VARIOUS LITTLE INQUIRIES IT IS NOT DONE
OUT OF SENTIMENT OR CAPRICE BUT IT IS THAT WATSON HAS SOME
REMARKABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS OWN TO WHICH IN HIS MODESTY HE HAS
GIVEN SMALL ATTENTION AMID HIS EXAGGERATED ESTIMATES OF MY OWN
PERFORMANCES A CONFEDERATE WHO FORESEES YOUR CONCLUSIONS AND COURSE
OF ACTION IS ALWAYS DANGEROUS BUT ONE TO WHOM EACH DEVELOPMENT COMES
AS A PERPETUAL SURPRISE AND TO WHOM THE FUTURE IS ALWAYS A CLOSED
BOOK IS INDEED AN IDEAL HELPMATE
I FIND FROM MY NOTEBOOK THAT IT WAS IN JANUARY JUST AFTER THE
CONCLUSION OF THE BOER WAR THAT I HAD MY VISIT FROM MR JAMES M
DODD A BIG FRESH SUNBURNED UPSTANDING BRITON THE GOOD WATSON HAD
AT THAT TIME DESERTED ME FOR A WIFE THE ONLY SELFISH ACTION WHICH I
CAN RECALL IN OUR ASSOCIATION I WAS ALONE
IT IS MY HABIT TO SIT WITH MY BACK TO THE WINDOW AND TO PLACE MY
VISITORS IN THE OPPOSITE CHAIR WHERE THE LIGHT FALLS FULL UPON THEM
MR JAMES M DODD SEEMED SOMEWHAT AT A LOSS HOW TO BEGIN THE
INTERVIEW I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO HELP HIM FOR HIS SILENCE GAVE ME
MORE TIME FOR OBSERVATION I HAVE FOUND IT WISE TO IMPRESS CLIENTS
WITH A SENSE OF POWER AND SO I GAVE HIM SOME OF MY CONCLUSIONS
FROM SOUTH AFRICA SIR I PERCEIVE
YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH SOME SURPRISE
IMPERIAL YEOMANRY I FANCY
EXACTLY
MIDDLESEX CORPS NO DOUBT
THAT IS SO MR HOLMES YOU ARE A WIZARD
I SMILED AT HIS BEWILDERED EXPRESSION
WHEN A GENTLEMAN OF VIRILE APPEARANCE ENTERS MY ROOM WITH SUCH TAN
UPON HIS FACE AS AN ENGLISH SUN COULD NEVER GIVE AND WITH HIS
HANDKERCHIEF IN HIS SLEEVE INSTEAD OF IN HIS POCKET IT IS NOT
DIFFICULT TO PLACE HIM YOU WEAR A SHORT BEARD WHICH SHOWS THAT YOU
WERE NOT A REGULAR YOU HAVE THE CUT OF A RIDINGMAN AS TO
MIDDLESEX YOUR CARD HAS ALREADY SHOWN ME THAT YOU ARE A STOCKBROKER
FROM THROGMORTON STREET WHAT OTHER REGIMENT WOULD YOU JOIN
YOU SEE EVERYTHING
I SEE NO MORE THAN YOU BUT I HAVE TRAINED MYSELF TO NOTICE WHAT I
SEE HOWEVER MR DODD IT WAS NOT TO DISCUSS THE SCIENCE OF
OBSERVATION THAT YOU CALLED UPON ME THIS MORNING WHAT HAS BEEN
HAPPENING AT TUXBURY OLD PARK
MR HOLMES
MY DEAR SIR THERE IS NO MYSTERY YOUR LETTER CAME WITH THAT
HEADING AND AS YOU FIXED THIS APPOINTMENT IN VERY PRESSING TERMS IT
WAS CLEAR THAT SOMETHING SUDDEN AND IMPORTANT HAD OCCURRED
YES INDEED BUT THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN THE AFTERNOON AND A GOOD
DEAL HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN IF COLONEL EMSWORTH HAD NOT KICKED ME
OUT
KICKED YOU OUT
WELL THAT WAS WHAT IT AMOUNTED TO HE IS A HARD NAIL IS COLONEL
EMSWORTH THE GREATEST MARTINET IN THE ARMY IN HIS DAY AND IT WAS A
DAY OF ROUGH LANGUAGE TOO I COULDNT HAVE STUCK THE COLONEL IF IT
HAD NOT BEEN FOR GODFREYS SAKE
I LIT MY PIPE AND LEANED BACK IN MY CHAIR
PERHAPS YOU WILL EXPLAIN WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
MY CLIENT GRINNED MISCHIEVOUSLY
I HAD GOT INTO THE WAY OF SUPPOSING THAT YOU KNEW EVERYTHING WITHOUT
BEING TOLD SAID HE BUT I WILL GIVE YOU THE FACTS AND I HOPE TO
GOD THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TELL ME WHAT THEY MEAN IVE BEEN AWAKE
ALL NIGHT PUZZLING MY BRAIN AND THE MORE I THINK THE MORE INCREDIBLE
DOES IT BECOME
WHEN I JOINED UP IN JANUARY JUST TWO YEARS AGOYOUNG GODFREY
EMSWORTH HAD JOINED THE SAME SQUADRON HE WAS COLONEL EMSWORTHS ONLY
SONEMSWORTH THE CRIMEAN V CAND HE HAD THE FIGHTING BLOOD IN
HIM SO IT IS NO WONDER HE VOLUNTEERED THERE WAS NOT A FINER LAD IN
THE REGIMENT WE FORMED A FRIENDSHIPTHE SORT OF FRIENDSHIP WHICH
CAN ONLY BE MADE WHEN ONE LIVES THE SAME LIFE AND SHARES THE SAME
JOYS AND SORROWS HE WAS MY MATEAND THAT MEANS A GOOD DEAL IN THE
ARMY WE TOOK THE ROUGH AND THE SMOOTH TOGETHER FOR A YEAR OF HARD
FIGHTING THEN HE WAS HIT WITH A BULLET FROM AN ELEPHANT GUN IN THE
ACTION NEAR DIAMOND HILL OUTSIDE PRETORIA I GOT ONE LETTER FROM THE
HOSPITAL AT CAPE TOWN AND ONE FROM SOUTHAMPTON SINCE THEN NOT A
WORDNOT ONE WORD MR HOLMES FOR SIX MONTHS AND MORE AND HE MY
CLOSEST PAL
WELL WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER AND WE ALL GOT BACK I WROTE TO HIS
FATHER AND ASKED WHERE GODFREY WAS NO ANSWER I WAITED A BIT AND
THEN I WROTE AGAIN THIS TIME I HAD A REPLY SHORT AND GRUFF GODFREY
HAD GONE ON A VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD AND IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT HE
WOULD BE BACK FOR A YEAR THAT WAS ALL
I WASNT SATISFIED MR HOLMES THE WHOLE THING SEEMED TO ME SO
DAMNED UNNATURAL HE WAS A GOOD LAD AND HE WOULD NOT DROP A PAL LIKE
THAT IT WAS NOT LIKE HIM THEN AGAIN I HAPPENED TO KNOW THAT HE
WAS HEIR TO A LOT OF MONEY AND ALSO THAT HIS FATHER AND HE DID NOT
ALWAYS HIT IT OFF TOO WELL THE OLD MAN WAS SOMETIMES A BULLY AND
YOUNG GODFREY HAD TOO MUCH SPIRIT TO STAND IT NO I WASNT
SATISFIED AND I DETERMINED THAT I WOULD GET TO THE ROOT OF THE
MATTER IT HAPPENED HOWEVER THAT MY OWN AFFAIRS NEEDED A LOT OF
STRAIGHTENING OUT AFTER TWO YEARS ABSENCE AND SO IT IS ONLY THIS
WEEK THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE UP GODFREYS CASE AGAIN BUT SINCE
I HAVE TAKEN IT UP I MEAN TO DROP EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO SEE IT
THROUGH
MR JAMES M DODD APPEARED TO BE THE SORT OF PERSON WHOM IT WOULD BE
BETTER TO HAVE AS A FRIEND THAN AS AN ENEMY HIS BLUE EYES WERE STERN
AND HIS SQUARE JAW HAD SET HARD AS HE SPOKE
WELL WHAT HAVE YOU DONE I ASKED
MY FIRST MOVE WAS TO GET DOWN TO HIS HOME TUXBURY OLD PARK NEAR
BEDFORD AND TO SEE FOR MYSELF HOW THE GROUND LAY I WROTE TO THE
MOTHER THEREFOREI HAD HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF THE CURMUDGEON OF A
FATHERAND I MADE A CLEAN FRONTAL ATTACK GODFREY WAS MY CHUM I HAD
A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST WHICH I MIGHT TELL HER OF OUR COMMON
EXPERIENCES I SHOULD BE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WOULD THERE BE ANY
OBJECTION ET CETERA IN REPLY I HAD QUITE AN AMIABLE ANSWER FROM HER
AND AN OFFER TO PUT ME UP FOR THE NIGHT THAT WAS WHAT TOOK ME DOWN
ON MONDAY
TUXBURY OLD HALL IS INACCESSIBLEFIVE MILES FROM ANYWHERE THERE
WAS NO TRAP AT THE STATION SO I HAD TO WALK CARRYING MY SUITCASE
AND IT WAS NEARLY DARK BEFORE I ARRIVED IT IS A GREAT WANDERING
HOUSE STANDING IN A CONSIDERABLE PARK I SHOULD JUDGE IT WAS OF ALL
SORTS OF AGES AND STYLES STARTING ON A HALFTIMBERED ELIZABETHAN
FOUNDATION AND ENDING IN A VICTORIAN PORTICO INSIDE IT WAS ALL
PANELLING AND TAPESTRY AND HALFEFFACED OLD PICTURES A HOUSE OF
SHADOWS AND MYSTERY THERE WAS A BUTLER OLD RALPH WHO SEEMED ABOUT
THE SAME AGE AS THE HOUSE AND THERE WAS HIS WIFE WHO MIGHT HAVE
BEEN OLDER SHE HAD BEEN GODFREYS NURSE AND I HAD HEARD HIM SPEAK
OF HER AS SECOND ONLY TO HIS MOTHER IN HIS AFFECTIONS SO I WAS DRAWN
TO HER IN SPITE OF HER QUEER APPEARANCE THE MOTHER I LIKED ALSOA
GENTLE LITTLE WHITE MOUSE OF A WOMAN IT WAS ONLY THE COLONEL HIMSELF
WHOM I BARRED
WE HAD A BIT OF BARNEY RIGHT AWAY AND I SHOULD HAVE WALKED BACK TO
THE STATION IF I HAD NOT FELT THAT IT MIGHT BE PLAYING HIS GAME FOR
ME TO DO SO I WAS SHOWN STRAIGHT INTO HIS STUDY AND THERE I FOUND
HIM A HUGE BOWBACKED MAN WITH A SMOKY SKIN AND A STRAGGLING GRAY
BEARD SEATED BEHIND HIS LITTERED DESK A REDVEINED NOSE JUTTED OUT
LIKE A VULTURES BEAK AND TWO FIERCE GRAY EYES GLARED AT ME FROM
UNDER TUFTED BROWS I COULD UNDERSTAND NOW WHY GODFREY SELDOM SPOKE
OF HIS FATHER
WELL SIR SAID HE IN A RASPING VOICE I SHOULD BE INTERESTED TO
KNOW THE REAL REASONS FOR THIS VISIT
I ANSWERED THAT I HAD EXPLAINED THEM IN MY LETTER TO HIS WIFE
YES YES YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD KNOWN GODFREY IN AFRICA WE HAVE
OF COURSE ONLY YOUR WORD FOR THAT
I HAVE HIS LETTERS TO ME IN MY POCKET
KINDLY LET ME SEE THEM
HE GLANCED AT THE TWO WHICH I HANDED HIM AND THEN HE TOSSED THEM
BACK
WELL WHAT THEN HE ASKED
I WAS FOND OF YOUR SON GODFREY SIR MANY TIES AND MEMORIES UNITED
US IS IT NOT NATURAL THAT I SHOULD WONDER AT HIS SUDDEN SILENCE AND
SHOULD WISH TO KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM
I HAVE SOME RECOLLECTIONS SIR THAT I HAD ALREADY CORRESPONDED
WITH YOU AND HAD TOLD YOU WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM HE HAS GONE UPON A
VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD HIS HEALTH WAS IN A POOR WAY AFTER HIS
AFRICAN EXPERIENCES AND BOTH HIS MOTHER AND I WERE OF OPINION THAT
COMPLETE REST AND CHANGE WERE NEEDED KINDLY PASS THAT EXPLANATION ON
TO ANY OTHER FRIENDS WHO MAY BE INTERESTED IN THE MATTER
CERTAINLY I ANSWERED BUT PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO
LET ME HAVE THE NAME OF THE STEAMER AND OF THE LINE BY WHICH HE
SAILED TOGETHER WITH THE DATE I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO GET A LETTER THROUGH TO HIM
MY REQUEST SEEMED BOTH TO PUZZLE AND TO IRRITATE MY HOST HIS GREAT
EYEBROWS CAME DOWN OVER HIS EYES AND HE TAPPED HIS FINGERS
IMPATIENTLY ON THE TABLE HE LOOKED UP AT LAST WITH THE EXPRESSION OF
ONE WHO HAS SEEN HIS ADVERSARY MAKE A DANGEROUS MOVE AT CHESS AND
HAS DECIDED HOW TO MEET IT
MANY PEOPLE MR DODD SAID HE WOULD TAKE OFFENCE AT YOUR
INFERNAL PERTINACITY AND WOULD THINK THAT THIS INSISTENCE HAD REACHED
THE POINT OF DAMNED IMPERTINENCE
YOU MUST PUT IT DOWN SIR TO MY REAL LOVE FOR YOUR SON
EXACTLY I HAVE ALREADY MADE EVERY ALLOWANCE UPON THAT SCORE I
MUST ASK YOU HOWEVER TO DROP THESE INQUIRIES EVERY FAMILY HAS ITS
OWN INNER KNOWLEDGE AND ITS OWN MOTIVES WHICH CANNOT ALWAYS BE MADE
CLEAR TO OUTSIDERS HOWEVER WELLINTENTIONED MY WIFE IS ANXIOUS TO
HEAR SOMETHING OF GODFREYS PAST WHICH YOU ARE IN A POSITION TO TELL
HER BUT I WOULD ASK YOU TO LET THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE ALONE
SUCH INQUIRIES SERVE NO USEFUL PURPOSE SIR AND PLACE US IN A
DELICATE AND DIFFICULT POSITION
SO I CAME TO A DEAD END MR HOLMES THERE WAS NO GETTING PAST IT I
COULD ONLY PRETEND TO ACCEPT THE SITUATION AND REGISTER A VOW
INWARDLY THAT I WOULD NEVER REST UNTIL MY FRIENDS FATE HAD BEEN
CLEARED UP IT WAS A DULL EVENING WE DINED QUIETLY THE THREE OF US
IN A GLOOMY FADED OLD ROOM THE LADY QUESTIONED ME EAGERLY ABOUT HER
SON BUT THE OLD MAN SEEMED MOROSE AND DEPRESSED I WAS SO BORED BY
THE WHOLE PROCEEDING THAT I MADE AN EXCUSE AS SOON AS I DECENTLY
COULD AND RETIRED TO MY BEDROOM IT WAS A LARGE BARE ROOM ON THE
GROUND FLOOR AS GLOOMY AS THE REST OF THE HOUSE BUT AFTER A YEAR OF
SLEEPING UPON THE VELDT MR HOLMES ONE IS NOT TOO PARTICULAR ABOUT
ONES QUARTERS I OPENED THE CURTAINS AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE GARDEN
REMARKING THAT IT WAS A FINE NIGHT WITH A BRIGHT HALFMOON THEN I
SAT DOWN BY THE ROARING FIRE WITH THE LAMP ON A TABLE BESIDE ME AND
ENDEAVOURED TO DISTRACT MY MIND WITH A NOVEL I WAS INTERRUPTED
HOWEVER BY RALPH THE OLD BUTLER WHO CAME IN WITH A FRESH SUPPLY OF
COALS
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT RUN SHORT IN THE NIGHTTIME SIR IT IS BITTER
WEATHER AND THESE ROOMS ARE COLD
HE HESITATED BEFORE LEAVING THE ROOM AND WHEN I LOOKED ROUND HE WAS
STANDING FACING ME WITH A WISTFUL LOOK UPON HIS WRINKLED FACE
BEG YOUR PARDON SIR BUT I COULD NOT HELP HEARING WHAT YOU SAID OF
YOUNG MASTER GODFREY AT DINNER YOU KNOW SIR THAT MY WIFE NURSED
HIM AND SO I MAY SAY I AM HIS FOSTERFATHER ITS NATURAL WE SHOULD
TAKE AN INTEREST AND YOU SAY HE CARRIED HIMSELF WELL SIR
THERE WAS NO BRAVER MAN IN THE REGIMENT HE PULLED ME OUT ONCE FROM
UNDER THE RIFLES OF THE BOERS OR MAYBE I SHOULD NOT BE HERE
THE OLD BUTLER RUBBED HIS SKINNY HANDS
YES SIR YES THAT IS MASTER GODFREY ALL OVER HE WAS ALWAYS
COURAGEOUS THERES NOT A TREE IN THE PARK SIR THAT HE HAS NOT
CLIMBED NOTHING WOULD STOP HIM HE WAS A FINE BOYAND OH SIR HE
WAS A FINE MAN
I SPRANG TO MY FEET
LOOK HERE I CRIED YOU SAY HE WAS YOU SPEAK AS IF HE WERE DEAD
WHAT IS ALL THIS MYSTERY WHAT HAS BECOME OF GODFREY EMSWORTH
I GRIPPED THE OLD MAN BY THE SHOULDER BUT HE SHRANK AWAY
I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SIR ASK THE MASTER ABOUT MASTER
GODFREY HE KNOWS IT IS NOT FOR ME TO INTERFERE
HE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM BUT I HELD HIS ARM
LISTEN I SAID YOU ARE GOING TO ANSWER ONE QUESTION BEFORE YOU
LEAVE IF I HAVE TO HOLD YOU ALL NIGHT IS GODFREY DEAD
HE COULD NOT FACE MY EYES HE WAS LIKE A MAN HYPNOTIZED THE ANSWER
WAS DRAGGED FROM HIS LIPS IT WAS A TERRIBLE AND UNEXPECTED ONE
I WISH TO GOD HE WAS HE CRIED AND TEARING HIMSELF FREE HE
DASHED FROM THE ROOM
YOU WILL THINK MR HOLMES THAT I RETURNED TO MY CHAIR IN NO VERY
HAPPY STATE OF MIND THE OLD MANS WORDS SEEMED TO ME TO BEAR ONLY
ONE INTERPRETATION CLEARLY MY POOR FRIEND HAD BECOME INVOLVED IN
SOME CRIMINAL OR AT THE LEAST DISREPUTABLE TRANSACTION WHICH
TOUCHED THE FAMILY HONOUR THAT STERN OLD MAN HAD SENT HIS SON AWAY
AND HIDDEN HIM FROM THE WORLD LEST SOME SCANDAL SHOULD COME TO LIGHT
GODFREY WAS A RECKLESS FELLOW HE WAS EASILY INFLUENCED BY THOSE
AROUND HIM NO DOUBT HE HAD FALLEN INTO BAD HANDS AND BEEN MISLED TO
HIS RUIN IT WAS A PITEOUS BUSINESS IF IT WAS INDEED SO BUT EVEN
NOW IT WAS MY DUTY TO HUNT HIM OUT AND SEE IF I COULD AID HIM I WAS
ANXIOUSLY PONDERING THE MATTER WHEN I LOOKED UP AND THERE WAS
GODFREY EMSWORTH STANDING BEFORE ME
MY CLIENT HAD PAUSED AS ONE IN DEEP EMOTION
PRAY CONTINUE I SAID YOUR PROBLEM PRESENTS SOME VERY UNUSUAL
FEATURES
HE WAS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW MR HOLMES WITH HIS FACE PRESSED AGAINST
THE GLASS I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I LOOKED OUT AT THE NIGHT WHEN I DID
SO I LEFT THE CURTAINS PARTLY OPEN HIS FIGURE WAS FRAMED IN THIS
GAP THE WINDOW CAME DOWN TO THE GROUND AND I COULD SEE THE WHOLE
LENGTH OF IT BUT IT WAS HIS FACE WHICH HELD MY GAZE HE WAS DEADLY
PALENEVER HAVE I SEEN A MAN SO WHITE I RECKON GHOSTS MAY LOOK LIKE
THAT BUT HIS EYES MET MINE AND THEY WERE THE EYES OF A LIVING MAN
HE SPRANG BACK WHEN HE SAW THAT I WAS LOOKING AT HIM AND HE VANISHED
INTO THE DARKNESS
THERE WAS SOMETHING SHOCKING ABOUT THE MAN MR HOLMES IT WASNT
MERELY THAT GHASTLY FACE GLIMMERING AS WHITE AS CHEESE IN THE
DARKNESS IT WAS MORE SUBTLE THAN THATSOMETHING SLINKING SOMETHING
FURTIVE SOMETHING GUILTY SOMETHING VERY UNLIKE THE FRANK MANLY
LAD THAT I HAD KNOWN IT LEFT A FEELING OF HORROR IN MY MIND
BUT WHEN A MAN HAS BEEN SOLDIERING FOR A YEAR OR TWO WITH BROTHER
BOER AS A PLAYMATE HE KEEPS HIS NERVE AND ACTS QUICKLY GODFREY HAD
HARDLY VANISHED BEFORE I WAS AT THE WINDOW THERE WAS AN AWKWARD
CATCH AND I WAS SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE I COULD THROW IT UP THEN I
NIPPED THROUGH AND RAN DOWN THE GARDEN PATH IN THE DIRECTION THAT I
THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN
IT WAS A LONG PATH AND THE LIGHT WAS NOT VERY GOOD BUT IT SEEMED TO
ME SOMETHING WAS MOVING AHEAD OF ME I RAN ON AND CALLED HIS NAME
BUT IT WAS NO USE WHEN I GOT TO THE END OF THE PATH THERE WERE
SEVERAL OTHERS BRANCHING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS TO VARIOUS
OUTHOUSES I STOOD HESITATING AND AS I DID SO I HEARD DISTINCTLY THE
SOUND OF A CLOSING DOOR IT WAS NOT BEHIND ME IN THE HOUSE BUT AHEAD
OF ME SOMEWHERE IN THE DARKNESS THAT WAS ENOUGH MR HOLMES TO
ASSURE ME THAT WHAT I HAD SEEN WAS NOT A VISION GODFREY HAD RUN AWAY
FROM ME AND HE HAD SHUT A DOOR BEHIND HIM OF THAT I WAS CERTAIN
THERE WAS NOTHING MORE I COULD DO AND I SPENT AN UNEASY NIGHT
TURNING THE MATTER OVER IN MY MIND AND TRYING TO FIND SOME THEORY
WHICH WOULD COVER THE FACTS NEXT DAY I FOUND THE COLONEL RATHER MORE
CONCILIATORY AND AS HIS WIFE REMARKED THAT THERE WERE SOME PLACES OF
INTEREST IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT GAVE ME AN OPENING TO ASK WHETHER
MY PRESENCE FOR ONE MORE NIGHT WOULD INCOMMODE THEM A SOMEWHAT
GRUDGING ACQUIESCENCE FROM THE OLD MAN GAVE ME A CLEAR DAY IN WHICH
TO MAKE MY OBSERVATIONS I WAS ALREADY PERFECTLY CONVINCED THAT
GODFREY WAS IN HIDING SOMEWHERE NEAR BUT WHERE AND WHY REMAINED TO
BE SOLVED
THE HOUSE WAS SO LARGE AND SO RAMBLING THAT A REGIMENT MIGHT BE HID
AWAY IN IT AND NO ONE THE WISER IF THE SECRET LAY THERE IT WAS
DIFFICULT FOR ME TO PENETRATE IT BUT THE DOOR WHICH I HAD HEARD
CLOSE WAS CERTAINLY NOT IN THE HOUSE I MUST EXPLORE THE GARDEN AND
SEE WHAT I COULD FIND THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN THE WAY FOR THE
OLD PEOPLE WERE BUSY IN THEIR OWN FASHION AND LEFT ME TO MY OWN
DEVICES
THERE WERE SEVERAL SMALL OUTHOUSES BUT AT THE END OF THE GARDEN
THERE WAS A DETACHED BUILDING OF SOME SIZELARGE ENOUGH FOR A
GARDENERS OR A GAMEKEEPERS RESIDENCE COULD THIS BE THE PLACE
WHENCE THE SOUND OF THAT SHUTTING DOOR HAD COME I APPROACHED IT IN A
CARELESS FASHION AS THOUGH I WERE STROLLING AIMLESSLY ROUND THE
GROUNDS AS I DID SO A SMALL BRISK BEARDED MAN IN A BLACK COAT AND
BOWLER HATNOT AT ALL THE GARDENER TYPECAME OUT OF THE DOOR TO MY
SURPRISE HE LOCKED IT AFTER HIM AND PUT THE KEY IN HIS POCKET THEN
HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SOME SURPRISE ON HIS FACE
ARE YOU A VISITOR HERE HE ASKED
I EXPLAINED THAT I WAS AND THAT I WAS A FRIEND OF GODFREYS
WHAT A PITY THAT HE SHOULD BE AWAY ON HIS TRAVELS FOR HE WOULD
HAVE SO LIKED TO SEE ME I CONTINUED
QUITE SO EXACTLY SAID HE WITH A RATHER GUILTY AIR NO DOUBT YOU
WILL RENEW YOUR VISIT AT SOME MORE PROPITIOUS TIME HE PASSED ON
BUT WHEN I TURNED I OBSERVED THAT HE WAS STANDING WATCHING ME
HALFCONCEALED BY THE LAURELS AT THE FAR END OF THE GARDEN
I HAD A GOOD LOOK AT THE LITTLE HOUSE AS I PASSED IT BUT THE
WINDOWS WERE HEAVILY CURTAINED AND SO FAR AS ONE COULD SEE IT WAS
EMPTY I MIGHT SPOIL MY OWN GAME AND EVEN BE ORDERED OFF THE PREMISES
IF I WERE TOO AUDACIOUS FOR I WAS STILL CONSCIOUS THAT I WAS BEING
WATCHED THEREFORE I STROLLED BACK TO THE HOUSE AND WAITED FOR NIGHT
BEFORE I WENT ON WITH MY INQUIRY WHEN ALL WAS DARK AND QUIET I
SLIPPED OUT OF MY WINDOW AND MADE MY WAY AS SILENTLY AS POSSIBLE TO
THE MYSTERIOUS LODGE
I HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS HEAVILY CURTAINED BUT NOW I FOUND THAT THE
WINDOWS WERE SHUTTERED AS WELL SOME LIGHT HOWEVER WAS BREAKING
THROUGH ONE OF THEM SO I CONCENTRATED MY ATTENTION UPON THIS I WAS
IN LUCK FOR THE CURTAIN HAD NOT BEEN QUITE CLOSED AND THERE WAS A
CRACK IN THE SHUTTER SO THAT I COULD SEE THE INSIDE OF THE ROOM IT
WAS A CHEERY PLACE ENOUGH A BRIGHT LAMP AND A BLAZING FIRE OPPOSITE
TO ME WAS SEATED THE LITTLE MAN WHOM I HAD SEEN IN THE MORNING HE
WAS SMOKING A PIPE AND READING A PAPER
WHAT PAPER I ASKED
MY CLIENT SEEMED ANNOYED AT THE INTERRUPTION OF HIS NARRATIVE
CAN IT MATTER HE ASKED
IT IS MOST ESSENTIAL
I REALLY TOOK NO NOTICE
POSSIBLY YOU OBSERVED WHETHER IT WAS A BROADLEAFED PAPER OR OF THAT
SMALLER TYPE WHICH ONE ASSOCIATES WITH WEEKLIES
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT IT WAS NOT LARGE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE
SPECTATOR HOWEVER I HAD LITTLE THOUGHT TO SPARE UPON SUCH DETAILS
FOR A SECOND MAN WAS SEATED WITH HIS BACK TO THE WINDOW AND I COULD
SWEAR THAT THIS SECOND MAN WAS GODFREY I COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE BUT
I KNEW THE FAMILIAR SLOPE OF HIS SHOULDERS HE WAS LEANING UPON HIS
ELBOW IN AN ATTITUDE OF GREAT MELANCHOLY HIS BODY TURNED TOWARDS THE
FIRE I WAS HESITATING AS TO WHAT I SHOULD DO WHEN THERE WAS A SHARP
TAP ON MY SHOULDER AND THERE WAS COLONEL EMSWORTH BESIDE ME
THIS WAY SIR SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE HE WALKED IN SILENCE TO THE
HOUSE AND I FOLLOWED HIM INTO MY OWN BEDROOM HE HAD PICKED UP A
TIMETABLE IN THE HALL
THERE IS A TRAIN TO LONDON AT SAID HE THE TRAP WILL BE AT
THE DOOR AT EIGHT
HE WAS WHITE WITH RAGE AND INDEED I FELT MYSELF IN SO DIFFICULT A
POSITION THAT I COULD ONLY STAMMER OUT A FEW INCOHERENT APOLOGIES IN
WHICH I TRIED TO EXCUSE MYSELF BY URGING MY ANXIETY FOR MY FRIEND
THE MATTER WILL NOT BEAR DISCUSSION SAID HE ABRUPTLY YOU HAVE
MADE A MOST DAMNABLE INTRUSION INTO THE PRIVACY OF OUR FAMILY YOU
WERE HERE AS A GUEST AND YOU HAVE BECOME A SPY I HAVE NOTHING MORE
TO SAY SIR SAVE THAT I HAVE NO WISH EVER TO SEE YOU AGAIN
AT THIS I LOST MY TEMPER MR HOLMES AND I SPOKE WITH SOME WARMTH
I HAVE SEEN YOUR SON AND I AM CONVINCED THAT FOR SOME REASON OF
YOUR OWN YOU ARE CONCEALING HIM FROM THE WORLD I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOUR MOTIVES ARE IN CUTTING HIM OFF IN THIS FASHION BUT I AM SURE
THAT HE IS NO LONGER A FREE AGENT I WARN YOU COLONEL EMSWORTH THAT
UNTIL I AM ASSURED AS TO THE SAFETY AND WELLBEING OF MY FRIEND I
SHALL NEVER DESIST IN MY EFFORTS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MYSTERY
AND I SHALL CERTAINLY NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO BE INTIMIDATED BY ANYTHING
WHICH YOU MAY SAY OR DO
THE OLD FELLOW LOOKED DIABOLICAL AND I REALLY THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT
TO ATTACK ME I HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS A GAUNT FIERCE OLD GIANT AND
THOUGH I AM NO WEAKLING I MIGHT HAVE BEEN HARD PUT TO IT TO HOLD MY
OWN AGAINST HIM HOWEVER AFTER A LONG GLARE OF RAGE HE TURNED UPON
HIS HEEL AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM FOR MY PART I TOOK THE
APPOINTED TRAIN IN THE MORNING WITH THE FULL INTENTION OF COMING
STRAIGHT TO YOU AND ASKING FOR YOUR ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE AT THE
APPOINTMENT FOR WHICH I HAD ALREADY WRITTEN
SUCH WAS THE PROBLEM WHICH MY VISITOR LAID BEFORE ME IT PRESENTED
AS THE ASTUTE READER WILL HAVE ALREADY PERCEIVED FEW DIFFICULTIES IN
ITS SOLUTION FOR A VERY LIMITED CHOICE OF ALTERNATIVES MUST GET TO
THE ROOT OF THE MATTER STILL ELEMENTARY AS IT WAS THERE WERE
POINTS OF INTEREST AND NOVELTY ABOUT IT WHICH MAY EXCUSE MY PLACING
IT UPON RECORD I NOW PROCEEDED USING MY FAMILIAR METHOD OF LOGICAL
ANALYSIS TO NARROW DOWN THE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
THE SERVANTS I ASKED HOW MANY WERE IN THE HOUSE
TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THERE WERE ONLY THE OLD BUTLER AND HIS
WIFE THEY SEEMED TO LIVE IN THE SIMPLEST FASHION
THERE WAS NO SERVANT THEN IN THE DETACHED HOUSE
NONE UNLESS THE LITTLE MAN WITH THE BEARD ACTED AS SUCH HE SEEMED
HOWEVER TO BE QUITE A SUPERIOR PERSON
THAT SEEMS VERY SUGGESTIVE HAD YOU ANY INDICATION THAT FOOD WAS
CONVEYED FROM THE ONE HOUSE TO THE OTHER
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT I DID SEE OLD RALPH CARRYING A BASKET DOWN
THE GARDEN WALK AND GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF THIS HOUSE THE IDEA OF
FOOD DID NOT OCCUR TO ME AT THE MOMENT
DID YOU MAKE ANY LOCAL INQUIRIES
YES I DID I SPOKE TO THE STATIONMASTER AND ALSO TO THE INNKEEPER
IN THE VILLAGE I SIMPLY ASKED IF THEY KNEW ANYTHING OF MY OLD
COMRADE GODFREY EMSWORTH BOTH OF THEM ASSURED ME THAT HE HAD GONE
FOR A VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD HE HAD COME HOME AND THEN HAD ALMOST AT
ONCE STARTED OFF AGAIN THE STORY WAS EVIDENTLY UNIVERSALLY
ACCEPTED
YOU SAID NOTHING OF YOUR SUSPICIONS
NOTHING
THAT WAS VERY WISE THE MATTER SHOULD CERTAINLY BE INQUIRED INTO I
WILL GO BACK WITH YOU TO TUXBURY OLD PARK
TODAY
IT HAPPENED THAT AT THE MOMENT I WAS CLEARING UP THE CASE WHICH MY
FRIEND WATSON HAS DESCRIBED AS THAT OF THE ABBEY SCHOOL IN WHICH THE
DUKE OF GREYMINSTER WAS SO DEEPLY INVOLVED I HAD ALSO A COMMISSION
FROM THE SULTAN OF TURKEY WHICH CALLED FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION AS
POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE GRAVEST KIND MIGHT ARISE FROM ITS
NEGLECT THEREFORE IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT WEEK
AS MY DIARY RECORDS THAT I WAS ABLE TO START FORTH ON MY MISSION TO
BEDFORDSHIRE IN COMPANY WITH MR JAMES M DODD AS WE DROVE TO EUSTON
WE PICKED UP A GRAVE AND TACITURN GENTLEMAN OF IRONGRAY ASPECT WITH
WHOM I HAD MADE THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS
THIS IS AN OLD FRIEND SAID I TO DODD IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HIS
PRESENCE MAY BE ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY AND ON THE OTHER HAND IT MAY
BE ESSENTIAL IT IS NOT NECESSARY AT THE PRESENT STAGE TO GO FURTHER
INTO THE MATTER
THE NARRATIVES OF WATSON HAVE ACCUSTOMED THE READER NO DOUBT TO THE
FACT THAT I DO NOT WASTE WORDS OR DISCLOSE MY THOUGHTS WHILE A CASE
IS ACTUALLY UNDER CONSIDERATION DODD SEEMED SURPRISED BUT NOTHING
MORE WAS SAID AND THE THREE OF US CONTINUED OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER IN
THE TRAIN I ASKED DODD ONE MORE QUESTION WHICH I WISHED OUR COMPANION
TO HEAR
YOU SAY THAT YOU SAW YOUR FRIENDS FACE QUITE CLEARLY AT THE WINDOW
SO CLEARLY THAT YOU ARE SURE OF HIS IDENTITY
I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT WHATEVER HIS NOSE WAS PRESSED AGAINST THE
GLASS THE LAMPLIGHT SHONE FULL UPON HIM
IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SOMEONE RESEMBLING HIM
NO NO IT WAS HE
BUT YOU SAY HE WAS CHANGED
ONLY IN COLOUR HIS FACE WASHOW SHALL I DESCRIBE ITIT WAS OF A
FISHBELLY WHITENESS IT WAS BLEACHED
WAS IT EQUALLY PALE ALL OVER
I THINK NOT IT WAS HIS BROW WHICH I SAW SO CLEARLY AS IT WAS
PRESSED AGAINST THE WINDOW
DID YOU CALL TO HIM
I WAS TOO STARTLED AND HORRIFIED FOR THE MOMENT THEN I PURSUED HIM
AS I HAVE TOLD YOU BUT WITHOUT RESULT
MY CASE WAS PRACTICALLY COMPLETE AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE SMALL
INCIDENT NEEDED TO ROUND IT OFF WHEN AFTER A CONSIDERABLE DRIVE WE
ARRIVED AT THE STRANGE OLD RAMBLING HOUSE WHICH MY CLIENT HAD
DESCRIBED IT WAS RALPH THE ELDERLY BUTLER WHO OPENED THE DOOR I
HAD REQUISITIONED THE CARRIAGE FOR THE DAY AND HAD ASKED MY ELDERLY
FRIEND TO REMAIN WITHIN IT UNLESS WE SHOULD SUMMON HIM RALPH A
LITTLE WRINKLED OLD FELLOW WAS IN THE CONVENTIONAL COSTUME OF BLACK
COAT AND PEPPERANDSALT TROUSERS WITH ONLY ONE CURIOUS VARIANT HE
WORE BROWN LEATHER GLOVES WHICH AT SIGHT OF US HE INSTANTLY SHUFFLED
OFF LAYING THEM DOWN ON THE HALLTABLE AS WE PASSED IN I HAVE AS
MY FRIEND WATSON MAY HAVE REMARKED AN ABNORMALLY ACUTE SET OF
SENSES AND A FAINT BUT INCISIVE SCENT WAS APPARENT IT SEEMED TO
CENTRE ON THE HALLTABLE I TURNED PLACED MY HAT THERE KNOCKED IT
OFF STOOPED TO PICK IT UP AND CONTRIVED TO BRING MY NOSE WITHIN A
FOOT OF THE GLOVES YES IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY FROM THEM THAT THE
CURIOUS TARRY ODOUR WAS OOZING I PASSED ON INTO THE STUDY WITH MY
CASE COMPLETE ALAS THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO SHOW MY HAND SO WHEN I
TELL MY OWN STORY IT WAS BY CONCEALING SUCH LINKS IN THE CHAIN THAT
WATSON WAS ENABLED TO PRODUCE HIS MERETRICIOUS FINALES
COLONEL EMSWORTH WAS NOT IN HIS ROOM BUT HE CAME QUICKLY ENOUGH ON
RECEIPT OF RALPHS MESSAGE WE HEARD HIS QUICK HEAVY STEP IN THE
PASSAGE THE DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN AND HE RUSHED IN WITH BRISTLING
BEARD AND TWISTED FEATURES AS TERRIBLE AN OLD MAN AS EVER I HAVE
SEEN HE HELD OUR CARDS IN HIS HAND AND HE TORE THEM UP AND STAMPED
ON THE FRAGMENTS
HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU YOU INFERNAL BUSYBODY THAT YOU ARE WARNED OFF
THE PREMISES NEVER DARE TO SHOW YOUR DAMNED FACE HERE AGAIN IF YOU
ENTER AGAIN WITHOUT MY LEAVE I SHALL BE WITHIN MY RIGHTS IF I USE
VIOLENCE ILL SHOOT YOU SIR BY GOD I WILL AS TO YOU SIR
TURNING UPON ME I EXTEND THE SAME WARNING TO YOU I AM FAMILIAR
WITH YOUR IGNOBLE PROFESSION BUT YOU MUST TAKE YOUR REPUTED TALENTS
TO SOME OTHER FIELD THERE IS NO OPENING FOR THEM HERE
I CANNOT LEAVE HERE SAID MY CLIENT FIRMLY UNTIL I HEAR FROM
GODFREYS OWN LIPS THAT HE IS UNDER NO RESTRAINT
OUR INVOLUNTARY HOST RANG THE BELL
RALPH HE SAID TELEPHONE DOWN TO THE COUNTY POLICE AND ASK THE
INSPECTOR TO SEND UP TWO CONSTABLES TELL HIM THERE ARE BURGLARS IN
THE HOUSE
ONE MOMENT SAID I YOU MUST BE AWARE MR DODD THAT COLONEL
EMSWORTH IS WITHIN HIS RIGHTS AND THAT WE HAVE NO LEGAL STATUS WITHIN
HIS HOUSE ON THE OTHER HAND HE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR ACTION IS
PROMPTED ENTIRELY BY SOLICITUDE FOR HIS SON I VENTURE TO HOPE THAT
IF I WERE ALLOWED TO HAVE FIVE MINUTES CONVERSATION WITH COLONEL
EMSWORTH I COULD CERTAINLY ALTER HIS VIEW OF THE MATTER
I AM NOT SO EASILY ALTERED SAID THE OLD SOLDIER RALPH DO WHAT I
HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT THE DEVIL ARE YOU WAITING FOR RING UP THE
POLICE
NOTHING OF THE SORT I SAID PUTTING MY BACK TO THE DOOR ANY
POLICE INTERFERENCE WOULD BRING ABOUT THE VERY CATASTROPHE WHICH YOU
DREAD I TOOK OUT MY NOTEBOOK AND SCRIBBLED ONE WORD UPON A LOOSE
SHEET THAT SAID I AS I HANDED IT TO COLONEL EMSWORTH IS WHAT
HAS BROUGHT US HERE
HE STARED AT THE WRITING WITH A FACE FROM WHICH EVERY EXPRESSION SAVE
AMAZEMENT HAD VANISHED
HOW DO YOU KNOW HE GASPED SITTING DOWN HEAVILY IN HIS CHAIR
IT IS MY BUSINESS TO KNOW THINGS THAT IS MY TRADE
HE SAT IN DEEP THOUGHT HIS GAUNT HAND TUGGING AT HIS STRAGGLING
BEARD THEN HE MADE A GESTURE OF RESIGNATION
WELL IF YOU WISH TO SEE GODFREY YOU SHALL IT IS NO DOING OF MINE
BUT YOU HAVE FORCED MY HAND RALPH TELL MR GODFREY AND MR KENT
THAT IN FIVE MINUTES WE SHALL BE WITH THEM
AT THE END OF THAT TIME WE PASSED DOWN THE GARDEN PATH AND FOUND
OURSELVES IN FRONT OF THE MYSTERY HOUSE AT THE END A SMALL BEARDED
MAN STOOD AT THE DOOR WITH A LOOK OF CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT UPON
HIS FACE
THIS IS VERY SUDDEN COLONEL EMSWORTH SAID HE THIS WILL
DISARRANGE ALL OUR PLANS
I CANT HELP IT MR KENT OUR HANDS HAVE BEEN FORCED CAN MR
GODFREY SEE US
YES HE IS WAITING INSIDE HE TURNED AND LED US INTO A LARGE
PLAINLY FURNISHED FRONT ROOM A MAN WAS STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE
FIRE AND AT THE SIGHT OF HIM MY CLIENT SPRANG FORWARD WITH
OUTSTRETCHED HAND
WHY GODFREY OLD MAN THIS IS FINE
BUT THE OTHER WAVED HIM BACK
DONT TOUCH ME JIMMIE KEEP YOUR DISTANCE YES YOU MAY WELL STARE
I DONT QUITE LOOK THE SMART LANCECORPORAL EMSWORTH OF B SQUADRON
DO I
HIS APPEARANCE WAS CERTAINLY EXTRAORDINARY ONE COULD SEE THAT HE HAD
INDEED BEEN A HANDSOME MAN WITH CLEARCUT FEATURES SUNBURNED BY AN
AFRICAN SUN BUT MOTTLED IN PATCHES OVER THIS DARKER SURFACE WERE
CURIOUS WHITISH PATCHES WHICH HAD BLEACHED HIS SKIN
THATS WHY I DONT COURT VISITORS SAID HE I DONT MIND YOU
JIMMIE BUT I COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT YOUR FRIEND I SUPPOSE THERE IS
SOME GOOD REASON FOR IT BUT YOU HAVE ME AT A DISADVANTAGE
I WANTED TO BE SURE THAT ALL WAS WELL WITH YOU GODFREY I SAW YOU
THAT NIGHT WHEN YOU LOOKED INTO MY WINDOW AND I COULD NOT LET THE
MATTER REST TILL I HAD CLEARED THINGS UP
OLD RALPH TOLD ME YOU WERE THERE AND I COULDNT HELP TAKING A PEEP
AT YOU I HOPED YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN ME AND I HAD TO RUN TO MY
BURROW WHEN I HEARD THE WINDOW GO UP
BUT WHAT IN HEAVENS NAME IS THE MATTER
WELL ITS NOT A LONG STORY TO TELL SAID HE LIGHTING A CIGARETTE
YOU REMEMBER THAT MORNING FIGHT AT BUFFELSSPRUIT OUTSIDE PRETORIA
ON THE EASTERN RAILWAY LINE YOU HEARD I WAS HIT
YES I HEARD THAT BUT I NEVER GOT PARTICULARS
THREE OF US GOT SEPARATED FROM THE OTHERS IT WAS VERY BROKEN
COUNTRY YOU MAY REMEMBER THERE WAS SIMPSONTHE FELLOW WE CALLED
BALDY SIMPSON AND ANDERSON AND I WE WERE CLEARING BROTHER BOER
BUT HE LAY LOW AND GOT THE THREE OF US THE OTHER TWO WERE KILLED I
GOT AN ELEPHANT BULLET THROUGH MY SHOULDER I STUCK ON TO MY HORSE
HOWEVER AND HE GALLOPED SEVERAL MILES BEFORE I FAINTED AND ROLLED
OFF THE SADDLE
WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF IT WAS NIGHTFALL AND I RAISED MYSELF UP
FEELING VERY WEAK AND ILL TO MY SURPRISE THERE WAS A HOUSE CLOSE
BESIDE ME A FAIRLY LARGE HOUSE WITH A BROAD STOEP AND MANY WINDOWS
IT WAS DEADLY COLD YOU REMEMBER THE KIND OF NUMB COLD WHICH USED TO
COME AT EVENING A DEADLY SICKENING SORT OF COLD VERY DIFFERENT
FROM A CRISP HEALTHY FROST WELL I WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE AND MY
ONLY HOPE SEEMED TO LIE IN REACHING THAT HOUSE I STAGGERED TO MY
FEET AND DRAGGED MYSELF ALONG HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT I DID I HAVE
A DIM MEMORY OF SLOWLY ASCENDING THE STEPS ENTERING A WIDEOPENED
DOOR PASSING INTO A LARGE ROOM WHICH CONTAINED SEVERAL BEDS AND
THROWING MYSELF DOWN WITH A GASP OF SATISFACTION UPON ONE OF THEM IT
WAS UNMADE BUT THAT TROUBLED ME NOT AT ALL I DREW THE CLOTHES OVER
MY SHIVERING BODY AND IN A MOMENT I WAS IN A DEEP SLEEP
IT WAS MORNING WHEN I WAKENED AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT INSTEAD OF
COMING OUT INTO A WORLD OF SANITY I HAD EMERGED INTO SOME
EXTRAORDINARY NIGHTMARE THE AFRICAN SUN FLOODED THROUGH THE BIG
CURTAINLESS WINDOWS AND EVERY DETAIL OF THE GREAT BARE WHITEWASHED
DORMITORY STOOD OUT HARD AND CLEAR IN FRONT OF ME WAS STANDING A
SMALL DWARFLIKE MAN WITH A HUGE BULBOUS HEAD WHO WAS JABBERING
EXCITEDLY IN DUTCH WAVING TWO HORRIBLE HANDS WHICH LOOKED TO ME LIKE
BROWN SPONGES BEHIND HIM STOOD A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO SEEMED TO BE
INTENSELY AMUSED BY THE SITUATION BUT A CHILL CAME OVER ME AS I
LOOKED AT THEM NOT ONE OF THEM WAS A NORMAL HUMAN BEING EVERY ONE
WAS TWISTED OR SWOLLEN OR DISFIGURED IN SOME STRANGE WAY THE
LAUGHTER OF THESE STRANGE MONSTROSITIES WAS A DREADFUL THING TO HEAR
IT SEEMED THAT NONE OF THEM COULD SPEAK ENGLISH BUT THE SITUATION
WANTED CLEARING UP FOR THE CREATURE WITH THE BIG HEAD WAS GROWING
FURIOUSLY ANGRY AND UTTERING WILDBEAST CRIES HE HAD LAID HIS
DEFORMED HANDS UPON ME AND WAS DRAGGING ME OUT OF BED REGARDLESS OF
THE FRESH FLOW OF BLOOD FROM MY WOUND THE LITTLE MONSTER WAS AS
STRONG AS A BULL AND I DONT KNOW WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO ME HAD
NOT AN ELDERLY MAN WHO WAS CLEARLY IN AUTHORITY BEEN ATTRACTED TO THE
ROOM BY THE HUBBUB HE SAID A FEW STERN WORDS IN DUTCH AND MY
PERSECUTOR SHRANK AWAY THEN HE TURNED UPON ME GAZING AT ME IN THE
UTMOST AMAZEMENT
HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU COME HERE HE ASKED IN AMAZEMENT WAIT A
BIT I SEE THAT YOU ARE TIRED OUT AND THAT WOUNDED SHOULDER OF YOURS
WANTS LOOKING AFTER I AM A DOCTOR AND ILL SOON HAVE YOU TIED UP
BUT MAN ALIVE YOU ARE IN FAR GREATER DANGER HERE THAN EVER YOU WERE
ON THE BATTLEFIELD YOU ARE IN THE LEPER HOSPITAL AND YOU HAVE SLEPT
IN A LEPERS BED
NEED I TELL YOU MORE JIMMIE IT SEEMS THAT IN VIEW OF THE
APPROACHING BATTLE ALL THESE POOR CREATURES HAD BEEN EVACUATED THE
DAY BEFORE THEN AS THE BRITISH ADVANCED THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT BACK
BY THIS THEIR MEDICAL SUPERINTENDENT WHO ASSURED ME THAT THOUGH HE
BELIEVED HE WAS IMMUNE TO THE DISEASE HE WOULD NONE THE LESS NEVER
HAVE DARED TO DO WHAT I HAD DONE HE PUT ME IN A PRIVATE ROOM
TREATED ME KINDLY AND WITHIN A WEEK OR SO I WAS REMOVED TO THE
GENERAL HOSPITAL AT PRETORIA
SO THERE YOU HAVE MY TRAGEDY I HOPED AGAINST HOPE BUT IT WAS NOT
UNTIL I HAD REACHED HOME THAT THE TERRIBLE SIGNS WHICH YOU SEE UPON
MY FACE TOLD ME THAT I HAD NOT ESCAPED WHAT WAS I TO DO I WAS IN
THIS LONELY HOUSE WE HAD TWO SERVANTS WHOM WE COULD UTTERLY TRUST
THERE WAS A HOUSE WHERE I COULD LIVE UNDER PLEDGE OF SECRECY MR
KENT WHO IS A SURGEON WAS PREPARED TO STAY WITH ME IT SEEMED
SIMPLE ENOUGH ON THOSE LINES THE ALTERNATIVE WAS A DREADFUL
ONESEGREGATION FOR LIFE AMONG STRANGERS WITH NEVER A HOPE OF
RELEASE BUT ABSOLUTE SECRECY WAS NECESSARY OR EVEN IN THIS QUIET
COUNTRYSIDE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN OUTCRY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
DRAGGED TO MY HORRIBLE DOOM EVEN YOU JIMMIEEVEN YOU HAD TO BE
KEPT IN THE DARK WHY MY FATHER HAS RELENTED I CANNOT IMAGINE
COLONEL EMSWORTH POINTED TO ME
THIS IS THE GENTLEMAN WHO FORCED MY HAND HE UNFOLDED THE SCRAP OF
PAPER ON WHICH I HAD WRITTEN THE WORD LEPROSY IT SEEMED TO ME
THAT IF HE KNEW SO MUCH AS THAT IT WAS SAFER THAT HE SHOULD KNOW
ALL
AND SO IT WAS SAID I WHO KNOWS BUT GOOD MAY COME OF IT I
UNDERSTAND THAT ONLY MR KENT HAS SEEN THE PATIENT MAY I ASK SIR
IF YOU ARE AN AUTHORITY ON SUCH COMPLAINTS WHICH ARE I UNDERSTAND
TROPICAL OR SEMITROPICAL IN THEIR NATURE
I HAVE THE ORDINARY KNOWLEDGE OF THE EDUCATED MEDICAL MAN HE
OBSERVED WITH SOME STIFFNESS
I HAVE NO DOUBT SIR THAT YOU ARE FULLY COMPETENT BUT I AM SURE
THAT YOU WILL AGREE THAT IN SUCH A CASE A SECOND OPINION IS VALUABLE
YOU HAVE AVOIDED THIS I UNDERSTAND FOR FEAR THAT PRESSURE SHOULD BE
PUT UPON YOU TO SEGREGATE THE PATIENT
THAT IS SO SAID COLONEL EMSWORTH
I FORESAW THIS SITUATION I EXPLAINED AND I HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME
A FRIEND WHOSE DISCRETION MAY ABSOLUTELY BE TRUSTED I WAS ABLE ONCE
TO DO HIM A PROFESSIONAL SERVICE AND HE IS READY TO ADVISE AS A
FRIEND RATHER THAN AS A SPECIALIST HIS NAME IS SIR JAMES SAUNDERS
THE PROSPECT OF AN INTERVIEW WITH LORD ROBERTS WOULD NOT HAVE EXCITED
GREATER WONDER AND PLEASURE IN A RAW SUBALTERN THAN WAS NOW REFLECTED
UPON THE FACE OF MR KENT
I SHALL INDEED BE PROUD HE MURMURED
THEN I WILL ASK SIR JAMES TO STEP THIS WAY HE IS AT PRESENT IN THE
CARRIAGE OUTSIDE THE DOOR MEANWHILE COLONEL EMSWORTH WE MAY
PERHAPS ASSEMBLE IN YOUR STUDY WHERE I COULD GIVE THE NECESSARY
EXPLANATIONS
AND HERE IT IS THAT I MISS MY WATSON BY CUNNING QUESTIONS AND
EJACULATIONS OF WONDER HE COULD ELEVATE MY SIMPLE ART WHICH IS BUT
SYSTEMATIZED COMMON SENSE INTO A PRODIGY WHEN I TELL MY OWN STORY I
HAVE NO SUCH AID AND YET I WILL GIVE MY PROCESS OF THOUGHT EVEN AS I
GAVE IT TO MY SMALL AUDIENCE WHICH INCLUDED GODFREYS MOTHER IN THE
STUDY OF COLONEL EMSWORTH
THAT PROCESS SAID I STARTS UPON THE SUPPOSITION THAT WHEN YOU
HAVE ELIMINATED ALL WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE THEN WHATEVER REMAINS
HOWEVER IMPROBABLE MUST BE THE TRUTH IT MAY WELL BE THAT SEVERAL
EXPLANATIONS REMAIN IN WHICH CASE ONE TRIES TEST AFTER TEST UNTIL
ONE OR OTHER OF THEM HAS A CONVINCING AMOUNT OF SUPPORT WE WILL NOW
APPLY THIS PRINCIPLE TO THE CASE IN POINT AS IT WAS FIRST PRESENTED
TO ME THERE WERE THREE POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS OF THE SECLUSION OR
INCARCERATION OF THIS GENTLEMAN IN AN OUTHOUSE OF HIS FATHERS
MANSION THERE WAS THE EXPLANATION THAT HE WAS IN HIDING FOR A CRIME
OR THAT HE WAS MAD AND THAT THEY WISHED TO AVOID AN ASYLUM OR THAT
HE HAD SOME DISEASE WHICH CAUSED HIS SEGREGATION I COULD THINK OF NO
OTHER ADEQUATE SOLUTIONS THESE THEN HAD TO BE SIFTED AND BALANCED
AGAINST EACH OTHER
THE CRIMINAL SOLUTION WOULD NOT BEAR INSPECTION NO UNSOLVED CRIME
HAD BEEN REPORTED FROM THAT DISTRICT I WAS SURE OF THAT IF IT WERE
SOME CRIME NOT YET DISCOVERED THEN CLEARLY IT WOULD BE TO THE
INTEREST OF THE FAMILY TO GET RID OF THE DELINQUENT AND SEND HIM
ABROAD RATHER THAN KEEP HIM CONCEALED AT HOME I COULD SEE NO
EXPLANATION FOR SUCH A LINE OF CONDUCT
INSANITY WAS MORE PLAUSIBLE THE PRESENCE OF THE SECOND PERSON IN
THE OUTHOUSE SUGGESTED A KEEPER THE FACT THAT HE LOCKED THE DOOR
WHEN HE CAME OUT STRENGTHENED THE SUPPOSITION AND GAVE THE IDEA OF
CONSTRAINT ON THE OTHER HAND THIS CONSTRAINT COULD NOT BE SEVERE OR
THE YOUNG MAN COULD NOT HAVE GOT LOOSE AND COME DOWN TO HAVE A LOOK
AT HIS FRIEND YOU WILL REMEMBER MR DODD THAT I FELT ROUND FOR
POINTS ASKING YOU FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE PAPER WHICH MR KENT WAS
READING HAD IT BEEN THE LANCET OR THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL IT
WOULD HAVE HELPED ME IT IS NOT ILLEGAL HOWEVER TO KEEP A LUNATIC
UPON PRIVATE PREMISES SO LONG AS THERE IS A QUALIFIED PERSON IN
ATTENDANCE AND THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN DULY NOTIFIED WHY
THEN ALL THIS DESPERATE DESIRE FOR SECRECY ONCE AGAIN I COULD NOT
GET THE THEORY TO FIT THE FACTS
THERE REMAINED THE THIRD POSSIBILITY INTO WHICH RARE AND UNLIKELY
AS IT WAS EVERYTHING SEEMED TO FIT LEPROSY IS NOT UNCOMMON IN SOUTH
AFRICA BY SOME EXTRAORDINARY CHANCE THIS YOUTH MIGHT HAVE CONTRACTED
IT HIS PEOPLE WOULD BE PLACED IN A VERY DREADFUL POSITION SINCE
THEY WOULD DESIRE TO SAVE HIM FROM SEGREGATION GREAT SECRECY WOULD
BE NEEDED TO PREVENT RUMOURS FROM GETTING ABOUT AND SUBSEQUENT
INTERFERENCE BY THE AUTHORITIES A DEVOTED MEDICAL MAN IF
SUFFICIENTLY PAID WOULD EASILY BE FOUND TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE
SUFFERER THERE WOULD BE NO REASON WHY THE LATTER SHOULD NOT BE
ALLOWED FREEDOM AFTER DARK BLEACHING OF THE SKIN IS A COMMON RESULT
OF THE DISEASE THE CASE WAS A STRONG ONESO STRONG THAT I
DETERMINED TO ACT AS IF IT WERE ACTUALLY PROVED WHEN ON ARRIVING
HERE I NOTICED THAT RALPH WHO CARRIES OUT THE MEALS HAD GLOVES
WHICH ARE IMPREGNATED WITH DISINFECTANTS MY LAST DOUBTS WERE
REMOVED A SINGLE WORD SHOWED YOU SIR THAT YOUR SECRET WAS
DISCOVERED AND IF I WROTE RATHER THAN SAID IT IT WAS TO PROVE TO
YOU THAT MY DISCRETION WAS TO BE TRUSTED
I WAS FINISHING THIS LITTLE ANALYSIS OF THE CASE WHEN THE DOOR WAS
OPENED AND THE AUSTERE FIGURE OF THE GREAT DERMATOLOGIST WAS USHERED
IN BUT FOR ONCE HIS SPHINXLIKE FEATURES HAD RELAXED AND THERE WAS A
WARM HUMANITY IN HIS EYES HE STRODE UP TO COLONEL EMSWORTH AND SHOOK
HIM BY THE HAND
IT IS OFTEN MY LOT TO BRING ILLTIDINGS AND SELDOM GOOD SAID HE
THIS OCCASION IS THE MORE WELCOME IT IS NOT LEPROSY
WHAT
A WELLMARKED CASE OF PSEUDOLEPROSY OR ICHTHYOSIS A SCALELIKE
AFFECTION OF THE SKIN UNSIGHTLY OBSTINATE BUT POSSIBLY CURABLE
AND CERTAINLY NONINFECTIVE YES MR HOLMES THE COINCIDENCE IS A
REMARKABLE ONE BUT IS IT COINCIDENCE ARE THERE NOT SUBTLE FORCES AT
WORK OF WHICH WE KNOW LITTLE ARE WE ASSURED THAT THE APPREHENSION
FROM WHICH THIS YOUNG MAN HAS NO DOUBT SUFFERED TERRIBLY SINCE HIS
EXPOSURE TO ITS CONTAGION MAY NOT PRODUCE A PHYSICAL EFFECT WHICH
SIMULATES THAT WHICH IT FEARS AT ANY RATE I PLEDGE MY PROFESSIONAL
REPUTATION BUT THE LADY HAS FAINTED I THINK THAT MR KENT HAD
BETTER BE WITH HER UNTIL SHE RECOVERS FROM THIS JOYOUS SHOCK
THE ADVENTURE OF THE MAZARIN STONE
IT WAS PLEASANT TO DR WATSON TO FIND HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE UNTIDY
ROOM OF THE FIRST FLOOR IN BAKER STREET WHICH HAD BEEN THE
STARTINGPOINT OF SO MANY REMARKABLE ADVENTURES HE LOOKED ROUND HIM
AT THE SCIENTIFIC CHARTS UPON THE WALL THE ACIDCHARRED BENCH OF
CHEMICALS THE VIOLINCASE LEANING IN THE CORNER THE COALSCUTTLE
WHICH CONTAINED OF OLD THE PIPES AND TOBACCO FINALLY HIS EYES CAME
ROUND TO THE FRESH AND SMILING FACE OF BILLY THE YOUNG BUT VERY WISE
AND TACTFUL PAGE WHO HAD HELPED A LITTLE TO FILL UP THE GAP OF
LONELINESS AND ISOLATION WHICH SURROUNDED THE SATURNINE FIGURE OF THE
GREAT DETECTIVE
IT ALL SEEMS VERY UNCHANGED BILLY YOU DONT CHANGE EITHER I HOPE
THE SAME CAN BE SAID OF HIM
BILLY GLANCED WITH SOME SOLICITUDE AT THE CLOSED DOOR OF THE BEDROOM
I THINK HES IN BED AND ASLEEP HE SAID
IT WAS SEVEN IN THE EVENING OF A LOVELY SUMMERS DAY BUT DR WATSON
WAS SUFFICIENTLY FAMILIAR WITH THE IRREGULARITY OF HIS OLD FRIENDS
HOURS TO FEEL NO SURPRISE AT THE IDEA
THAT MEANS A CASE I SUPPOSE
YES SIR HE IS VERY HARD AT IT JUST NOW IM FRIGHTENED FOR HIS
HEALTH HE GETS PALER AND THINNER AND HE EATS NOTHING WHEN WILL
YOU BE PLEASED TO DINE MR HOLMES MRS HUDSON ASKED
SEVENTHIRTY THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW SAID HE YOU KNOW HIS WAY
WHEN HE IS KEEN ON A CASE
YES BILLY I KNOW
HES FOLLOWING SOMEONE YESTERDAY HE WAS OUT AS A WORKMAN LOOKING
FOR A JOB TODAY HE WAS AN OLD WOMAN FAIRLY TOOK ME IN HE DID AND
I OUGHT TO KNOW HIS WAYS BY NOW BILLY POINTED WITH A GRIN TO A VERY
BAGGY PARASOL WHICH LEANED AGAINST THE SOFA THATS PART OF THE OLD
WOMANS OUTFIT HE SAID
BUT WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT BILLY
BILLY SANK HIS VOICE AS ONE WHO DISCUSSES GREAT SECRETS OF STATE I
DONT MIND TELLING YOU SIR BUT IT SHOULD GO NO FARTHER ITS THIS
CASE OF THE CROWN DIAMOND
WHATTHE HUNDREDTHOUSANDPOUND BURGLARY
YES SIR THEY MUST GET IT BACK SIR WHY WE HAD THE PRIME MINISTER
AND THE HOME SECRETARY BOTH SITTING ON THAT VERY SOFA MR HOLMES WAS
VERY NICE TO THEM HE SOON PUT THEM AT THEIR EASE AND PROMISED HE
WOULD DO ALL HE COULD THEN THERE IS LORD CANTLEMERE
AH
YES SIR YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS HES A STIFF UN SIR IF I MAY
SAY SO I CAN GET ALONG WITH THE PRIME MINISTER AND IVE NOTHING
AGAINST THE HOME SECRETARY WHO SEEMED A CIVIL OBLIGING SORT OF MAN
BUT I CANT STAND HIS LORDSHIP NEITHER CAN MR HOLMES SIR YOU SEE
HE DONT BELIEVE IN MR HOLMES AND HE WAS AGAINST EMPLOYING HIM HED
RATHER HE FAILED
AND MR HOLMES KNOWS IT
MR HOLMES ALWAYS KNOWS WHATEVER THERE IS TO KNOW
WELL WELL HOPE HE WONT FAIL AND THAT LORD CANTLEMERE WILL BE
CONFOUNDED BUT I SAY BILLY WHAT IS THAT CURTAIN FOR ACROSS THE
WINDOW
MR HOLMES HAD IT PUT UP THERE THREE DAYS AGO WEVE GOT SOMETHING
FUNNY BEHIND IT
BILLY ADVANCED AND DREW AWAY THE DRAPERY WHICH SCREENED THE ALCOVE OF
THE BOW WINDOW
DR WATSON COULD NOT RESTRAIN A CRY OF AMAZEMENT THERE WAS A
FACSIMILE OF HIS OLD FRIEND DRESSINGGOWN AND ALL THE FACE TURNED
THREEQUARTERS TOWARDS THE WINDOW AND DOWNWARD AS THOUGH READING AN
INVISIBLE BOOK WHILE THE BODY WAS SUNK DEEP IN AN ARMCHAIR BILLY
DETACHED THE HEAD AND HELD IT IN THE AIR
WE PUT IT AT DIFFERENT ANGLES SO THAT IT MAY SEEM MORE LIFELIKE I
WOULDNT DARE TOUCH IT IF THE BLIND WERE NOT DOWN BUT WHEN ITS UP
YOU CAN SEE THIS FROM ACROSS THE WAY
WE USED SOMETHING OF THE SORT ONCE BEFORE
BEFORE MY TIME SAID BILLY HE DREW THE WINDOW CURTAINS APART AND
LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET THERE ARE FOLK WHO WATCH US FROM OVER
YONDER I CAN SEE A FELLOW NOW AT THE WINDOW HAVE A LOOK FOR
YOURSELF
WATSON HAD TAKEN A STEP FORWARD WHEN THE BEDROOM DOOR OPENED AND THE
LONG THIN FORM OF HOLMES EMERGED HIS FACE PALE AND DRAWN BUT HIS
STEP AND BEARING AS ACTIVE AS EVER WITH A SINGLE SPRING HE WAS AT
THE WINDOW AND HAD DRAWN THE BLIND ONCE MORE
THAT WILL DO BILLY SAID HE YOU WERE IN DANGER OF YOUR LIFE
THEN MY BOY AND I CANT DO WITHOUT YOU JUST YET WELL WATSON IT
IS GOOD TO SEE YOU IN YOUR OLD QUARTERS ONCE AGAIN YOU COME AT A
CRITICAL MOMENT
SO I GATHER
YOU CAN GO BILLY THAT BOY IS A PROBLEM WATSON HOW FAR AM I
JUSTIFIED IN ALLOWING HIM TO BE IN DANGER
DANGER OF WHAT HOLMES
OF SUDDEN DEATH IM EXPECTING SOMETHING THIS EVENING
EXPECTING WHAT
TO BE MURDERED WATSON
NO NO YOU ARE JOKING HOLMES
EVEN MY LIMITED SENSE OF HUMOUR COULD EVOLVE A BETTER JOKE THAN
THAT BUT WE MAY BE COMFORTABLE IN THE MEANTIME MAY WE NOT IS
ALCOHOL PERMITTED THE GASOGENE AND CIGARS ARE IN THE OLD PLACE LET
ME SEE YOU ONCE MORE IN THE CUSTOMARY ARMCHAIR YOU HAVE NOT I HOPE
LEARNED TO DESPISE MY PIPE AND MY LAMENTABLE TOBACCO IT HAS TO TAKE
THE PLACE OF FOOD THESE DAYS
BUT WHY NOT EAT
BECAUSE THE FACULTIES BECOME REFINED WHEN YOU STARVE THEM WHY
SURELY AS A DOCTOR MY DEAR WATSON YOU MUST ADMIT THAT WHAT YOUR
DIGESTION GAINS IN THE WAY OF BLOOD SUPPLY IS SO MUCH LOST TO THE
BRAIN I AM A BRAIN WATSON THE REST OF ME IS A MERE APPENDIX
THEREFORE IT IS THE BRAIN I MUST CONSIDER
BUT THIS DANGER HOLMES
AH YES IN CASE IT SHOULD COME OFF IT WOULD PERHAPS BE AS WELL
THAT YOU SHOULD BURDEN YOUR MEMORY WITH THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE
MURDERER YOU CAN GIVE IT TO SCOTLAND YARD WITH MY LOVE AND A

WATSONS HONEST FACE WAS TWITCHING WITH ANXIETY HE KNEW ONLY TOO
WELL THE IMMENSE RISKS TAKEN BY HOLMES AND WAS WELL AWARE THAT WHAT
HE SAID WAS MORE LIKELY TO BE UNDERSTATEMENT THAN EXAGGERATION
WATSON WAS ALWAYS THE MAN OF ACTION AND HE ROSE TO THE OCCASION
COUNT ME IN HOLMES I HAVE NOTHING TO DO FOR A DAY OR TWO

OTHER VICES YOU BEAR EVERY SIGN OF THE BUSY MEDICAL MAN WITH CALLS

THAT HE FEELS MY TOE VERY CLOSE BEHIND HIS HEEL
SEND FOR THE POLICE
I PROBABLY SHALL BUT NOT JUST YET WOULD YOU GLANCE CAREFULLY OUT
OF THE WINDOW WATSON AND SEE IF ANYONE IS HANGING ABOUT IN THE
STREET

BEDROOM THIS SECOND EXIT IS EXCEEDINGLY USEFUL I RATHER WANT TO SEE
MY SHARK WITHOUT HIS SEEING ME AND I HAVE AS YOU WILL REMEMBER MY
OWN WAY OF DOING IT
IT WAS THEREFORE AN EMPTY ROOM INTO WHICH BILLY A MINUTE LATER
USHERED COUNT SYLVIUS THE FAMOUS GAMESHOT SPORTSMAN AND
MANABOUTTOWN WAS A BIG SWARTHY FELLOW WITH A FORMIDABLE DARK
MOUSTACHE SHADING A CRUEL THINLIPPED MOUTH AND SURMOUNTED BY A
LONG CURVED NOSE LIKE THE BEAK OF AN EAGLE HE WAS WELL DRESSED BUT
HIS BRILLIANT NECKTIE SHINING PIN AND GLITTERING RINGS WERE
FLAMBOYANT IN THEIR EFFECT AS THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM HE LOOKED
ROUND HIM WITH FIERCE STARTLED EYES LIKE ONE WHO SUSPECTS A TRAP AT
EVERY TURN THEN HE GAVE A VIOLENT START AS HE SAW THE IMPASSIVE HEAD
AND THE COLLAR OF THE DRESSINGGOWN WHICH PROJECTED ABOVE THE
ARMCHAIR IN THE WINDOW AT FIRST HIS EXPRESSION WAS ONE OF PURE
AMAZEMENT THEN THE LIGHT OF A HORRIBLE HOPE GLEAMED IN HIS DARK
MURDEROUS EYES HE TOOK ONE MORE GLANCE ROUND TO SEE THAT THERE WERE
NO WITNESSES AND THEN ON TIPTOE HIS THICK STICK HALF RAISED HE
APPROACHED THE SILENT FIGURE HE WAS CROUCHING FOR HIS FINAL SPRING
AND BLOW WHEN A COOL SARDONIC VOICE GREETED HIM FROM THE OPEN
BEDROOM DOOR
DONT BREAK IT COUNT DONT BREAK IT
THE ASSASSIN STAGGERED BACK AMAZEMENT IN HIS CONVULSED FACE FOR AN
INSTANT HE HALF RAISED HIS LOADED CANE ONCE MORE AS IF HE WOULD TURN
HIS VIOLENCE FROM THE EFFIGY TO THE ORIGINAL BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING
IN THAT STEADY GRAY EYE AND MOCKING SMILE WHICH CAUSED HIS HAND TO
SINK TO HIS SIDE
ITS A PRETTY LITTLE THING SAID HOLMES ADVANCING TOWARDS THE
IMAGE TAVERNIER THE FRENCH MODELLER MADE IT HE IS AS GOOD AT

BILLY HAD APPEARED IN ANSWER TO A RING
I THINK COUNT THAT IT WOULD BE AS WELL TO HAVE YOUR FRIEND SAM AT

TOGETHER
THE COUNT HAD RISEN FROM HIS CHAIR AND HIS HAND WAS BEHIND HIS BACK
HOLMES HELD SOMETHING HALF PROTRUDING FROM THE POCKET OF HIS
DRESSINGGOWN
YOU WONT DIE IN YOUR BED HOLMES
I HAVE OFTEN HAD THE SAME IDEA DOES IT MATTER VERY MUCH AFTER ALL
COUNT YOUR OWN EXIT IS MORE LIKELY TO BE PERPENDICULAR THAN
HORIZONTAL BUT THESE ANTICIPATIONS OF THE FUTURE ARE MORBID WHY NOT
GIVE OURSELVES UP TO THE UNRESTRAINED ENJOYMENT OF THE PRESENT
A SUDDEN WILDBEAST LIGHT SPRANG UP IN THE DARK MENACING EYES OF THE
MASTER CRIMINAL HOLMESS FIGURE SEEMED TO GROW TALLER AS HE GREW

THANK YOU
WITH A SINGLE SPRING HOLMES HAD LEAPED FROM THE DUMMYS CHAIR AND HAD
GRASPED THE PRECIOUS JEWEL HE HELD IT NOW IN ONE HAND WHILE HIS
OTHER POINTED A REVOLVER AT THE COUNTS HEAD THE TWO VILLAINS
STAGGERED BACK IN UTTER AMAZEMENT BEFORE THEY HAD RECOVERED HOLMES
HAD PRESSED THE ELECTRIC BELL
NO VIOLENCE GENTLEMENNO VIOLENCE I BEG OF YOU CONSIDER THE
FURNITURE IT MUST BE VERY CLEAR TO YOU THAT YOUR POSITION IS AN
IMPOSSIBLE ONE THE POLICE ARE WAITING BELOW
THE COUNTS BEWILDERMENT OVERMASTERED HIS RAGE AND FEAR
BUT HOW THE DEUCE HE GASPED
YOUR SURPRISE IS VERY NATURAL YOU ARE NOT AWARE THAT A SECOND DOOR
FROM MY BEDROOM LEADS BEHIND THAT CURTAIN I FANCIED THAT YOU MUST
HAVE HEARD ME WHEN I DISPLACED THE FIGURE BUT LUCK WAS ON MY SIDE
IT GAVE ME A CHANCE OF LISTENING TO YOUR RACY CONVERSATION WHICH
WOULD HAVE BEEN PAINFULLY CONSTRAINED HAD YOU BEEN AWARE OF MY
PRESENCE
THE COUNT GAVE A GESTURE OF RESIGNATION
WE GIVE YOU BEST HOLMES I BELIEVE YOU ARE THE DEVIL HIMSELF
NOT FAR FROM HIM AT ANY RATE HOLMES ANSWERED WITH A POLITE SMILE
SAM MERTONS SLOW INTELLECT HAD ONLY GRADUALLY APPRECIATED THE
SITUATION NOW AS THE SOUND OF HEAVY STEPS CAME FROM THE STAIRS
OUTSIDE HE BROKE SILENCE AT LAST
A FAIR COP SAID HE BUT I SAY WHAT ABOUT THAT BLOOMIN FIDDLE
I HEAR IT YET
TUT TUT HOLMES ANSWERED YOU ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT LET IT PLAY
THESE MODERN GRAMOPHONES ARE A REMARKABLE INVENTION
THERE WAS AN INRUSH OF POLICE THE HANDCUFFS CLICKED AND THE
CRIMINALS WERE LED TO THE WAITING CAB WATSON LINGERED WITH HOLMES
CONGRATULATING HIM UPON THIS FRESH LEAF ADDED TO HIS LAURELS ONCE
MORE THEIR CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE IMPERTURBABLE BILLY
WITH HIS CARDTRAY
LORD CANTLEMERE SIR
SHOW HIM UP BILLY THIS IS THE EMINENT PEER WHO REPRESENTS THE VERY
HIGHEST INTERESTS SAID HOLMES HE IS AN EXCELLENT AND LOYAL
PERSON BUT RATHER OF THE OLD REGIME SHALL WE MAKE HIM UNBEND DARE
WE VENTURE UPON A SLIGHT LIBERTY HE KNOWS WE MAY CONJECTURE
NOTHING OF WHAT HAS OCCURRED
THE DOOR OPENED TO ADMIT A THIN AUSTERE FIGURE WITH A HATCHET FACE
AND DROOPING MIDVICTORIAN WHISKERS OF A GLOSSY BLACKNESS WHICH
HARDLY CORRESPONDED WITH THE ROUNDED SHOULDERS AND FEEBLE GAIT
HOLMES ADVANCED AFFABLY AND SHOOK AN UNRESPONSIVE HAND
HOW DO YOU DO LORD CANTLEMERE IT IS CHILLY FOR THE TIME OF YEAR
BUT RATHER WARM INDOORS MAY I TAKE YOUR OVERCOAT
NO I THANK YOU I WILL NOT TAKE IT OFF
HOLMES LAID HIS HAND INSISTENTLY UPON THE SLEEVE
PRAY ALLOW ME MY FRIEND DR WATSON WOULD ASSURE YOU THAT THESE
CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE ARE MOST INSIDIOUS
HIS LORDSHIP SHOOK HIMSELF FREE WITH SOME IMPATIENCE
I AM QUITE COMFORTABLE SIR I HAVE NO NEED TO STAY I HAVE SIMPLY
LOOKED IN TO KNOW HOW YOUR SELFAPPOINTED TASK WAS PROGRESSING
IT IS DIFFICULTVERY DIFFICULT
I FEARED THAT YOU WOULD FIND IT SO
THERE WAS A DISTINCT SNEER IN THE OLD COURTIERS WORDS AND MANNER
EVERY MAN FINDS HIS LIMITATIONS MR HOLMES BUT AT LEAST IT CURES
US OF THE WEAKNESS OF SELFSATISFACTION
YES SIR I HAVE BEEN MUCH PERPLEXED
NO DOUBT
ESPECIALLY UPON ONE POINT POSSIBLY YOU COULD HELP ME UPON IT
YOU APPLY FOR MY ADVICE RATHER LATE IN THE DAY I THOUGHT THAT YOU
HAD YOUR OWN ALLSUFFICIENT METHODS STILL I AM READY TO HELP YOU
YOU SEE LORD CANTLEMERE WE CAN NO DOUBT FRAME A CASE AGAINST THE
ACTUAL THIEVES
WHEN YOU HAVE CAUGHT THEM
EXACTLY BUT THE QUESTION ISHOW SHALL WE PROCEED AGAINST THE
RECEIVER
IS THIS NOT RATHER PREMATURE
IT IS AS WELL TO HAVE OUR PLANS READY NOW WHAT WOULD YOU REGARD AS
FINAL EVIDENCE AGAINST THE RECEIVER
THE ACTUAL POSSESSION OF THE STONE
YOU WOULD ARREST HIM UPON THAT
MOST UNDOUBTEDLY
HOLMES SELDOM LAUGHED BUT HE GOT AS NEAR IT AS HIS OLD FRIEND WATSON
COULD REMEMBER
IN THAT CASE MY DEAR SIR I SHALL BE UNDER THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF
ADVISING YOUR ARREST
LORD CANTLEMERE WAS VERY ANGRY SOME OF THE ANCIENT FIRES FLICKERED
UP INTO HIS SALLOW CHEEKS
YOU TAKE A GREAT LIBERTY MR HOLMES IN FIFTY YEARS OF OFFICIAL
LIFE I CANNOT RECALL SUCH A CASE I AM A BUSY MAN SIR ENGAGED UPON
IMPORTANT AFFAIRS AND I HAVE NO TIME OR TASTE FOR FOOLISH JOKES I
MAY TELL YOU FRANKLY SIR THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN A BELIEVER IN YOUR
POWERS AND THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OF THE OPINION THAT THE MATTER
WAS FAR SAFER IN THE HANDS OF THE REGULAR POLICE FORCE YOUR CONDUCT
CONFIRMS ALL MY CONCLUSIONS I HAVE THE HONOUR SIR TO WISH YOU
GOODEVENING
HOLMES HAD SWIFTLY CHANGED HIS POSITION AND WAS BETWEEN THE PEER AND
THE DOOR
ONE MOMENT SIR SAID HE TO ACTUALLY GO OFF WITH THE MAZARIN
STONE WOULD BE A MORE SERIOUS OFFENCE THAN TO BE FOUND IN TEMPORARY
POSSESSION OF IT
SIR THIS IS INTOLERABLE LET ME PASS
PUT YOUR HAND IN THE RIGHTHAND POCKET OF YOUR OVERCOAT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SIR
COMECOME DO WHAT I ASK
AN INSTANT LATER THE AMAZED PEER WAS STANDING BLINKING AND
STAMMERING WITH THE GREAT YELLOW STONE ON HIS SHAKING PALM
WHAT WHAT HOW IS THIS MR HOLMES
TOO BAD LORD CANTLEMERE TOO BAD CRIED HOLMES MY OLD FRIEND
HERE WILL TELL YOU THAT I HAVE AN IMPISH HABIT OF PRACTICAL JOKING
ALSO THAT I CAN NEVER RESIST A DRAMATIC SITUATION I TOOK THE
LIBERTYTHE VERY GREAT LIBERTY I ADMITOF PUTTING THE STONE INTO
YOUR POCKET AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR INTERVIEW
THE OLD PEER STARED FROM THE STONE TO THE SMILING FACE BEFORE HIM
SIR I AM BEWILDERED BUTYESIT IS INDEED THE MAZARIN STONE WE
ARE GREATLY YOUR DEBTORS MR HOLMES YOUR SENSE OF HUMOUR MAY AS
YOU ADMIT BE SOMEWHAT PERVERTED AND ITS EXHIBITION REMARKABLY
UNTIMELY BUT AT LEAST I WITHDRAW ANY REFLECTION I HAVE MADE UPON
YOUR AMAZING PROFESSIONAL POWERS BUT HOW
THE CASE IS BUT HALF FINISHED THE DETAILS CAN WAIT NO DOUBT LORD
CANTLEMERE YOUR PLEASURE IN TELLING OF THIS SUCCESSFUL RESULT IN THE
EXALTED CIRCLE TO WHICH YOU RETURN WILL BE SOME SMALL ATONEMENT FOR
MY PRACTICAL JOKE BILLY YOU WILL SHOW HIS LORDSHIP OUT AND TELL
MRS HUDSON THAT I SHOULD BE GLAD IF SHE WOULD SEND UP DINNER FOR TWO
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

OPENED QUITE SO ABRUPTLY OR SO DRAMATICALLY AS THAT WHICH I
ASSOCIATE WITH THE THREE GABLES I HAD NOT SEEN HOLMES FOR SOME DAYS
AND HAD NO IDEA OF THE NEW CHANNEL INTO WHICH HIS ACTIVITIES HAD BEEN
DIRECTED HE WAS IN A CHATTY MOOD THAT MORNING HOWEVER AND HAD JUST
SETTLED ME INTO THE WELLWORN LOW ARMCHAIR ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIRE
WHILE HE HAD CURLED DOWN WITH HIS PIPE IN HIS MOUTH UPON THE OPPOSITE
CHAIR WHEN OUR VISITOR ARRIVED IF I HAD SAID THAT A MAD BULL HAD
ARRIVED IT WOULD GIVE A CLEARER IMPRESSION OF WHAT OCCURRED
THE DOOR HAD FLOWN OPEN AND A HUGE NEGRO HAD BURST INTO THE ROOM HE
WOULD HAVE BEEN A COMIC FIGURE IF HE HAD NOT BEEN TERRIFIC FOR HE
WAS DRESSED IN A VERY LOUD GRAY CHECK SUIT WITH A FLOWING
SALMONCOLOURED TIE HIS BROAD FACE AND FLATTENED NOSE WERE THRUST
FORWARD AS HIS SULLEN DARK EYES WITH A SMOULDERING GLEAM OF MALICE

WHEN I HAVE TIME HIS IMMEDIATE PRINCIPAL BARNEY IS A MORE ASTUTE
PERSON THEY SPECIALIZE IN ASSAULTS INTIMIDATION AND THE LIKE WHAT
I WANT TO KNOW IS WHO IS AT THE BACK OF THEM ON THIS PARTICULAR
OCCASION
BUT WHY DO THEY WANT TO INTIMIDATE YOU

BUT WHAT IS IT
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU WHEN WE HAD THIS COMIC INTERLUDE HERE IS
MRS MABERLEYS NOTE IF YOU CARE TO COME WITH ME WE WILL WIRE HER
AND GO OUT AT ONCE
DEAR MR SHERLOCK HOLMES I READ
I HAVE HAD A SUCCESSION OF STRANGE INCIDENTS OCCUR TO ME IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS HOUSE AND I SHOULD MUCH VALUE YOUR ADVICE YOU
WOULD FIND ME AT HOME ANY TIME TOMORROW THE HOUSE IS WITHIN A SHORT
WALK OF THE WEALD STATION I BELIEVE THAT MY LATE HUSBAND MORTIMER
MABERLEY WAS ONE OF YOUR EARLY CLIENTS
YOURS FAITHFULLY
MARY MABERLEY
THE ADDRESS WAS THE THREE GABLES HARROW WEALD
SO THATS THAT SAID HOLMES AND NOW IF YOU CAN SPARE THE TIME
WATSON WE WILL GET UPON OUR WAY
A SHORT RAILWAY JOURNEY AND A SHORTER DRIVE BROUGHT US TO THE
HOUSE A BRICK AND TIMBER VILLA STANDING IN ITS OWN ACRE OF
UNDEVELOPED GRASSLAND THREE SMALL PROJECTIONS ABOVE THE UPPER
WINDOWS MADE A FEEBLE ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY ITS NAME BEHIND WAS A GROVE
OF MELANCHOLY HALFGROWN PINES AND THE WHOLE ASPECT OF THE PLACE
WAS POOR AND DEPRESSING NONE THE LESS WE FOUND THE HOUSE TO BE WELL
FURNISHED AND THE LADY WHO RECEIVED US WAS A MOST ENGAGING ELDERLY
PERSON WHO BORE EVERY MARK OF REFINEMENT AND CULTURE
I REMEMBER YOUR HUSBAND WELL MADAM SAID HOLMES THOUGH IT IS
SOME YEARS SINCE HE USED MY SERVICES IN SOME TRIFLING MATTER
PROBABLY YOU WOULD BE MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE NAME OF MY SON
DOUGLAS
HOLMES LOOKED AT HER WITH GREAT INTEREST
DEAR ME ARE YOU THE MOTHER OF DOUGLAS MABERLEY I KNEW HIM
SLIGHTLY BUT OF COURSE ALL LONDON KNEW HIM WHAT A MAGNIFICENT
CREATURE HE WAS WHERE IS HE NOW
DEAD MR HOLMES DEAD HE WAS ATTACHE AT ROME AND HE DIED THERE OF
PNEUMONIA LAST MONTH
I AM SORRY ONE COULD NOT CONNECT DEATH WITH SUCH A MAN I HAVE
NEVER KNOWN ANYONE SO VITALLY ALIVE HE LIVED INTENSELYEVERY FIBRE
OF HIM
TOO INTENSELY MR HOLMES THAT WAS THE RUIN OF HIM YOU REMEMBER
HIM AS HE WASDEBONAIR AND SPLENDID YOU DID NOT SEE THE MOODY
MOROSE BROODING CREATURE INTO WHICH HE DEVELOPED HIS HEART WAS
BROKEN IN A SINGLE MONTH I SEEMED TO SEE MY GALLANT BOY TURN INTO A
WORNOUT CYNICAL MAN
A LOVE AFFAIRA WOMAN
OR A FIEND WELL IT WAS NOT TO TALK OF MY POOR LAD THAT I ASKED YOU
TO COME MR HOLMES
DR WATSON AND I ARE AT YOUR SERVICE
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY STRANGE HAPPENINGS I HAVE BEEN IN THIS
HOUSE MORE THAN A YEAR NOW AND AS I WISHED TO LEAD A RETIRED LIFE I
HAVE SEEN LITTLE OF MY NEIGHBOURS THREE DAYS AGO I HAD A CALL FROM A
MAN WHO SAID THAT HE WAS A HOUSE AGENT HE SAID THAT THIS HOUSE WOULD
EXACTLY SUIT A CLIENT OF HIS AND THAT IF I WOULD PART WITH IT MONEY
WOULD BE NO OBJECT IT SEEMED TO ME VERY STRANGE AS THERE ARE SEVERAL
EMPTY HOUSES ON THE MARKET WHICH APPEAR TO BE EQUALLY ELIGIBLE BUT
NATURALLY I WAS INTERESTED IN WHAT HE SAID I THEREFORE NAMED A PRICE
WHICH WAS FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS MORE THAN I GAVE HE AT ONCE CLOSED
WITH THE OFFER BUT ADDED THAT HIS CLIENT DESIRED TO BUY THE
FURNITURE AS WELL AND WOULD I PUT A PRICE UPON IT SOME OF THIS
FURNITURE IS FROM MY OLD HOME AND IT IS AS YOU SEE VERY GOOD SO
THAT I NAMED A GOOD ROUND SUM TO THIS ALSO HE AT ONCE AGREED I HAD
ALWAYS WANTED TO TRAVEL AND THE BARGAIN WAS SO GOOD A ONE THAT IT
REALLY SEEMED THAT I SHOULD BE MY OWN MISTRESS FOR THE REST OF MY
LIFE
YESTERDAY THE MAN ARRIVED WITH THE AGREEMENT ALL DRAWN OUT LUCKILY
I SHOWED IT TO MR SUTRO MY LAWYER WHO LIVES IN HARROW HE SAID TO
ME THIS IS A VERY STRANGE DOCUMENT ARE YOU AWARE THAT IF YOU SIGN
IT YOU COULD NOT LEGALLY TAKE ANYTHING OUT OF THE HOUSENOT EVEN
YOUR OWN PRIVATE POSSESSIONS WHEN THE MAN CAME AGAIN IN THE EVENING
I POINTED THIS OUT AND I SAID THAT I MEANT ONLY TO SELL THE
FURNITURE
NO NO EVERYTHING SAID HE
BUT MY CLOTHES MY JEWELS
WELL WELL SOME CONCESSION MIGHT BE MADE FOR YOUR PERSONAL
EFFECTS BUT NOTHING SHALL GO OUT OF THE HOUSE UNCHECKED MY CLIENT
IS A VERY LIBERAL MAN BUT HE HAS HIS FADS AND HIS OWN WAY OF DOING
THINGS IT IS EVERYTHING OR NOTHING WITH HIM
THEN IT MUST BE NOTHING SAID I AND THERE THE MATTER WAS LEFT
BUT THE WHOLE THING SEEMED TO ME TO BE SO UNUSUAL THAT I THOUGHT
HERE WE HAD A VERY EXTRAORDINARY INTERRUPTION
HOLMES RAISED HIS HAND FOR SILENCE THEN HE STRODE ACROSS THE ROOM
FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND DRAGGED IN A GREAT GAUNT WOMAN WHOM HE HAD
SEIZED BY THE SHOULDER SHE ENTERED WITH UNGAINLY STRUGGLE LIKE SOME
HUGE AWKWARD CHICKEN TORN SQUAWKING OUT OF ITS COOP
LEAVE ME ALONE WHAT ARE YOU ADOIN OF SHE SCREECHED
WHY SUSAN WHAT IS THIS
WELL MAAM I WAS COMIN IN TO ASK IF THE VISITORS WAS STAYIN FOR
LUNCH WHEN THIS MAN JUMPED OUT AT ME
I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO HER FOR THE LAST FIVE MINUTES BUT DID NOT
WISH TO INTERRUPT YOUR MOST INTERESTING NARRATIVE JUST A LITTLE
WHEEZY SUSAN ARE YOU NOT YOU BREATHE TOO HEAVILY FOR THAT KIND OF
WORK
SUSAN TURNED A SULKY BUT AMAZED FACE UPON HER CAPTOR WHO BE YOU
ANYHOW AND WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU APULLIN ME ABOUT LIKE THIS
IT WAS MERELY THAT I WISHED TO ASK A QUESTION IN YOUR PRESENCE DID
YOU MRS MABERLEY MENTION TO ANYONE THAT YOU WERE GOING TO WRITE TO
ME AND CONSULT ME
NO MR HOLMES I DID NOT
WHO POSTED YOUR LETTER
SUSAN DID
EXACTLY NOW SUSAN TO WHOM WAS IT THAT YOU WROTE OR SENT A MESSAGE
TO SAY THAT YOUR MISTRESS WAS ASKING ADVICE FROM ME
ITS A LIE I SENT NO MESSAGE
NOW SUSAN WHEEZY PEOPLE MAY NOT LIVE LONG YOU KNOW ITS A WICKED
THING TO TELL FIBS WHOM DID YOU TELL
SUSAN CRIED HER MISTRESS I BELIEVE YOU ARE A BAD TREACHEROUS
WOMAN I REMEMBER NOW THAT I SAW YOU SPEAKING TO SOMEONE OVER THE
HEDGE
THAT WAS MY OWN BUSINESS SAID THE WOMAN SULLENLY
SUPPOSE I TELL YOU THAT IT WAS BARNEY STOCKDALE TO WHOM YOU SPOKE
SAID HOLMES
WELL IF YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU WANT TO ASK FOR
I WAS NOT SURE BUT I KNOW NOW WELL NOW SUSAN IT WILL BE WORTH
TEN POUNDS TO YOU IF YOU WILL TELL ME WHO IS AT THE BACK OF BARNEY
SOMEONE THAT COULD LAY DOWN A THOUSAND POUNDS FOR EVERY TEN YOU HAVE
IN THE WORLD
SO A RICH MAN NO YOU SMILEDA RICH WOMAN NOW WE HAVE GOT SO
FAR YOU MAY AS WELL GIVE THE NAME AND EARN THE TENNER
ILL SEE YOU IN HELL FIRST
OH SUSAN LANGUAGE
I AM CLEARING OUT OF HERE IVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU ALL ILL SEND FOR
MY BOX TOMORROW SHE FLOUNCED FOR THE DOOR
GOODBYE SUSAN PAREGORIC IS THE STUFF NOW HE CONTINUED
TURNING SUDDENLY FROM LIVELY TO SEVERE WHEN THE DOOR HAD CLOSED
BEHIND THE FLUSHED AND ANGRY WOMAN THIS GANG MEANS BUSINESS LOOK
HOW CLOSE THEY PLAY THE GAME YOUR LETTER TO ME HAD THE P M
POSTMARK AND YET SUSAN PASSES THE WORD TO BARNEY BARNEY HAS TIME TO
GO TO HIS EMPLOYER AND GET INSTRUCTIONS HE OR SHEI INCLINE TO THE
LATTER FROM SUSANS GRIN WHEN SHE THOUGHT I HAD BLUNDEREDFORMS A
PLAN BLACK STEVE IS CALLED IN AND I AM WARNED OFF BY ELEVEN OCLOCK
NEXT MORNING THATS QUICK WORK YOU KNOW
BUT WHAT DO THEY WANT
YES THATS THE QUESTION WHO HAD THE HOUSE BEFORE YOU
A RETIRED SEA CAPTAIN CALLED FERGUSON
ANYTHING REMARKABLE ABOUT HIM
NOT THAT EVER I HEARD OF
I WAS WONDERING WHETHER HE COULD HAVE BURIED SOMETHING OF COURSE
WHEN PEOPLE BURY TREASURE NOWADAYS THEY DO IT IN THE POSTOFFICE
BANK BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS SOME LUNATICS ABOUT IT WOULD BE A DULL
WORLD WITHOUT THEM AT FIRST I THOUGHT OF SOME BURIED VALUABLE BUT
WHY IN THAT CASE SHOULD THEY WANT YOUR FURNITURE YOU DONT HAPPEN
TO HAVE A RAPHAEL OR A FIRST FOLIO SHAKESPEARE WITHOUT KNOWING IT
NO I DONT THINK I HAVE ANYTHING RARER THAN A CROWN DERBY TEASET
THAT WOULD HARDLY JUSTIFY ALL THIS MYSTERY BESIDES WHY SHOULD THEY
NOT OPENLY STATE WHAT THEY WANT IF THEY COVET YOUR TEASET THEY CAN
SURELY OFFER A PRICE FOR IT WITHOUT BUYING YOU OUT LOCK STOCK AND
BARREL NO AS I READ IT THERE IS SOMETHING WHICH YOU DO NOT KNOW
THAT YOU HAVE AND WHICH YOU WOULD NOT GIVE UP IF YOU DID KNOW
THAT IS HOW I READ IT SAID I
DR WATSON AGREES SO THAT SETTLES IT
WELL MR HOLMES WHAT CAN IT BE
LET US SEE WHETHER BY THIS PURELY MENTAL ANALYSIS WE CAN GET IT TO A
FINER POINT YOU HAVE BEEN IN THIS HOUSE A YEAR
NEARLY TWO
ALL THE BETTER DURING THIS LONG PERIOD NO ONE WANTS ANYTHING FROM
YOU NOW SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS YOU HAVE URGENT DEMANDS
WHAT WOULD YOU GATHER FROM THAT
IT CAN ONLY MEAN SAID I THAT THE OBJECT WHATEVER IT MAY BE HAS
ONLY JUST COME INTO THE HOUSE
SETTLED ONCE AGAIN SAID HOLMES NOW MRS MABERLEY HAS ANY
OBJECT JUST ARRIVED
NO I HAVE BOUGHT NOTHING NEW THIS YEAR
INDEED THAT IS VERY REMARKABLE WELL I THINK WE HAD BEST LET
MATTERS DEVELOP A LITTLE FURTHER UNTIL WE HAVE CLEARER DATA IS THAT
LAWYER OF YOURS A CAPABLE MAN
MR SUTRO IS MOST CAPABLE
HAVE YOU ANOTHER MAID OR WAS THE FAIR SUSAN WHO HAS JUST BANGED
YOUR FRONT DOOR ALONE
I HAVE A YOUNG GIRL
TRY AND GET SUTRO TO SPEND A NIGHT OR TWO IN THE HOUSE YOU MIGHT
POSSIBLY WANT PROTECTION
AGAINST WHOM
WHO KNOWS THE MATTER IS CERTAINLY OBSCURE IF I CANT FIND WHAT
THEY ARE AFTER I MUST APPROACH THE MATTER FROM THE OTHER END AND TRY
TO GET AT THE PRINCIPAL DID THIS HOUSEAGENT MAN GIVE ANY ADDRESS
SIMPLY HIS CARD AND OCCUPATION HAINESJOHNSON AUCTIONEER AND
VALUER

SURVEILLANCE FOR AS WE CAME ROUND THE HIGH HEDGE AT THE END OF THE

SPENCER JOHN CROWD AND THAT STEVE WAS ONE OF THEM NOW WATSON THIS
IS A CASE FOR LANGDALE PIKE AND I AM GOING TO SEE HIM NOW WHEN I
GET BACK I MAY BE CLEARER IN THE MATTER
I SAW NO MORE OF HOLMES DURING THE DAY BUT I COULD WELL IMAGINE HOW
HE SPENT IT FOR LANGDALE PIKE WAS HIS HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON
ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL THIS STRANGE LANGUID CREATURE SPENT
HIS WAKING HOURS IN THE BOW WINDOW OF A ST JAMESS STREET CLUB AND
WAS THE RECEIVINGSTATION AS WELL AS THE TRANSMITTER FOR ALL THE
GOSSIP OF THE METROPOLIS HE MADE IT WAS SAID A FOURFIGURE INCOME
BY THE PARAGRAPHS WHICH HE CONTRIBUTED EVERY WEEK TO THE GARBAGE
PAPERS WHICH CATER TO AN INQUISITIVE PUBLIC IF EVER FAR DOWN IN THE
TURBID DEPTHS OF LONDON LIFE THERE WAS SOME STRANGE SWIRL OR EDDY
IT WAS MARKED WITH AUTOMATIC EXACTNESS BY THIS HUMAN DIAL UPON THE
SURFACE HOLMES DISCREETLY HELPED LANGDALE TO KNOWLEDGE AND ON
OCCASION WAS HELPED IN TURN
WHEN I MET MY FRIEND IN HIS ROOM EARLY NEXT MORNING I WAS CONSCIOUS
FROM HIS BEARING THAT ALL WAS WELL BUT NONE THE LESS A MOST
UNPLEASANT SURPRISE WAS AWAITING US IT TOOK THE SHAPE OF THE
FOLLOWING TELEGRAM
PLEASE COME OUT AT ONCE CLIENTS HOUSE BURGLED IN THE NIGHT POLICE
IN POSSESSION
SUTRO
HOLMES WHISTLED THE DRAMA HAS COME TO A CRISIS AND QUICKER THAN I
HAD EXPECTED THERE IS A GREAT DRIVINGPOWER AT THE BACK OF THIS
BUSINESS WATSON WHICH DOES NOT SURPRISE ME AFTER WHAT I HAVE HEARD
THIS SUTRO OF COURSE IS HER LAWYER I MADE A MISTAKE I FEAR IN
NOT ASKING YOU TO SPEND THE NIGHT ON GUARD THIS FELLOW HAS CLEARLY
PROVED A BROKEN REED WELL THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT ANOTHER
JOURNEY TO HARROW WEALD
WE FOUND THE THREE GABLES A VERY DIFFERENT ESTABLISHMENT TO THE
ORDERLY HOUSEHOLD OF THE PREVIOUS DAY A SMALL GROUP OF IDLERS HAD
ASSEMBLED AT THE GARDEN GATE WHILE A COUPLE OF CONSTABLES WERE
EXAMINING THE WINDOWS AND THE GERANIUM BEDS WITHIN WE MET A GRAY OLD
GENTLEMAN WHO INTRODUCED HIMSELF AS THE LAWYER TOGETHER WITH A
BUSTLING RUBICUND INSPECTOR WHO GREETED HOLMES AS AN OLD FRIEND
WELL MR HOLMES NO CHANCE FOR YOU IN THIS CASE IM AFRAID JUST A
COMMON ORDINARY BURGLARY AND WELL WITHIN THE CAPACITY OF THE POOR
OLD POLICE NO EXPERTS NEED APPLY
I AM SURE THE CASE IS IN VERY GOOD HANDS SAID HOLMES MERELY A
COMMON BURGLARY YOU SAY
QUITE SO WE KNOW PRETTY WELL WHO THE MEN ARE AND WHERE TO FIND
THEM IT IS THAT GANG OF BARNEY STOCKDALE WITH THE BIG NIGGER IN
ITTHEYVE BEEN SEEN ABOUT HERE
EXCELLENT WHAT DID THEY GET

CHLOROFORMED AND THE HOUSE WAS AH HERE IS THE LADY HERSELF
OUR FRIEND OF YESTERDAY LOOKING VERY PALE AND ILL HAD ENTERED THE
ROOM LEANING UPON A LITTLE MAIDSERVANT
YOU GAVE ME GOOD ADVICE MR HOLMES SAID SHE SMILING RUEFULLY
ALAS I DID NOT TAKE IT I DID NOT WISH TO TROUBLE MR SUTRO AND SO
I WAS UNPROTECTED
I ONLY HEARD OF IT THIS MORNING THE LAWYER EXPLAINED
MR HOLMES ADVISED ME TO HAVE SOME FRIEND IN THE HOUSE I NEGLECTED
HIS ADVICE AND I HAVE PAID FOR IT
YOU LOOK WRETCHEDLY ILL SAID HOLMES PERHAPS YOU ARE HARDLY EQUAL
TO TELLING ME WHAT OCCURRED
IT IS ALL HERE SAID THE INSPECTOR TAPPING A BULKY NOTEBOOK
STILL IF THE LADY IS NOT TOO EXHAUSTED
THERE IS REALLY SO LITTLE TO TELL I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WICKED SUSAN
HAD PLANNED AN ENTRANCE FOR THEM THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN THE HOUSE TO
AN INCH I WAS CONSCIOUS FOR A MOMENT OF THE CHLOROFORM RAG WHICH WAS
THRUST OVER MY MOUTH BUT I HAVE NO NOTION HOW LONG I MAY HAVE BEEN
SENSELESS WHEN I WOKE ONE MAN WAS AT THE BEDSIDE AND ANOTHER WAS
RISING WITH A BUNDLE IN HIS HAND FROM AMONG MY SONS BAGGAGE WHICH
WAS PARTIALLY OPENED AND LITTERED OVER THE FLOOR BEFORE HE COULD GET
AWAY I SPRANG UP AND SEIZED HIM
YOU TOOK A BIG RISK SAID THE INSPECTOR
I CLUNG TO HIM BUT HE SHOOK ME OFF AND THE OTHER MAY HAVE STRUCK
ME FOR I CAN REMEMBER NO MORE MARY THE MAID HEARD THE NOISE AND
BEGAN SCREAMING OUT OF THE WINDOW THAT BROUGHT THE POLICE BUT THE
RASCALS HAD GOT AWAY
WHAT DID THEY TAKE
WELL I DONT THINK THERE IS ANYTHING OF VALUE MISSING I AM SURE
THERE WAS NOTHING IN MY SONS TRUNKS
DID THE MEN LEAVE NO CLUE
THERE WAS ONE SHEET OF PAPER WHICH I MAY HAVE TORN FROM THE MAN THAT
I GRASPED IT WAS LYING ALL CRUMPLED ON THE FLOOR IT IS IN MY SONS
HANDWRITING
WHICH MEANS THAT IT IS NOT OF MUCH USE SAID THE INSPECTOR NOW IF
IT HAD BEEN IN THE BURGLARS
EXACTLY SAID HOLMES WHAT RUGGED COMMON SENSE NONE THE LESS I
SHOULD BE CURIOUS TO SEE IT
THE INSPECTOR DREW A FOLDED SHEET OF FOOLSCAP FROM HIS POCKETBOOK
I NEVER PASS ANYTHING HOWEVER TRIFLING SAID HE WITH SOME
POMPOSITY THAT IS MY ADVICE TO YOU MR HOLMES IN TWENTYFIVE
YEARS EXPERIENCE I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON THERE IS ALWAYS THE
CHANCE OF FINGERMARKS OR SOMETHING
HOLMES INSPECTED THE SHEET OF PAPER
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT INSPECTOR
SEEMS TO BE THE END OF SOME QUEER NOVEL SO FAR AS I CAN SEE
IT MAY CERTAINLY PROVE TO BE THE END OF A QUEER TALE SAID HOLMES
YOU HAVE NOTICED THE NUMBER ON THE TOP OF THE PAGE IT IS TWO
HUNDRED AND FORTYFIVE WHERE ARE THE ODD TWO HUNDRED AND FORTYFOUR
PAGES
WELL I SUPPOSE THE BURGLARS GOT THOSE MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO THEM
IT SEEMS A QUEER THING TO BREAK INTO A HOUSE IN ORDER TO STEAL SUCH
PAPERS AS THAT DOES IT SUGGEST ANYTHING TO YOU INSPECTOR
YES SIR IT SUGGESTS THAT IN THEIR HURRY THE RASCALS JUST GRABBED
AT WHAT CAME FIRST TO HAND I WISH THEM JOY OF WHAT THEY GOT
WHY SHOULD THEY GO TO MY SONS THINGS ASKED MRS MABERLEY
WELL THEY FOUND NOTHING VALUABLE DOWNSTAIRS SO THEY TRIED THEIR
LUCK UPSTAIRS THAT IS HOW I READ IT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT MR
HOLMES
I MUST THINK IT OVER INSPECTOR COME TO THE WINDOW WATSON THEN
AS WE STOOD TOGETHER HE READ OVER THE FRAGMENT OF PAPER IT BEGAN IN
THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE AND RAN LIKE THIS
FACE BLED CONSIDERABLY FROM THE CUTS AND BLOWS BUT IT WAS
NOTHING TO THE BLEEDING OF HIS HEART AS HE SAW THAT LOVELY FACE THE
FACE FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN PREPARED TO SACRIFICE HIS VERY LIFE
LOOKING OUT AT HIS AGONY AND HUMILIATION SHE SMILEDYES BY HEAVEN
SHE SMILED LIKE THE HEARTLESS FIEND SHE WAS AS HE LOOKED UP AT HER
IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT THAT LOVE DIED AND HATE WAS BORN MAN MUST LIVE
FOR SOMETHING IF IT IS NOT FOR YOUR EMBRACE MY LADY THEN IT SHALL
SURELY BE FOR YOUR UNDOING AND MY COMPLETE REVENGE
QUEER GRAMMAR SAID HOLMES WITH A SMILE AS HE HANDED THE PAPER BACK
TO THE INSPECTOR DID YOU NOTICE HOW THE HE SUDDENLY CHANGED TO
MY THE WRITER WAS SO CARRIED AWAY BY HIS OWN STORY THAT HE
IMAGINED HIMSELF AT THE SUPREME MOMENT TO BE THE HERO
IT SEEMED MIGHTY POOR STUFF SAID THE INSPECTOR AS HE REPLACED IT
IN HIS BOOK WHAT ARE YOU OFF MR HOLMES
I DONT THINK THERE IS ANYTHING MORE FOR ME TO DO NOW THAT THE CASE
IS IN SUCH CAPABLE HANDS BY THE WAY MRS MABERLEY DID YOU SAY YOU
WISHED TO TRAVEL
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM MR HOLMES
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GOCAIRO MADEIRA THE RIVIERA
OH IF I HAD THE MONEY I WOULD GO ROUND THE WORLD
QUITE SO ROUND THE WORLD WELL GOODMORNING I MAY DROP YOU A LINE
IN THE EVENING AS WE PASSED THE WINDOW I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE
INSPECTORS SMILE AND SHAKE OF THE HEAD THESE CLEVER FELLOWS HAVE
ALWAYS A TOUCH OF MADNESS THAT WAS WHAT I READ IN THE INSPECTORS
SMILE
NOW WATSON WE ARE AT THE LAST LAP OF OUR LITTLE JOURNEY SAID
HOLMES WHEN WE WERE BACK IN THE ROAR OF CENTRAL LONDON ONCE MORE I
THINK WE HAD BEST CLEAR THE MATTER UP AT ONCE AND IT WOULD BE WELL
THAT YOU SHOULD COME WITH ME FOR IT IS SAFER TO HAVE A WITNESS WHEN
YOU ARE DEALING WITH SUCH A LADY AS ISADORA KLEIN
WE HAD TAKEN A CAB AND WERE SPEEDING TO SOME ADDRESS IN GROSVENOR
SQUARE HOLMES HAD BEEN SUNK IN THOUGHT BUT HE ROUSED HIMSELF
SUDDENLY
BY THE WAY WATSON I SUPPOSE YOU SEE IT ALL CLEARLY
NO I CANT SAY THAT I DO I ONLY GATHER THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE
THE LADY WHO IS BEHIND ALL THIS MISCHIEF
EXACTLY BUT DOES THE NAME ISADORA KLEIN CONVEY NOTHING TO YOU SHE
WAS OF COURSE THE CELEBRATED BEAUTY THERE WAS NEVER A WOMAN TO
TOUCH HER SHE IS PURE SPANISH THE REAL BLOOD OF THE MASTERFUL
CONQUISTADORS AND HER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEADERS IN PERNAMBUCO FOR
GENERATIONS SHE MARRIED THE AGED GERMAN SUGAR KING KLEIN AND
PRESENTLY FOUND HERSELF THE RICHEST AS WELL AS THE MOST LOVELY WIDOW
UPON EARTH THEN THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF ADVENTURE WHEN SHE PLEASED
HER OWN TASTES SHE HAD SEVERAL LOVERS AND DOUGLAS MABERLEY ONE OF
THE MOST STRIKING MEN IN LONDON WAS ONE OF THEM IT WAS BY ALL
ACCOUNTS MORE THAN AN ADVENTURE WITH HIM HE WAS NOT A SOCIETY
BUTTERFLY BUT A STRONG PROUD MAN WHO GAVE AND EXPECTED ALL BUT SHE
IS THE BELLE DAME SANS MERCI OF FICTION WHEN HER CAPRICE IS
SATISFIED THE MATTER IS ENDED AND IF THE OTHER PARTY IN THE MATTER
CANT TAKE HER WORD FOR IT SHE KNOWS HOW TO BRING IT HOME TO HIM
THEN THAT WAS HIS OWN STORY
AH YOU ARE PIECING IT TOGETHER NOW I HEAR THAT SHE IS ABOUT TO
MARRY THE YOUNG DUKE OF LOMOND WHO MIGHT ALMOST BE HER SON HIS
GRACES MA MIGHT OVERLOOK THE AGE BUT A BIG SCANDAL WOULD BE A
DIFFERENT MATTER SO IT IS IMPERATIVE AH HERE WE ARE
IT WAS ONE OF THE FINEST CORNERHOUSES OF THE WEST END A
MACHINELIKE FOOTMAN TOOK UP OUR CARDS AND RETURNED WITH WORD THAT
THE LADY WAS NOT AT HOME THEN WE SHALL WAIT UNTIL SHE IS SAID
HOLMES CHEERFULLY
THE MACHINE BROKE DOWN
NOT AT HOME MEANS NOT AT HOME TO YOU SAID THE FOOTMAN
GOOD HOLMES ANSWERED THAT MEANS THAT WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO WAIT
KINDLY GIVE THIS NOTE TO YOUR MISTRESS
HE SCRIBBLED THREE OR FOUR WORDS UPON A SHEET OF HIS NOTEBOOK FOLDED
IT AND HANDED IT TO THE MAN
WHAT DID YOU SAY HOLMES I ASKED
I SIMPLY WROTE SHALL IT BE THE POLICE THEN I THINK THAT SHOULD
PASS US IN
IT DIDWITH AMAZING CELERITY A MINUTE LATER WE WERE IN AN ARABIAN
NIGHTS DRAWINGROOM VAST AND WONDERFUL IN A HALF GLOOM PICKED OUT
WITH AN OCCASIONAL PINK ELECTRIC LIGHT THE LADY HAD COME I FELT TO
THAT TIME OF LIFE WHEN EVEN THE PROUDEST BEAUTY FINDS THE HALF LIGHT
MORE WELCOME SHE ROSE FROM A SETTEE AS WE ENTERED TALL QUEENLY A
PERFECT FIGURE A LOVELY MASKLIKE FACE WITH TWO WONDERFUL SPANISH
EYES WHICH LOOKED MURDER AT US BOTH
WHAT IS THIS INTRUSIONAND THIS INSULTING MESSAGE SHE ASKED
HOLDING UP THE SLIP OF PAPER
I NEED NOT EXPLAIN MADAME I HAVE TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR YOUR
INTELLIGENCE TO DO SOTHOUGH I CONFESS THAT INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN
SURPRISINGLY AT FAULT OF LATE
HOW SO SIR
BY SUPPOSING THAT YOUR HIRED BULLIES COULD FRIGHTEN ME FROM MY WORK
SURELY NO MAN WOULD TAKE UP MY PROFESSION IF IT WERE NOT THAT DANGER
ATTRACTS HIM IT WAS YOU THEN WHO FORCED ME TO EXAMINE THE CASE OF
YOUNG MABERLEY
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH
HIRED BULLIES
HOLMES TURNED AWAY WEARILY
YES I HAVE UNDERRATED YOUR INTELLIGENCE WELL GOODAFTERNOON
STOP WHERE ARE YOU GOING
TO SCOTLAND YARD
WE HAD NOT GOT HALFWAY TO THE DOOR BEFORE SHE HAD OVERTAKEN US AND
WAS HOLDING HIS ARM SHE HAD TURNED IN A MOMENT FROM STEEL TO VELVET
COME AND SIT DOWN GENTLEMEN LET US TALK THIS MATTER OVER I FEEL
THAT I MAY BE FRANK WITH YOU MR HOLMES YOU HAVE THE FEELINGS OF A
GENTLEMAN HOW QUICK A WOMANS INSTINCT IS TO FIND IT OUT I WILL
TREAT YOU AS A FRIEND
I CANNOT PROMISE TO RECIPROCATE MADAME I AM NOT THE LAW BUT I
REPRESENT JUSTICE SO FAR AS MY FEEBLE POWERS GO I AM READY TO
LISTEN AND THEN I WILL TELL YOU HOW I WILL ACT
NO DOUBT IT WAS FOOLISH OF ME TO THREATEN A BRAVE MAN LIKE
YOURSELF
WHAT WAS REALLY FOOLISH MADAME IS THAT YOU HAVE PLACED YOURSELF IN
THE POWER OF A BAND OF RASCALS WHO MAY BLACKMAIL OR GIVE YOU AWAY
NO NO I AM NOT SO SIMPLE SINCE I HAVE PROMISED TO BE FRANK I MAY
SAY THAT NO ONE SAVE BARNEY STOCKDALE AND SUSAN HIS WIFE HAVE THE
LEAST IDEA WHO THEIR EMPLOYER IS AS TO THEM WELL IT IS NOT THE
FIRST SHE SMILED AND NODDED WITH A CHARMING COQUETTISH INTIMACY
I SEE YOUVE TESTED THEM BEFORE
THEY ARE GOOD HOUNDS WHO RUN SILENT
SUCH HOUNDS HAVE A WAY SOONER OR LATER OF BITING THE HAND THAT FEEDS
THEM THEY WILL BE ARRESTED FOR THIS BURGLARY THE POLICE ARE ALREADY
AFTER THEM
THEY WILL TAKE WHAT COMES TO THEM THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE PAID FOR I
SHALL NOT APPEAR IN THE MATTER
UNLESS I BRING YOU INTO IT
NO NO YOU WOULD NOT YOU ARE A GENTLEMAN IT IS A WOMANS SECRET
IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU MUST GIVE BACK THIS MANUSCRIPT
SHE BROKE INTO A RIPPLE OF LAUGHTER AND WALKED TO THE FIREPLACE
THERE WAS A CALCINED MASS WHICH SHE BROKE UP WITH THE POKER SHALL I
GIVE THIS BACK SHE ASKED SO ROGUISH AND EXQUISITE DID SHE LOOK AS
SHE STOOD BEFORE US WITH A CHALLENGING SMILE THAT I FELT OF ALL
HOLMESS CRIMINALS THIS WAS THE ONE WHOM HE WOULD FIND IT HARDEST TO
FACE HOWEVER HE WAS IMMUNE FROM SENTIMENT
THAT SEALS YOUR FATE HE SAID COLDLY YOU ARE VERY PROMPT IN YOUR
ACTIONS MADAME BUT YOU HAVE OVERDONE IT ON THIS OCCASION
SHE THREW THE POKER DOWN WITH A CLATTER
HOW HARD YOU ARE SHE CRIED MAY I TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY
I FANCY I COULD TELL IT TO YOU
BUT YOU MUST LOOK AT IT WITH MY EYES MR HOLMES YOU MUST REALIZE
IT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A WOMAN WHO SEES ALL HER LIFES AMBITION
ABOUT TO BE RUINED AT THE LAST MOMENT IS SUCH A WOMAN TO BE BLAMED
IF SHE PROTECTS HERSELF
THE ORIGINAL SIN WAS YOURS
YES YES I ADMIT IT HE WAS A DEAR BOY DOUGLAS BUT IT SO CHANCED
THAT HE COULD NOT FIT INTO MY PLANS HE WANTED MARRIAGEMARRIAGE
MR HOLMESWITH A PENNILESS COMMONER NOTHING LESS WOULD SERVE HIM
THEN HE BECAME PERTINACIOUS BECAUSE I HAD GIVEN HE SEEMED TO THINK
THAT I STILL MUST GIVE AND TO HIM ONLY IT WAS INTOLERABLE AT LAST
I HAD TO MAKE HIM REALIZE IT
BY HIRING RUFFIANS TO BEAT HIM UNDER YOUR OWN WINDOW
YOU DO INDEED SEEM TO KNOW EVERYTHING WELL IT IS TRUE BARNEY AND
THE BOYS DROVE HIM AWAY AND WERE I ADMIT A LITTLE ROUGH IN DOING
SO BUT WHAT DID HE DO THEN COULD I HAVE BELIEVED THAT A GENTLEMAN
WOULD DO SUCH AN ACT HE WROTE A BOOK IN WHICH HE DESCRIBED HIS OWN
STORY I OF COURSE WAS THE WOLF HE THE LAMB IT WAS ALL THERE
UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES OF COURSE BUT WHO IN ALL LONDON WOULD HAVE
FAILED TO RECOGNIZE IT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT MR HOLMES
WELL HE WAS WITHIN HIS RIGHTS
IT WAS AS IF THE AIR OF ITALY HAD GOT INTO HIS BLOOD AND BROUGHT
WITH IT THE OLD CRUEL ITALIAN SPIRIT HE WROTE TO ME AND SENT ME A
COPY OF HIS BOOK THAT I MIGHT HAVE THE TORTURE OF ANTICIPATION THERE
WERE TWO COPIES HE SAIDONE FOR ME ONE FOR HIS PUBLISHER
HOW DID YOU KNOW THE PUBLISHERS HAD NOT REACHED HIM
I KNEW WHO HIS PUBLISHER WAS IT IS NOT HIS ONLY NOVEL YOU KNOW I
FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD NOT HEARD FROM ITALY THEN CAME DOUGLASS
SUDDEN DEATH SO LONG AS THAT OTHER MANUSCRIPT WAS IN THE WORLD THERE
WAS NO SAFETY FOR ME OF COURSE IT MUST BE AMONG HIS EFFECTS AND
THESE WOULD BE RETURNED TO HIS MOTHER I SET THE GANG AT WORK ONE OF
THEM GOT INTO THE HOUSE AS SERVANT I WANTED TO DO THE THING
HONESTLY I REALLY AND TRULY DID I WAS READY TO BUY THE HOUSE AND
EVERYTHING IN IT I OFFERED ANY PRICE SHE CARED TO ASK I ONLY TRIED
THE OTHER WAY WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE HAD FAILED NOW MR HOLMES
GRANTING THAT I WAS TOO HARD ON DOUGLASAND GOD KNOWS I AM SORRY
FOR ITWHAT ELSE COULD I DO WITH MY WHOLE FUTURE AT STAKE
SHERLOCK HOLMES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
WELL WELL SAID HE I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO COMPOUND A FELONY
AS USUAL HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO GO ROUND THE WORLD IN FIRSTCLASS
STYLE
THE LADY STARED IN AMAZEMENT
COULD IT BE DONE ON FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS
WELL I SHOULD THINK SO INDEED
VERY GOOD I THINK YOU WILL SIGN ME A CHECK FOR THAT AND I WILL SEE
THAT IT COMES TO MRS MABERLEY YOU OWE HER A LITTLE CHANGE OF AIR
MEANTIME LADYHE WAGGED A CAUTIONARY FOREFINGERHAVE A CARE
HAVE A CARE YOU CANT PLAY WITH EDGED TOOLS FOREVER WITHOUT CUTTING
THOSE DAINTY HANDS
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE
HOLMES HAD READ CAREFULLY A NOTE WHICH THE LAST POST HAD BROUGHT HIM
THEN WITH THE DRY CHUCKLE WHICH WAS HIS NEAREST APPROACH TO A
LAUGH HE TOSSED IT OVER TO ME
FOR A MIXTURE OF THE MODERN AND THE MEDIAEVAL OF THE PRACTICAL AND
OF THE WILDLY FANCIFUL I THINK THIS IS SURELY THE LIMIT SAID HE WHAT
DO YOU MAKE OF IT WATSON
I READ AS FOLLOWS
OLD JEWRY
NOV TH
RE VAMPIRES
SIR
OUR CLIENT MR ROBERT FERGUSON OF FERGUSON AND MUIRHEAD TEA
BROKERS OF MINCING LANE HAS MADE SOME INQUIRY FROM US IN A
COMMUNICATION OF EVEN DATE CONCERNING VAMPIRES AS OUR FIRM
SPECIALIZES ENTIRELY UPON THE ASSESSMENT OF MACHINERY THE MATTER
HARDLY COMES WITHIN OUR PURVIEW AND WE HAVE THEREFORE RECOMMENDED
MR FERGUSON TO CALL UPON YOU AND LAY THE MATTER BEFORE YOU WE HAVE
NOT FORGOTTEN YOUR SUCCESSFUL ACTION IN THE CASE OF MATILDA BRIGGS
WE ARE SIR
FAITHFULLY YOURS
MORRISON MORRISON AND DODD
PER E J C
MATILDA BRIGGS WAS NOT THE NAME OF A YOUNG WOMAN WATSON SAID
HOLMES IN A REMINISCENT VOICE IT WAS A SHIP WHICH IS ASSOCIATED
WITH THE GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET
PREPARED BUT WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT VAMPIRES DOES IT COME WITHIN OUR
PURVIEW EITHER ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN STAGNATION BUT REALLY WE
SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SWITCHED ON TO A GRIMMS FAIRY TALE MAKE A LONG
ARM WATSON AND SEE WHAT V HAS TO SAY
I LEANED BACK AND TOOK DOWN THE GREAT INDEX VOLUME TO WHICH HE
REFERRED HOLMES BALANCED IT ON HIS KNEE AND HIS EYES MOVED SLOWLY
AND LOVINGLY OVER THE RECORD OF OLD CASES MIXED WITH THE ACCUMULATED
INFORMATION OF A LIFETIME
VOYAGE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT HE READ THAT WAS A BAD BUSINESS I
HAVE SOME RECOLLECTION THAT YOU MADE A RECORD OF IT WATSON THOUGH I
WAS UNABLE TO CONGRATULATE YOU UPON THE RESULT VICTOR LYNCH THE
FORGER VENOMOUS LIZARD OR GILA REMARKABLE CASE THAT VITTORIA
THE CIRCUS BELLE VANDERBILT AND THE YEGGMAN VIPERS VIGOR THE
HAMMERSMITH WONDER HULLO HULLO GOOD OLD INDEX YOU CANT BEAT IT
LISTEN TO THIS WATSON VAMPIRISM IN HUNGARY AND AGAIN VAMPIRES IN
TRANSYLVANIA HE TURNED OVER THE PAGES WITH EAGERNESS BUT AFTER A
SHORT INTENT PERUSAL HE THREW DOWN THE GREAT BOOK WITH A SNARL OF
DISAPPOINTMENT
RUBBISH WATSON RUBBISH WHAT HAVE WE TO DO WITH WALKING CORPSES
WHO CAN ONLY BE HELD IN THEIR GRAVE BY STAKES DRIVEN THROUGH THEIR
HEARTS ITS PURE LUNACY
BUT SURELY SAID I THE VAMPIRE WAS NOT NECESSARILY A DEAD MAN A
LIVING PERSON MIGHT HAVE THE HABIT I HAVE READ FOR EXAMPLE OF THE
OLD SUCKING THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG IN ORDER TO RETAIN THEIR YOUTH
YOU ARE RIGHT WATSON IT MENTIONS THE LEGEND IN ONE OF THESE
REFERENCES BUT ARE WE TO GIVE SERIOUS ATTENTION TO SUCH THINGS THIS
AGENCY STANDS FLATFOOTED UPON THE GROUND AND THERE IT MUST REMAIN
THE WORLD IS BIG ENOUGH FOR US NO GHOSTS NEED APPLY I FEAR THAT WE
CANNOT TAKE MR ROBERT FERGUSON VERY SERIOUSLY POSSIBLY THIS NOTE
MAY BE FROM HIM AND MAY THROW SOME LIGHT UPON WHAT IS WORRYING HIM
HE TOOK UP A SECOND LETTER WHICH HAD LAIN UNNOTICED UPON THE TABLE
WHILE HE HAD BEEN ABSORBED WITH THE FIRST THIS HE BEGAN TO READ WITH
A SMILE OF AMUSEMENT UPON HIS FACE WHICH GRADUALLY FADED AWAY INTO AN
EXPRESSION OF INTENSE INTEREST AND CONCENTRATION WHEN HE HAD
FINISHED HE SAT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME LOST IN THOUGHT WITH THE LETTER
DANGLING FROM HIS FINGERS FINALLY WITH A START HE AROUSED HIMSELF
FROM HIS REVERIE
CHEESEMANS LAMBERLEY WHERE IS LAMBERLEY WATSON
IT IS IN SUSSEX SOUTH OF HORSHAM
NOT VERY FAR EH AND CHEESEMANS
I KNOW THAT COUNTRY HOLMES IT IS FULL OF OLD HOUSES WHICH ARE
NAMED AFTER THE MEN WHO BUILT THEM CENTURIES AGO YOU GET ODLEYS AND
HARVEYS AND CARRITONSTHE FOLK ARE FORGOTTEN BUT THEIR NAMES LIVE
IN THEIR HOUSES
PRECISELY SAID HOLMES COLDLY IT WAS ONE OF THE PECULIARITIES OF
HIS PROUD SELFCONTAINED NATURE THAT THOUGH HE DOCKETED ANY FRESH
INFORMATION VERY QUIETLY AND ACCURATELY IN HIS BRAIN HE SELDOM MADE
ANY ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO THE GIVER I RATHER FANCY WE SHALL KNOW A GOOD
DEAL MORE ABOUT CHEESEMANS LAMBERLEY BEFORE WE ARE THROUGH THE
LETTER IS AS I HAD HOPED FROM ROBERT FERGUSON BY THE WAY HE
CLAIMS ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOU
WITH ME
YOU HAD BETTER READ IT
HE HANDED THE LETTER ACROSS IT WAS HEADED WITH THE ADDRESS QUOTED
DEAR MR HOLMES IT SAID
I HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED TO YOU BY MY LAWYERS BUT INDEED THE MATTER
IS SO EXTRAORDINARILY DELICATE THAT IT IS MOST DIFFICULT TO DISCUSS
IT CONCERNS A FRIEND FOR WHOM I AM ACTING THIS GENTLEMAN MARRIED
SOME FIVE YEARS AGO A PERUVIAN LADY THE DAUGHTER OF A PERUVIAN
MERCHANT WHOM HE HAD MET IN CONNECTION WITH THE IMPORTATION OF
NITRATES THE LADY WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT THE FACT OF HER FOREIGN
BIRTH AND OF HER ALIEN RELIGION ALWAYS CAUSED A SEPARATION OF
INTERESTS AND OF FEELINGS BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE SO THAT AFTER A
TIME HIS LOVE MAY HAVE COOLED TOWARDS HER AND HE MAY HAVE COME TO
REGARD THEIR UNION AS A MISTAKE HE FELT THERE WERE SIDES OF HER
CHARACTER WHICH HE COULD NEVER EXPLORE OR UNDERSTAND THIS WAS THE
MORE PAINFUL AS SHE WAS AS LOVING A WIFE AS A MAN COULD HAVETO ALL
APPEARANCE ABSOLUTELY DEVOTED
NOW FOR THE POINT WHICH I WILL MAKE MORE PLAIN WHEN WE MEET INDEED
THIS NOTE IS MERELY TO GIVE YOU A GENERAL IDEA OF THE SITUATION AND
TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER YOU WOULD CARE TO INTEREST YOURSELF IN THE
MATTER THE LADY BEGAN TO SHOW SOME CURIOUS TRAITS QUITE ALIEN TO HER
ORDINARILY SWEET AND GENTLE DISPOSITION THE GENTLEMAN HAD BEEN
MARRIED TWICE AND HE HAD ONE SON BY THE FIRST WIFE THIS BOY WAS NOW
FIFTEEN A VERY CHARMING AND AFFECTIONATE YOUTH THOUGH UNHAPPILY
INJURED THROUGH AN ACCIDENT IN CHILDHOOD TWICE THE WIFE WAS CAUGHT
IN THE ACT OF ASSAULTING THIS POOR LAD IN THE MOST UNPROVOKED WAY
ONCE SHE STRUCK HIM WITH A STICK AND LEFT A GREAT WEAL ON HIS ARM
THIS WAS A SMALL MATTER HOWEVER COMPARED WITH HER CONDUCT TO HER
OWN CHILD A DEAR BOY JUST UNDER ONE YEAR OF AGE ON ONE OCCASION
ABOUT A MONTH AGO THIS CHILD HAD BEEN LEFT BY ITS NURSE FOR A FEW
MINUTES A LOUD CRY FROM THE BABY AS OF PAIN CALLED THE NURSE BACK
AS SHE RAN INTO THE ROOM SHE SAW HER EMPLOYER THE LADY LEANING OVER
THE BABY AND APPARENTLY BITING HIS NECK THERE WAS A SMALL WOUND IN
THE NECK FROM WHICH A STREAM OF BLOOD HAD ESCAPED THE NURSE WAS SO
HORRIFIED THAT SHE WISHED TO CALL THE HUSBAND BUT THE LADY IMPLORED
HER NOT TO DO SO AND ACTUALLY GAVE HER FIVE POUNDS AS A PRICE FOR HER
SILENCE NO EXPLANATION WAS EVER GIVEN AND FOR THE MOMENT THE MATTER
WAS PASSED OVER
IT LEFT HOWEVER A TERRIBLE IMPRESSION UPON THE NURSES MIND AND
FROM THAT TIME SHE BEGAN TO WATCH HER MISTRESS CLOSELY AND TO KEEP A
CLOSER GUARD UPON THE BABY WHOM SHE TENDERLY LOVED IT SEEMED TO HER
THAT EVEN AS SHE WATCHED THE MOTHER SO THE MOTHER WATCHED HER AND
THAT EVERY TIME SHE WAS COMPELLED TO LEAVE THE BABY ALONE THE MOTHER
WAS WAITING TO GET AT IT DAY AND NIGHT THE NURSE COVERED THE CHILD
AND DAY AND NIGHT THE SILENT WATCHFUL MOTHER SEEMED TO BE LYING IN
WAIT AS A WOLF WAITS FOR A LAMB IT MUST READ MOST INCREDIBLE TO YOU
AND YET I BEG YOU TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY FOR A CHILDS LIFE AND A
MANS SANITY MAY DEPEND UPON IT
AT LAST THERE CAME ONE DREADFUL DAY WHEN THE FACTS COULD NO LONGER BE
CONCEALED FROM THE HUSBAND THE NURSES NERVE HAD GIVEN WAY SHE
COULD STAND THE STRAIN NO LONGER AND SHE MADE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT
ALL TO THE MAN TO HIM IT SEEMED AS WILD A TALE AS IT MAY NOW SEEM TO
YOU HE KNEW HIS WIFE TO BE A LOVING WIFE AND SAVE FOR THE ASSAULTS
UPON HER STEPSON A LOVING MOTHER WHY THEN SHOULD SHE WOUND HER
OWN DEAR LITTLE BABY HE TOLD THE NURSE THAT SHE WAS DREAMING THAT
HER SUSPICIONS WERE THOSE OF A LUNATIC AND THAT SUCH LIBELS UPON HER
MISTRESS WERE NOT TO BE TOLERATED WHILE THEY WERE TALKING A SUDDEN
CRY OF PAIN WAS HEARD NURSE AND MASTER RUSHED TOGETHER TO THE
NURSERY IMAGINE HIS FEELINGS MR HOLMES AS HE SAW HIS WIFE RISE
FROM A KNEELING POSITION BESIDE THE COT AND SAW BLOOD UPON THE
CHILDS EXPOSED NECK AND UPON THE SHEET WITH A CRY OF HORROR HE
TURNED HIS WIFES FACE TO THE LIGHT AND SAW BLOOD ALL ROUND HER LIPS
IT WAS SHESHE BEYOND ALL QUESTIONWHO HAD DRUNK THE POOR BABYS
BLOOD
SO THE MATTER STANDS SHE IS NOW CONFINED TO HER ROOM THERE HAS BEEN
NO EXPLANATION THE HUSBAND IS HALF DEMENTED HE KNOWS AND I KNOW
LITTLE OF VAMPIRISM BEYOND THE NAME WE HAD THOUGHT IT WAS SOME WILD
TALE OF FOREIGN PARTS AND YET HERE IN THE VERY HEART OF THE ENGLISH
SUSSEXWELL ALL THIS CAN BE DISCUSSED WITH YOU IN THE MORNING WILL
YOU SEE ME WILL YOU USE YOUR GREAT POWERS IN AIDING A DISTRACTED
MAN IF SO KINDLY WIRE TO FERGUSON CHEESEMANS LAMBERLEY AND I
WILL BE AT YOUR ROOMS BY TEN OCLOCK
YOURS FAITHFULLY
ROBERT FERGUSON
P S I BELIEVE YOUR FRIEND WATSON PLAYED RUGBY FOR BLACKHEATH WHEN I
WAS THREEQUARTER FOR RICHMOND IT IS THE ONLY PERSONAL INTRODUCTION
WHICH I CAN GIVE
OF COURSE I REMEMBERED HIM SAID I AS I LAID DOWN THE LETTER BIG
BOB FERGUSON THE FINEST THREEQUARTER RICHMOND EVER HAD HE WAS
ALWAYS A GOODNATURED CHAP ITS LIKE HIM TO BE SO CONCERNED OVER A
FRIENDS CASE
HOLMES LOOKED AT ME THOUGHTFULLY AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
I NEVER GET YOUR LIMITS WATSON SAID HE THERE ARE UNEXPLORED
POSSIBILITIES ABOUT YOU TAKE A WIRE DOWN LIKE A GOOD FELLOW WILL
EXAMINE YOUR CASE WITH PLEASURE
YOUR CASE
WE MUST NOT LET HIM THINK THAT THIS AGENCY IS A HOME FOR THE
WEAKMINDED OF COURSE IT IS HIS CASE SEND HIM THAT WIRE AND LET THE
MATTER REST TILL MORNING
PROMPTLY AT TEN OCLOCK NEXT MORNING FERGUSON STRODE INTO OUR ROOM I
HAD REMEMBERED HIM AS A LONG SLABSIDED MAN WITH LOOSE LIMBS AND A
FINE TURN OF SPEED WHICH HAD CARRIED HIM ROUND MANY AN OPPOSING BACK
THERE IS SURELY NOTHING IN LIFE MORE PAINFUL THAN TO MEET THE WRECK
OF A FINE ATHLETE WHOM ONE HAS KNOWN IN HIS PRIME HIS GREAT FRAME
HAD FALLEN IN HIS FLAXEN HAIR WAS SCANTY AND HIS SHOULDERS WERE
BOWED I FEAR THAT I ROUSED CORRESPONDING EMOTIONS IN HIM
HULLO WATSON SAID HE AND HIS VOICE WAS STILL DEEP AND HEARTY
YOU DONT LOOK QUITE THE MAN YOU DID WHEN I THREW YOU OVER THE ROPES
INTO THE CROWD AT THE OLD DEER PARK I EXPECT I HAVE CHANGED A BIT
ALSO BUT ITS THIS LAST DAY OR TWO THAT HAS AGED ME I SEE BY YOUR
TELEGRAM MR HOLMES THAT IT IS NO USE MY PRETENDING TO BE ANYONES
DEPUTY
IT IS SIMPLER TO DEAL DIRECT SAID HOLMES
OF COURSE IT IS BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS WHEN YOU
ARE SPEAKING OF THE ONE WOMAN WHOM YOU ARE BOUND TO PROTECT AND HELP
WHAT CAN I DO HOW AM I TO GO TO THE POLICE WITH SUCH A STORY AND
YET THE KIDDIES HAVE GOT TO BE PROTECTED IS IT MADNESS MR HOLMES
IS IT SOMETHING IN THE BLOOD HAVE YOU ANY SIMILAR CASE IN YOUR
EXPERIENCE FOR GODS SAKE GIVE ME SOME ADVICE FOR I AM AT MY WITS
END
VERY NATURALLY MR FERGUSON NOW SIT HERE AND PULL YOURSELF
TOGETHER AND GIVE ME A FEW CLEAR ANSWERS I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT I AM
VERY FAR FROM BEING AT MY WITS END AND THAT I AM CONFIDENT WE SHALL
FIND SOME SOLUTION FIRST OF ALL TELL ME WHAT STEPS YOU HAVE TAKEN
IS YOUR WIFE STILL NEAR THE CHILDREN
WE HAD A DREADFUL SCENE SHE IS A MOST LOVING WOMAN MR HOLMES IF
EVER A WOMAN LOVED A MAN WITH ALL HER HEART AND SOUL SHE LOVES ME
SHE WAS CUT TO THE HEART THAT I SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED THIS HORRIBLE
THIS INCREDIBLE SECRET SHE WOULD NOT EVEN SPEAK SHE GAVE NO ANSWER
TO MY REPROACHES SAVE TO GAZE AT ME WITH A SORT OF WILD DESPAIRING
LOOK IN HER EYES THEN SHE RUSHED TO HER ROOM AND LOCKED HERSELF IN
SINCE THEN SHE HAS REFUSED TO SEE ME SHE HAS A MAID WHO WAS WITH HER
BEFORE HER MARRIAGE DOLORES BY NAMEA FRIEND RATHER THAN A SERVANT
SHE TAKES HER FOOD TO HER
THEN THE CHILD IS IN NO IMMEDIATE DANGER
MRS MASON THE NURSE HAS SWORN THAT SHE WILL NOT LEAVE IT NIGHT OR
DAY I CAN ABSOLUTELY TRUST HER I AM MORE UNEASY ABOUT POOR LITTLE
JACK FOR AS I TOLD YOU IN MY NOTE HE HAS TWICE BEEN ASSAULTED BY
HER
BUT NEVER WOUNDED
NO SHE STRUCK HIM SAVAGELY IT IS THE MORE TERRIBLE AS HE IS A POOR
LITTLE INOFFENSIVE CRIPPLE FERGUSONS GAUNT FEATURES SOFTENED AS HE
SPOKE OF HIS BOY YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE DEAR LADS CONDITION
WOULD SOFTEN ANYONES HEART A FALL IN CHILDHOOD AND A TWISTED SPINE
MR HOLMES BUT THE DEAREST MOST LOVING HEART WITHIN
HOLMES HAD PICKED UP THE LETTER OF YESTERDAY AND WAS READING IT OVER
WHAT OTHER INMATES ARE THERE IN YOUR HOUSE MR FERGUSON
TWO SERVANTS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN LONG WITH US ONE STABLEHAND
MICHAEL WHO SLEEPS IN THE HOUSE MY WIFE MYSELF MY BOY JACK BABY
DOLORES AND MRS MASON THAT IS ALL
I GATHER THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW YOUR WIFE WELL AT THE TIME OF YOUR
MARRIAGE
I HAD ONLY KNOWN HER A FEW WEEKS
HOW LONG HAD THIS MAID DOLORES BEEN WITH HER
SOME YEARS
THEN YOUR WIFES CHARACTER WOULD REALLY BE BETTER KNOWN BY DOLORES
THAN BY YOU
YES YOU MAY SAY SO
HOLMES MADE A NOTE
I FANCY SAID HE THAT I MAY BE OF MORE USE AT LAMBERLEY THAN
HERE IT IS EMINENTLY A CASE FOR PERSONAL INVESTIGATION IF THE LADY
REMAINS IN HER ROOM OUR PRESENCE COULD NOT ANNOY OR INCONVENIENCE
HER OF COURSE WE WOULD STAY AT THE INN
FERGUSON GAVE A GESTURE OF RELIEF
IT IS WHAT I HOPED MR HOLMES THERE IS AN EXCELLENT TRAIN AT TWO
FROM VICTORIA IF YOU COULD COME
OF COURSE WE COULD COME THERE IS A LULL AT PRESENT I CAN GIVE YOU
MY UNDIVIDED ENERGIES WATSON OF COURSE COMES WITH US BUT THERE
ARE ONE OR TWO POINTS UPON WHICH I WISH TO BE VERY SURE BEFORE I
START THIS UNHAPPY LADY AS I UNDERSTAND IT HAS APPEARED TO ASSAULT
BOTH THE CHILDREN HER OWN BABY AND YOUR LITTLE SON
THAT IS SO
BUT THE ASSAULTS TAKE DIFFERENT FORMS DO THEY NOT SHE HAS BEATEN
YOUR SON
ONCE WITH A STICK AND ONCE VERY SAVAGELY WITH HER HANDS
DID SHE GIVE NO EXPLANATION WHY SHE STRUCK HIM
NONE SAVE THAT SHE HATED HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN SHE SAID SO
WELL THAT IS NOT UNKNOWN AMONG STEPMOTHERS A POSTHUMOUS JEALOUSY
WE WILL SAY IS THE LADY JEALOUS BY NATURE
YES SHE IS VERY JEALOUSJEALOUS WITH ALL THE STRENGTH OF HER FIERY
TROPICAL LOVE
BUT THE BOYHE IS FIFTEEN I UNDERSTAND AND PROBABLY VERY
DEVELOPED IN MIND SINCE HIS BODY HAS BEEN CIRCUMSCRIBED IN ACTION
DID HE GIVE YOU NO EXPLANATION OF THESE ASSAULTS
NO HE DECLARED THERE WAS NO REASON
WERE THEY GOOD FRIENDS AT OTHER TIMES
NO THERE WAS NEVER ANY LOVE BETWEEN THEM
YET YOU SAY HE IS AFFECTIONATE
NEVER IN THE WORLD COULD THERE BE SO DEVOTED A SON MY LIFE IS HIS
LIFE HE IS ABSORBED IN WHAT I SAY OR DO
ONCE AGAIN HOLMES MADE A NOTE FOR SOME TIME HE SAT LOST IN THOUGHT
NO DOUBT YOU AND THE BOY WERE GREAT COMRADES BEFORE THIS SECOND
MARRIAGE YOU WERE THROWN VERY CLOSE TOGETHER WERE YOU NOT
VERY MUCH SO
AND THE BOY HAVING SO AFFECTIONATE A NATURE WAS DEVOTED NO DOUBT
TO THE MEMORY OF HIS MOTHER
MOST DEVOTED
HE WOULD CERTAINLY SEEM TO BE A MOST INTERESTING LAD THERE IS ONE
OTHER POINT ABOUT THESE ASSAULTS WERE THE STRANGE ATTACKS UPON THE
BABY AND THE ASSAULTS UPON YOUR SON AT THE SAME PERIOD
IN THE FIRST CASE IT WAS SO IT WAS AS IF SOME FRENZY HAD SEIZED
HER AND SHE HAD VENTED HER RAGE UPON BOTH IN THE SECOND CASE IT WAS
ONLY JACK WHO SUFFERED MRS MASON HAD NO COMPLAINT TO MAKE ABOUT THE
BABY
THAT CERTAINLY COMPLICATES MATTERS
I DONT QUITE FOLLOW YOU MR HOLMES
POSSIBLY NOT ONE FORMS PROVISIONAL THEORIES AND WAITS FOR TIME OR
FULLER KNOWLEDGE TO EXPLODE THEM A BAD HABIT MR FERGUSON BUT
HUMAN NATURE IS WEAK I FEAR THAT YOUR OLD FRIEND HERE HAS GIVEN AN
EXAGGERATED VIEW OF MY SCIENTIFIC METHODS HOWEVER I WILL ONLY SAY
AT THE PRESENT STAGE THAT YOUR PROBLEM DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME TO BE
INSOLUBLE AND THAT YOU MAY EXPECT TO FIND US AT VICTORIA AT TWO
OCLOCK
IT WAS EVENING OF A DULL FOGGY NOVEMBER DAY WHEN HAVING LEFT OUR
BAGS AT THE CHEQUERS LAMBERLEY WE DROVE THROUGH THE SUSSEX CLAY OF
A LONG WINDING LANE AND FINALLY REACHED THE ISOLATED AND ANCIENT
FARMHOUSE IN WHICH FERGUSON DWELT IT WAS A LARGE STRAGGLING
BUILDING VERY OLD IN THE CENTRE VERY NEW AT THE WINGS WITH TOWERING
TUDOR CHIMNEYS AND A LICHENSPOTTED HIGHPITCHED ROOF OF HORSHAM
SLABS THE DOORSTEPS WERE WORN INTO CURVES AND THE ANCIENT TILES
WHICH LINED THE PORCH WERE MARKED WITH THE REBUS OF A CHEESE AND A
MAN AFTER THE ORIGINAL BUILDER WITHIN THE CEILINGS WERE CORRUGATED
WITH HEAVY OAKEN BEAMS AND THE UNEVEN FLOORS SAGGED INTO SHARP
CURVES AN ODOUR OF AGE AND DECAY PERVADED THE WHOLE CRUMBLING
BUILDING
THERE WAS ONE VERY LARGE CENTRAL ROOM INTO WHICH FERGUSON LED US
HERE IN A HUGE OLDFASHIONED FIREPLACE WITH AN IRON SCREEN BEHIND IT
DATED THERE BLAZED AND SPLUTTERED A SPLENDID LOG FIRE
THE ROOM AS I GAZED ROUND WAS A MOST SINGULAR MIXTURE OF DATES AND
OF PLACES THE HALFPANELLED WALLS MAY WELL HAVE BELONGED TO THE
ORIGINAL YEOMAN FARMER OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THEY WERE
ORNAMENTED HOWEVER ON THE LOWER PART BY A LINE OF WELLCHOSEN
MODERN WATERCOLOURS WHILE ABOVE WHERE YELLOW PLASTER TOOK THE
PLACE OF OAK THERE WAS HUNG A FINE COLLECTION OF SOUTH AMERICAN
UTENSILS AND WEAPONS WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT NO DOUBT BY THE
PERUVIAN LADY UPSTAIRS HOLMES ROSE WITH THAT QUICK CURIOSITY WHICH
SPRANG FROM HIS EAGER MIND AND EXAMINED THEM WITH SOME CARE HE
RETURNED WITH HIS EYES FULL OF THOUGHT
HULLO HE CRIED HULLO
A SPANIEL HAD LAIN IN A BASKET IN THE CORNER IT CAME SLOWLY FORWARD
TOWARDS ITS MASTER WALKING WITH DIFFICULTY ITS HIND LEGS MOVED
IRREGULARLY AND ITS TAIL WAS ON THE GROUND IT LICKED FERGUSONS

VERY REMARKABLE VERY SUGGESTIVE

INTELLECTUAL PUZZLE TO YOU BUT IT IS LIFE AND DEATH TO ME MY WIFE A

MR HOLMES IT IS TOO TERRIBLY SERIOUS
THE BIG RUGBY THREEQUARTER WAS TREMBLING ALL OVER HOLMES PUT HIS
HAND SOOTHINGLY UPON HIS ARM
I FEAR THAT THERE IS PAIN FOR YOU MR FERGUSON WHATEVER THE
SOLUTION MAY BE SAID HE I WOULD SPARE YOU ALL I CAN I CANNOT SAY
MORE FOR THE INSTANT BUT BEFORE I LEAVE THIS HOUSE I HOPE I MAY HAVE
SOMETHING DEFINITE
PLEASE GOD YOU MAY IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME GENTLEMEN I WILL GO UP
TO MY WIFES ROOM AND SEE IF THERE HAS BEEN ANY CHANGE
HE WAS AWAY SOME MINUTES DURING WHICH HOLMES RESUMED HIS EXAMINATION
OF THE CURIOSITIES UPON THE WALL WHEN OUR HOST RETURNED IT WAS CLEAR
FROM HIS DOWNCAST FACE THAT HE HAD MADE NO PROGRESS HE BROUGHT WITH
HIM A TALL SLIM BROWNFACED GIRL
THE TEA IS READY DOLORES SAID FERGUSON SEE THAT YOUR MISTRESS
HAS EVERYTHING SHE CAN WISH
SHE VERRA ILL CRIED THE GIRL LOOKING WITH INDIGNANT EYES AT HER
MASTER SHE NO ASK FOR FOOD SHE VERRA ILL SHE NEED DOCTOR I
FRIGHTENED STAY ALONE WITH HER WITHOUT DOCTOR
FERGUSON LOOKED AT ME WITH A QUESTION IN HIS EYES
I SHOULD BE SO GLAD IF I COULD BE OF USE
WOULD YOUR MISTRESS SEE DR WATSON
I TAKE HIM I NO ASK LEAVE SHE NEEDS DOCTOR
THEN ILL COME WITH YOU AT ONCE
I FOLLOWED THE GIRL WHO WAS QUIVERING WITH STRONG EMOTION UP THE
STAIRCASE AND DOWN AN ANCIENT CORRIDOR AT THE END WAS AN
IRONCLAMPED AND MASSIVE DOOR IT STRUCK ME AS I LOOKED AT IT THAT IF
FERGUSON TRIED TO FORCE HIS WAY TO HIS WIFE HE WOULD FIND IT NO EASY
MATTER THE GIRL DREW A KEY FROM HER POCKET AND THE HEAVY OAKEN
PLANKS CREAKED UPON THEIR OLD HINGES I PASSED IN AND SHE SWIFTLY
FOLLOWED FASTENING THE DOOR BEHIND HER
ON THE BED A WOMAN WAS LYING WHO WAS CLEARLY IN A HIGH FEVER SHE
WAS ONLY HALF CONSCIOUS BUT AS I ENTERED SHE RAISED A PAIR OF
FRIGHTENED BUT BEAUTIFUL EYES AND GLARED AT ME IN APPREHENSION
SEEING A STRANGER SHE APPEARED TO BE RELIEVED AND SANK BACK WITH A
SIGH UPON THE PILLOW I STEPPED UP TO HER WITH A FEW REASSURING
WORDS AND SHE LAY STILL WHILE I TOOK HER PULSE AND TEMPERATURE BOTH
WERE HIGH AND YET MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT THE CONDITION WAS RATHER
THAT OF MENTAL AND NERVOUS EXCITEMENT THAN OF ANY ACTUAL SEIZURE
SHE LIE LIKE THAT ONE DAY TWO DAY I FRAID SHE DIE SAID THE
GIRL
THE WOMAN TURNED HER FLUSHED AND HANDSOME FACE TOWARDS ME
WHERE IS MY HUSBAND
HE IS BELOW AND WOULD WISH TO SEE YOU
I WILL NOT SEE HIM I WILL NOT SEE HIM THEN SHE SEEMED TO WANDER
OFF INTO DELIRIUM A FIEND A FIEND OH WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THIS
DEVIL
CAN I HELP YOU IN ANY WAY
NO NO ONE CAN HELP IT IS FINISHED ALL IS DESTROYED DO WHAT I
WILL ALL IS DESTROYED
THE WOMAN MUST HAVE SOME STRANGE DELUSION I COULD NOT SEE HONEST BOB
FERGUSON IN THE CHARACTER OF FIEND OR DEVIL
MADAME I SAID YOUR HUSBAND LOVES YOU DEARLY HE IS DEEPLY
GRIEVED AT THIS HAPPENING
AGAIN SHE TURNED ON ME THOSE GLORIOUS EYES
HE LOVES ME YES BUT DO I NOT LOVE HIM DO I NOT LOVE HIM EVEN TO
SACRIFICE MYSELF RATHER THAN BREAK HIS DEAR HEART THAT IS HOW I LOVE
HIM AND YET HE COULD THINK OF MEHE COULD SPEAK OF ME SO
HE IS FULL OF GRIEF BUT HE CANNOT UNDERSTAND
NO HE CANNOT UNDERSTAND BUT HE SHOULD TRUST
WILL YOU NOT SEE HIM I SUGGESTED
NO NO I CANNOT FORGET THOSE TERRIBLE WORDS NOR THE LOOK UPON HIS
FACE I WILL NOT SEE HIM GO NOW YOU CAN DO NOTHING FOR ME TELL HIM
ONLY ONE THING I WANT MY CHILD I HAVE A RIGHT TO MY CHILD THAT IS
THE ONLY MESSAGE I CAN SEND HIM SHE TURNED HER FACE TO THE WALL AND
WOULD SAY NO MORE
I RETURNED TO THE ROOM DOWNSTAIRS WHERE FERGUSON AND HOLMES STILL
SAT BY THE FIRE FERGUSON LISTENED MOODILY TO MY ACCOUNT OF THE
INTERVIEW
HOW CAN I SEND HER THE CHILD HE SAID HOW DO I KNOW WHAT STRANGE
IMPULSE MIGHT COME UPON HER HOW CAN I EVER FORGET HOW SHE ROSE FROM
BESIDE IT WITH ITS BLOOD UPON HER LIPS HE SHUDDERED AT THE
RECOLLECTION THE CHILD IS SAFE WITH MRS MASON AND THERE HE MUST
REMAIN
A SMART MAID THE ONLY MODERN THING WHICH WE HAD SEEN IN THE HOUSE
HAD BROUGHT IN SOME TEA AS SHE WAS SERVING IT THE DOOR OPENED AND A
YOUTH ENTERED THE ROOM HE WAS A REMARKABLE LAD PALEFACED AND
FAIRHAIRED WITH EXCITABLE LIGHT BLUE EYES WHICH BLAZED INTO A
SUDDEN FLAME OF EMOTION AND JOY AS THEY RESTED UPON HIS FATHER HE
RUSHED FORWARD AND THREW HIS ARMS ROUND HIS NECK WITH THE ABANDON OF
A LOVING GIRL
OH DADDY HE CRIED I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU WERE DUE YET I
SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE TO MEET YOU OH I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU
FERGUSON GENTLY DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM THE EMBRACE WITH SOME LITTLE
SHOW OF EMBARRASSMENT
DEAR OLD CHAP SAID HE PATTING THE FLAXEN HEAD WITH A VERY TENDER
HAND I CAME EARLY BECAUSE MY FRIENDS MR HOLMES AND DR WATSON
HAVE BEEN PERSUADED TO COME DOWN AND SPEND AN EVENING WITH US
IS THAT MR HOLMES THE DETECTIVE
YES
THE YOUTH LOOKED AT US WITH A VERY PENETRATING AND AS IT SEEMED TO
ME UNFRIENDLY GAZE
WHAT ABOUT YOUR OTHER CHILD MR FERGUSON ASKED HOLMES MIGHT WE
MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE BABY
ASK MRS MASON TO BRING BABY DOWN SAID FERGUSON THE BOY WENT OFF
WITH A CURIOUS SHAMBLING GAIT WHICH TOLD MY SURGICAL EYES THAT HE
WAS SUFFERING FROM A WEAK SPINE PRESENTLY HE RETURNED AND BEHIND
HIM CAME A TALL GAUNT WOMAN BEARING IN HER ARMS A VERY BEAUTIFUL
CHILD DARKEYED GOLDENHAIRED A WONDERFUL MIXTURE OF THE SAXON AND
THE LATIN FERGUSON WAS EVIDENTLY DEVOTED TO IT FOR HE TOOK IT INTO
HIS ARMS AND FONDLED IT MOST TENDERLY
FANCY ANYONE HAVING THE HEART TO HURT HIM HE MUTTERED AS HE
GLANCED DOWN AT THE SMALL ANGRY RED PUCKER UPON THE CHERUB THROAT
IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT I CHANCED TO GLANCE AT HOLMES AND SAW A
MOST SINGULAR INTENTNESS IN HIS EXPRESSION HIS FACE WAS AS SET AS IF
IT HAD BEEN CARVED OUT OF OLD IVORY AND HIS EYES WHICH HAD GLANCED
FOR A MOMENT AT FATHER AND CHILD WERE NOW FIXED WITH EAGER CURIOSITY
UPON SOMETHING AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM FOLLOWING HIS GAZE I
COULD ONLY GUESS THAT HE WAS LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE
MELANCHOLY DRIPPING GARDEN IT IS TRUE THAT A SHUTTER HAD HALF
CLOSED OUTSIDE AND OBSTRUCTED THE VIEW BUT NONE THE LESS IT WAS
CERTAINLY AT THE WINDOW THAT HOLMES WAS FIXING HIS CONCENTRATED
ATTENTION THEN HE SMILED AND HIS EYES CAME BACK TO THE BABY ON ITS
CHUBBY NECK THERE WAS THIS SMALL PUCKERED MARK WITHOUT SPEAKING
HOLMES EXAMINED IT WITH CARE FINALLY HE SHOOK ONE OF THE DIMPLED
FISTS WHICH WAVED IN FRONT OF HIM
GOODBYE LITTLE MAN YOU HAVE MADE A STRANGE START IN LIFE NURSE
I SHOULD WISH TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU IN PRIVATE
HE TOOK HER ASIDE AND SPOKE EARNESTLY FOR A FEW MINUTES I ONLY HEARD
THE LAST WORDS WHICH WERE YOUR ANXIETY WILL SOON I HOPE BE SET
AT REST THE WOMAN WHO SEEMED TO BE A SOUR SILENT KIND OF
CREATURE WITHDREW WITH THE CHILD
WHAT IS MRS MASON LIKE ASKED HOLMES
NOT VERY PREPOSSESSING EXTERNALLY AS YOU CAN SEE BUT A HEART OF
GOLD AND DEVOTED TO THE CHILD
DO YOU LIKE HER JACK HOLMES TURNED SUDDENLY UPON THE BOY HIS
EXPRESSIVE MOBILE FACE SHADOWED OVER AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
JACKY HAS VERY STRONG LIKES AND DISLIKES SAID FERGUSON PUTTING
HIS ARM ROUND THE BOY LUCKILY I AM ONE OF HIS LIKES
THE BOY COOED AND NESTLED HIS HEAD UPON HIS FATHERS BREAST FERGUSON
GENTLY DISENGAGED HIM
RUN AWAY LITTLE JACKY SAID HE AND HE WATCHED HIS SON WITH LOVING
EYES UNTIL HE DISAPPEARED NOW MR HOLMES HE CONTINUED WHEN THE
BOY WAS GONE I REALLY FEEL THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU ON A FOOLS
ERRAND FOR WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY DO SAVE GIVE ME YOUR SYMPATHY IT
MUST BE AN EXCEEDINGLY DELICATE AND COMPLEX AFFAIR FROM YOUR POINT OF
VIEW
IT IS CERTAINLY DELICATE SAID MY FRIEND WITH AN AMUSED SMILE BUT
I HAVE NOT BEEN STRUCK UP TO NOW WITH ITS COMPLEXITY IT HAS BEEN A
CASE FOR INTELLECTUAL DEDUCTION BUT WHEN THIS ORIGINAL INTELLECTUAL
DEDUCTION IS CONFIRMED POINT BY POINT BY QUITE A NUMBER OF
INDEPENDENT INCIDENTS THEN THE SUBJECTIVE BECOMES OBJECTIVE AND WE
CAN SAY CONFIDENTLY THAT WE HAVE REACHED OUR GOAL I HAD IN FACT
REACHED IT BEFORE WE LEFT BAKER STREET AND THE REST HAS MERELY BEEN
OBSERVATION AND CONFIRMATION
FERGUSON PUT HIS BIG HAND TO HIS FURROWED FOREHEAD
FOR HEAVENS SAKE HOLMES HE SAID HOARSELY IF YOU CAN SEE THE
TRUTH IN THIS MATTER DO NOT KEEP ME IN SUSPENSE HOW DO I STAND WHAT
SHALL I DO I CARE NOTHING AS TO HOW YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR FACTS
SO LONG AS YOU HAVE REALLY GOT THEM
CERTAINLY I OWE YOU AN EXPLANATION AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT BUT YOU
WILL PERMIT ME TO HANDLE THE MATTER IN MY OWN WAY IS THE LADY
CAPABLE OF SEEING US WATSON
SHE IS ILL BUT SHE IS QUITE RATIONAL
VERY GOOD IT IS ONLY IN HER PRESENCE THAT WE CAN CLEAR THE MATTER
UP LET US GO UP TO HER
SHE WILL NOT SEE ME CRIED FERGUSON
OH YES SHE WILL SAID HOLMES HE SCRIBBLED A FEW LINES UPON A
SHEET OF PAPER YOU AT LEAST HAVE THE ENTREE WATSON WILL YOU HAVE
THE GOODNESS TO GIVE THE LADY THIS NOTE
I ASCENDED AGAIN AND HANDED THE NOTE TO DOLORES WHO CAUTIOUSLY
OPENED THE DOOR A MINUTE LATER I HEARD A CRY FROM WITHIN A CRY IN
WHICH JOY AND SURPRISE SEEMED TO BE BLENDED DOLORES LOOKED OUT
SHE WILL SEE THEM SHE WILL LEESTEN SAID SHE
AT MY SUMMONS FERGUSON AND HOLMES CAME UP AS WE ENTERED THE ROOM
FERGUSON TOOK A STEP OR TWO TOWARDS HIS WIFE WHO HAD RAISED HERSELF
IN THE BED BUT SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO REPULSE HIM HE SANK INTO AN
ARMCHAIR WHILE HOLMES SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HIM AFTER BOWING TO THE
LADY WHO LOOKED AT HIM WITH WIDEEYED AMAZEMENT
I THINK WE CAN DISPENSE WITH DOLORES SAID HOLMES OH VERY WELL
MADAME IF YOU WOULD RATHER SHE STAYED I CAN SEE NO OBJECTION NOW
MR FERGUSON I AM A BUSY MAN WITH MANY CALLS AND MY METHODS HAVE TO
BE SHORT AND DIRECT THE SWIFTEST SURGERY IS THE LEAST PAINFUL LET
ME FIRST SAY WHAT WILL EASE YOUR MIND YOUR WIFE IS A VERY GOOD A
VERY LOVING AND A VERY ILLUSED WOMAN
FERGUSON SAT UP WITH A CRY OF JOY
PROVE THAT MR HOLMES AND I AM YOUR DEBTOR FOREVER
I WILL DO SO BUT IN DOING SO I MUST WOUND YOU DEEPLY IN ANOTHER
DIRECTION
I CARE NOTHING SO LONG AS YOU CLEAR MY WIFE EVERYTHING ON EARTH IS
INSIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO THAT
LET ME TELL YOU THEN THE TRAIN OF REASONING WHICH PASSED THROUGH
MY MIND IN BAKER STREET THE IDEA OF A VAMPIRE WAS TO ME ABSURD SUCH
THINGS DO NOT HAPPEN IN CRIMINAL PRACTICE IN ENGLAND AND YET YOUR
OBSERVATION WAS PRECISE YOU HAD SEEN THE LADY RISE FROM BESIDE THE
CHILDS COT WITH THE BLOOD UPON HER LIPS
I DID
DID IT NOT OCCUR TO YOU THAT A BLEEDING WOUND MAY BE SUCKED FOR SOME
OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO DRAW THE BLOOD FROM IT WAS THERE NOT A QUEEN
IN ENGLISH HISTORY WHO SUCKED SUCH A WOUND TO DRAW POISON FROM IT
POISON
A SOUTH AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD MY INSTINCT FELT THE PRESENCE OF THOSE
WEAPONS UPON THE WALL BEFORE MY EYES EVER SAW THEM IT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN OTHER POISON BUT THAT WAS WHAT OCCURRED TO ME WHEN I SAW THAT
LITTLE EMPTY QUIVER BESIDE THE SMALL BIRDBOW IT WAS JUST WHAT I
EXPECTED TO SEE IF THE CHILD WERE PRICKED WITH ONE OF THOSE ARROWS
DIPPED IN CURARE OR SOME OTHER DEVILISH DRUG IT WOULD MEAN DEATH IF
THE VENOM WERE NOT SUCKED OUT
AND THE DOG IF ONE WERE TO USE SUCH A POISON WOULD ONE NOT TRY IT
FIRST IN ORDER TO SEE THAT IT HAD NOT LOST ITS POWER I DID NOT
FORESEE THE DOG BUT AT LEAST I UNDERSTAND HIM AND HE FITTED INTO MY
RECONSTRUCTION
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR WIFE FEARED SUCH AN ATTACK SHE SAW IT
MADE AND SAVED THE CHILDS LIFE AND YET SHE SHRANK FROM TELLING YOU
ALL THE TRUTH FOR SHE KNEW HOW YOU LOVED THE BOY AND FEARED LEST IT
BREAK YOUR HEART
JACKY
I WATCHED HIM AS YOU FONDLED THE CHILD JUST NOW HIS FACE WAS
CLEARLY REFLECTED IN THE GLASS OF THE WINDOW WHERE THE SHUTTER FORMED
A BACKGROUND I SAW SUCH JEALOUSY SUCH CRUEL HATRED AS I HAVE
SELDOM SEEN IN A HUMAN FACE
MY JACKY
YOU HAVE TO FACE IT MR FERGUSON IT IS THE MORE PAINFUL BECAUSE IT
IS A DISTORTED LOVE A MANIACAL EXAGGERATED LOVE FOR YOU AND
POSSIBLY FOR HIS DEAD MOTHER WHICH HAS PROMPTED HIS ACTION HIS VERY
SOUL IS CONSUMED WITH HATRED FOR THIS SPLENDID CHILD WHOSE HEALTH
AND BEAUTY ARE A CONTRAST TO HIS OWN WEAKNESS
GOOD GOD IT IS INCREDIBLE
HAVE I SPOKEN THE TRUTH MADAME
THE LADY WAS SOBBING WITH HER FACE BURIED IN THE PILLOWS NOW SHE
TURNED TO HER HUSBAND
HOW COULD I TELL YOU BOB I FELT THE BLOW IT WOULD BE TO YOU IT
WAS BETTER THAT I SHOULD WAIT AND THAT IT SHOULD COME FROM SOME OTHER
LIPS THAN MINE WHEN THIS GENTLEMAN WHO SEEMS TO HAVE POWERS OF
MAGIC WROTE THAT HE KNEW ALL I WAS GLAD
I THINK A YEAR AT SEA WOULD BE MY PRESCRIPTION FOR MASTER JACKY
SAID HOLMES RISING FROM HIS CHAIR ONLY ONE THING IS STILL CLOUDED
MADAME WE CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND YOUR ATTACKS UPON MASTER JACKY THERE
IS A LIMIT TO A MOTHERS PATIENCE BUT HOW DID YOU DARE TO LEAVE THE
CHILD THESE LAST TWO DAYS
I HAD TOLD MRS MASON SHE KNEW
EXACTLY SO I IMAGINED
FERGUSON WAS STANDING BY THE BED CHOKING HIS HANDS OUTSTRETCHED AND
QUIVERING
THIS I FANCY IS THE TIME FOR OUR EXIT WATSON SAID HOLMES IN A
WHISPER IF YOU WILL TAKE ONE ELBOW OF THE TOO FAITHFUL DOLORES I
WILL TAKE THE OTHER THERE NOW HE ADDED AS HE CLOSED THE DOOR
BEHIND HIM I THINK WE MAY LEAVE THEM TO SETTLE THE REST AMONG
THEMSELVES
I HAVE ONLY ONE FURTHER NOTE OF THIS CASE IT IS THE LETTER WHICH
HOLMES WROTE IN FINAL ANSWER TO THAT WITH WHICH THE NARRATIVE BEGINS
IT RAN THUS
BAKER STREET
NOV ST
RE VAMPIRES
SIR
REFERRING TO YOUR LETTER OF THE TH I BEG TO STATE THAT I HAVE
LOOKED INTO THE INQUIRY OF YOUR CLIENT MR ROBERT FERGUSON OF
FERGUSON AND MUIRHEAD TEA BROKERS OF MINCING LANE AND THAT THE
MATTER HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO A SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION WITH THANKS FOR
YOUR RECOMMENDATION I AM SIR
FAITHFULLY YOURS
SHERLOCK HOLMES
THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE GARRIDEBS
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A COMEDY OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN A TRAGEDY IT COST ONE
MAN HIS REASON IT COST ME A BLOODLETTING AND IT COST YET ANOTHER
MAN THE PENALTIES OF THE LAW YET THERE WAS CERTAINLY AN ELEMENT OF
COMEDY WELL YOU SHALL JUDGE FOR YOURSELVES
I REMEMBER THE DATE VERY WELL FOR IT WAS IN THE SAME MONTH THAT
HOLMES REFUSED A KNIGHTHOOD FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY
BE DESCRIBED I ONLY REFER TO THE MATTER IN PASSING FOR IN MY
POSITION OF PARTNER AND CONFIDANT I AM OBLIGED TO BE PARTICULARLY
CAREFUL TO AVOID ANY INDISCRETION I REPEAT HOWEVER THAT THIS
ENABLES ME TO FIX THE DATE WHICH WAS THE LATTER END OF JUNE SHORTLY
AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR HOLMES HAD
SPENT SEVERAL DAYS IN BED AS WAS HIS HABIT FROM TIME TO TIME BUT HE
EMERGED THAT MORNING WITH A LONG FOOLSCAP DOCUMENT IN HIS HAND AND A
TWINKLE OF AMUSEMENT IN HIS AUSTERE GRAY EYES
THERE IS A CHANCE FOR YOU TO MAKE SOME MONEY FRIEND WATSON SAID
HE HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THE NAME OF GARRIDEB
I ADMITTED THAT I HAD NOT
WELL IF YOU CAN LAY YOUR HAND UPON A GARRIDEB THERES MONEY IN
IT
WHY
AH THATS A LONG STORYRATHER A WHIMSICAL ONE TOO I DONT THINK
IN ALL OUR EXPLORATIONS OF HUMAN COMPLEXITIES WE HAVE EVER COME UPON
ANYTHING MORE SINGULAR THE FELLOW WILL BE HERE PRESENTLY FOR
CROSSEXAMINATION SO I WONT OPEN THE MATTER UP TILL HE COMES BUT
MEANWHILE THATS THE NAME WE WANT
THE TELEPHONE DIRECTORY LAY ON THE TABLE BESIDE ME AND I TURNED OVER
THE PAGES IN A RATHER HOPELESS QUEST BUT TO MY AMAZEMENT THERE WAS
THIS STRANGE NAME IN ITS DUE PLACE I GAVE A CRY OF TRIUMPH
HERE YOU ARE HOLMES HERE IT IS
HOLMES TOOK THE BOOK FROM MY HAND
GARRIDEB N HE READ LITTLE RYDER STREET W SORRY TO
DISAPPOINT YOU MY DEAR WATSON BUT THIS IS THE MAN HIMSELF THAT IS
THE ADDRESS UPON HIS LETTER WE WANT ANOTHER TO MATCH HIM
MRS HUDSON HAD COME IN WITH A CARD UPON A TRAY I TOOK IT UP AND
GLANCED AT IT
WHY HERE IT IS I CRIED IN AMAZEMENT THIS IS A DIFFERENT
INITIAL JOHN GARRIDEB COUNSELLOR AT LAW MOORVILLE KANSAS U S
A
HOLMES SMILED AS HE LOOKED AT THE CARD I AM AFRAID YOU MUST MAKE
YET ANOTHER EFFORT WATSON SAID HE THIS GENTLEMAN IS ALSO IN THE
PLOT ALREADY THOUGH I CERTAINLY DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE HIM THIS
MORNING HOWEVER HE IS IN A POSITION TO TELL US A GOOD DEAL WHICH I
WANT TO KNOW
A MOMENT LATER HE WAS IN THE ROOM MR JOHN GARRIDEB COUNSELLOR AT
LAW WAS A SHORT POWERFUL MAN WITH THE ROUND FRESH CLEANSHAVEN
FACE CHARACTERISTIC OF SO MANY AMERICAN MEN OF AFFAIRS THE GENERAL
EFFECT WAS CHUBBY AND RATHER CHILDLIKE SO THAT ONE RECEIVED THE
IMPRESSION OF QUITE A YOUNG MAN WITH A BROAD SET SMILE UPON HIS FACE
HIS EYES HOWEVER WERE ARRESTING SELDOM IN ANY HUMAN HEAD HAVE I
SEEN A PAIR WHICH BESPOKE A MORE INTENSE INWARD LIFE SO BRIGHT WERE
THEY SO ALERT SO RESPONSIVE TO EVERY CHANGE OF THOUGHT HIS ACCENT
WAS AMERICAN BUT WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY ANY ECCENTRICITY OF SPEECH
MR HOLMES HE ASKED GLANCING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AH YES
YOUR PICTURES ARE NOT UNLIKE YOU SIR IF I MAY SAY SO I BELIEVE YOU
HAVE HAD A LETTER FROM MY NAMESAKE MR NATHAN GARRIDEB HAVE YOU
NOT
PRAY SIT DOWN SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES WE SHALL I FANCY HAVE A
GOOD DEAL TO DISCUSS HE TOOK UP HIS SHEETS OF FOOLSCAP YOU ARE
OF COURSE THE MR JOHN GARRIDEB MENTIONED IN THIS DOCUMENT BUT
SURELY YOU HAVE BEEN IN ENGLAND SOME TIME
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT MR HOLMES I SEEMED TO READ SUDDEN SUSPICION
IN THOSE EXPRESSIVE EYES
YOUR WHOLE OUTFIT IS ENGLISH
MR GARRIDEB FORCED A LAUGH IVE READ OF YOUR TRICKS MR HOLMES
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF THEM WHERE DO YOU READ
THAT
THE SHOULDER CUT OF YOUR COAT THE TOES OF YOUR BOOTSCOULD ANYONE
DOUBT IT
WELL WELL I HAD NO IDEA I WAS SO OBVIOUS A BRITISHER BUT BUSINESS
BROUGHT ME OVER HERE SOME TIME AGO AND SO AS YOU SAY MY OUTFIT IS
NEARLY ALL LONDON HOWEVER I GUESS YOUR TIME IS OF VALUE AND WE DID
NOT MEET TO TALK ABOUT THE CUT OF MY SOCKS WHAT ABOUT GETTING DOWN
TO THAT PAPER YOU HOLD IN YOUR HAND
HOLMES HAD IN SOME WAY RUFFLED OUR VISITOR WHOSE CHUBBY FACE HAD
ASSUMED A FAR LESS AMIABLE EXPRESSION
PATIENCE PATIENCE MR GARRIDEB SAID MY FRIEND IN A SOOTHING
VOICE DR WATSON WOULD TELL YOU THAT THESE LITTLE DIGRESSIONS OF
MINE SOMETIMES PROVE IN THE END TO HAVE SOME BEARING ON THE MATTER
BUT WHY DID MR NATHAN GARRIDEB NOT COME WITH YOU
WHY DID HE EVER DRAG YOU INTO IT AT ALL ASKED OUR VISITOR WITH A
SUDDEN OUTFLAME OF ANGER WHAT IN THUNDER HAD YOU TO DO WITH IT
HERE WAS A BIT OF PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS BETWEEN TWO GENTLEMEN AND
ONE OF THEM MUST NEEDS CALL IN A DETECTIVE I SAW HIM THIS MORNING
AND HE TOLD ME THIS FOOLTRICK HE HAD PLAYED ME AND THATS WHY I AM
HERE BUT I FEEL BAD ABOUT IT ALL THE SAME
THERE WAS NO REFLECTION UPON YOU MR GARRIDEB IT WAS SIMPLY ZEAL
UPON HIS PART TO GAIN YOUR ENDAN END WHICH IS I UNDERSTAND
EQUALLY VITAL FOR BOTH OF YOU HE KNEW THAT I HAD MEANS OF GETTING
INFORMATION AND THEREFORE IT WAS VERY NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD APPLY
TO ME
OUR VISITORS ANGRY FACE GRADUALLY CLEARED
WELL THAT PUTS IT DIFFERENT SAID HE WHEN I WENT TO SEE HIM THIS
MORNING AND HE TOLD ME HE HAD SENT TO A DETECTIVE I JUST ASKED FOR
YOUR ADDRESS AND CAME RIGHT AWAY I DONT WANT POLICE BUTTING INTO A
PRIVATE MATTER BUT IF YOU ARE CONTENT JUST TO HELP US FIND THE MAN
THERE CAN BE NO HARM IN THAT
WELL THAT IS JUST HOW IT STANDS SAID HOLMES AND NOW SIR SINCE
YOU ARE HERE WE HAD BEST HAVE A CLEAR ACCOUNT FROM YOUR OWN LIPS MY
FRIEND HERE KNOWS NOTHING OF THE DETAILS
MR GARRIDEB SURVEYED ME WITH NOT TOO FRIENDLY A GAZE
NEED HE KNOW HE ASKED
WE USUALLY WORK TOGETHER
WELL THERES NO REASON IT SHOULD BE KEPT A SECRET ILL GIVE YOU
THE FACTS AS SHORT AS I CAN MAKE THEM IF YOU CAME FROM KANSAS I
WOULD NOT NEED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHO ALEXANDER HAMILTON GARRIDEB WAS
HE MADE HIS MONEY IN REAL ESTATE AND AFTERWARDS IN THE WHEAT PIT AT
CHICAGO BUT HE SPENT IT IN BUYING UP AS MUCH LAND AS WOULD MAKE ONE
OF YOUR COUNTIES LYING ALONG THE ARKANSAS RIVER WEST OF FORT DODGE
ITS GRAZINGLAND AND LUMBERLAND AND ARABLELAND AND
MINERALIZEDLAND AND JUST EVERY SORT OF LAND THAT BRINGS DOLLARS TO
THE MAN THAT OWNS IT
HE HAD NO KITH NOR KINOR IF HE HAD I NEVER HEARD OF IT BUT HE
TOOK A KIND OF PRIDE IN THE QUEERNESS OF HIS NAME THAT WAS WHAT
BROUGHT US TOGETHER I WAS IN THE LAW AT TOPEKA AND ONE DAY I HAD A
VISIT FROM THE OLD MAN AND HE WAS TICKLED TO DEATH TO MEET ANOTHER
MAN WITH HIS OWN NAME IT WAS HIS PET FAD AND HE WAS DEAD SET TO
FIND OUT IF THERE WERE ANY MORE GARRIDEBS IN THE WORLD FIND ME
ANOTHER SAID HE I TOLD HIM I WAS A BUSY MAN AND COULD NOT SPEND MY
LIFE HIKING ROUND THE WORLD IN SEARCH OF GARRIDEBS NONE THE LESS
SAID HE THAT IS JUST WHAT YOU WILL DO IF THINGS PAN OUT AS I
PLANNED THEM I THOUGHT HE WAS JOKING BUT THERE WAS A POWERFUL LOT
OF MEANING IN THE WORDS AS I WAS SOON TO DISCOVER
FOR HE DIED WITHIN A YEAR OF SAYING THEM AND HE LEFT A WILL BEHIND
HIM IT WAS THE QUEEREST WILL THAT HAS EVER BEEN FILED IN THE STATE
OF KANSAS HIS PROPERTY WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS AND I WAS TO
HAVE ONE ON CONDITION THAT I FOUND TWO GARRIDEBS WHO WOULD SHARE THE
REMAINDER ITS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR EACH IF IT IS A CENT BUT WE
CANT LAY A FINGER ON IT UNTIL WE ALL THREE STAND IN A ROW
IT WAS SO BIG A CHANCE THAT I JUST LET MY LEGAL PRACTICE SLIDE AND I
SET FORTH LOOKING FOR GARRIDEBS THERE IS NOT ONE IN THE UNITED
STATES I WENT THROUGH IT SIR WITH A FINETOOTHED COMB AND NEVER A
GARRIDEB COULD I CATCH THEN I TRIED THE OLD COUNTRY SURE ENOUGH
THERE WAS THE NAME IN THE LONDON TELEPHONE DIRECTORY I WENT AFTER
HIM TWO DAYS AGO AND EXPLAINED THE WHOLE MATTER TO HIM BUT HE IS A
LONE MAN LIKE MYSELF WITH SOME WOMEN RELATIONS BUT NO MEN IT SAYS
THREE ADULT MEN IN THE WILL SO YOU SEE WE STILL HAVE A VACANCY AND
IF YOU CAN HELP TO FILL IT WE WILL BE VERY READY TO PAY YOUR
CHARGES
WELL WATSON SAID HOLMES WITH A SMILE I SAID IT WAS RATHER
WHIMSICAL DID I NOT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT SIR THAT YOUR OBVIOUS
WAY WAS TO ADVERTISE IN THE AGONY COLUMNS OF THE PAPERS
I HAVE DONE THAT MR HOLMES NO REPLIES
DEAR ME WELL IT IS CERTAINLY A MOST CURIOUS LITTLE PROBLEM I MAY
TAKE A GLANCE AT IT IN MY LEISURE BY THE WAY IT IS CURIOUS THAT YOU
SHOULD HAVE COME FROM TOPEKA I USED TO HAVE A CORRESPONDENTHE IS
DEAD NOWOLD DR LYSANDER STARR WHO WAS MAYOR IN GOOD OLD DR STARR SAID
OUR VISITOR HIS NAME IS STILL HONOURED
WELL MR HOLMES I SUPPOSE ALL WE CAN DO IS TO REPORT TO YOU AND LET
YOU KNOW HOW WE PROGRESS I RECKON YOU WILL HEAR WITHIN A DAY OR
TWO WITH THIS ASSURANCE OUR AMERICAN BOWED AND DEPARTED
HOLMES HAD LIT HIS PIPE AND HE SAT FOR SOME TIME WITH A CURIOUS
SMILE UPON HIS FACE
WELL I ASKED AT LAST
I AM WONDERING WATSONJUST WONDERING
AT WHAT
HOLMES TOOK HIS PIPE FROM HIS LIPS
I WAS WONDERING WATSON WHAT ON EARTH COULD BE THE OBJECT OF THIS
MAN IN TELLING US SUCH A RIGMAROLE OF LIES I NEARLY ASKED HIM
SOFOR THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A BRUTAL FRONTAL ATTACK IS THE BEST
POLICYBUT I JUDGED IT BETTER TO LET HIM THINK HE HAD FOOLED US
HERE IS A MAN WITH AN ENGLISH COAT FRAYED AT THE ELBOW AND TROUSERS
BAGGED AT THE KNEE WITH A YEARS WEAR AND YET BY THIS DOCUMENT AND
BY HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE IS A PROVINCIAL AMERICAN LATELY LANDED IN
LONDON THERE HAVE BEEN NO ADVERTISEMENTS IN THE AGONY COLUMNS YOU
KNOW THAT I MISS NOTHING THERE THEY ARE MY FAVOURITE COVERT FOR
PUTTING UP A BIRD AND I WOULD NEVER HAVE OVERLOOKED SUCH A COCK
PHEASANT AS THAT I NEVER KNEW A DR LYSANDER STARR OF TOPEKA TOUCH
HIM WHERE YOU WOULD HE WAS FALSE I THINK THE FELLOW IS REALLY AN
AMERICAN BUT HE HAS WORN HIS ACCENT SMOOTH WITH YEARS OF LONDON
WHAT IS HIS GAME THEN AND WHAT MOTIVE LIES BEHIND THIS PREPOSTEROUS
SEARCH FOR GARRIDEBS ITS WORTH OUR ATTENTION FOR GRANTING THAT
THE MAN IS A RASCAL HE IS CERTAINLY A COMPLEX AND INGENIOUS ONE WE
MUST NOW FIND OUT IF OUR OTHER CORRESPONDENT IS A FRAUD ALSO JUST
RING HIM UP WATSON
I DID SO AND HEARD A THIN QUAVERING VOICE AT THE OTHER END OF THE
LINE
YES YES I AM MR NATHAN GARRIDEB IS MR HOLMES THERE I SHOULD
VERY MUCH LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH MR HOLMES
MY FRIEND TOOK THE INSTRUMENT AND I HEARD THE USUAL SYNCOPATED
DIALOGUE
YES HE HAS BEEN HERE I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DONT KNOW HIM HOW
LONG ONLY TWO DAYS YES YES OF COURSE IT IS A MOST
CAPTIVATING PROSPECT WILL YOU BE AT HOME THIS EVENING I SUPPOSE
YOUR NAMESAKE WILL NOT BE THERE VERY GOOD WE WILL COME THEN
FOR I WOULD RATHER HAVE A CHAT WITHOUT HIM DR WATSON WILL COME
WITH ME I UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR NOTE THAT YOU DID NOT GO OUT
OFTEN WELL WE SHALL BE ROUND ABOUT SIX YOU NEED NOT MENTION IT
TO THE AMERICAN LAWYER VERY GOOD GOODBYE
IT WAS TWILIGHT OF A LOVELY SPRING EVENING AND EVEN LITTLE RYDER
STREET ONE OF THE SMALLER OFFSHOOTS FROM THE EDGWARE ROAD WITHIN A
STONECAST OF OLD TYBURN TREE OF EVIL MEMORY LOOKED GOLDEN AND
WONDERFUL IN THE SLANTING RAYS OF THE SETTING SUN THE PARTICULAR
HOUSE TO WHICH WE WERE DIRECTED WAS A LARGE OLDFASHIONED EARLY
GEORGIAN EDIFICE WITH A FLAT BRICK FACE BROKEN ONLY BY TWO DEEP BAY
WINDOWS ON THE GROUND FLOOR IT WAS ON THIS GROUND FLOOR THAT OUR
CLIENT LIVED AND INDEED THE LOW WINDOWS PROVED TO BE THE FRONT OF
THE HUGE ROOM IN WHICH HE SPENT HIS WAKING HOURS HOLMES POINTED AS
WE PASSED TO THE SMALL BRASS PLATE WHICH BORE THE CURIOUS NAME
UP SOME YEARS WATSON HE REMARKED INDICATING ITS DISCOLOURED
SURFACE ITS HIS REAL NAME ANYHOW AND THAT IS SOMETHING TO NOTE
THE HOUSE HAD A COMMON STAIR AND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF NAMES
PAINTED IN THE HALL SOME INDICATING OFFICES AND SOME PRIVATE
CHAMBERS IT WAS NOT A COLLECTION OF RESIDENTIAL FLATS BUT RATHER
THE ABODE OF BOHEMIAN BACHELORS OUR CLIENT OPENED THE DOOR FOR US
HIMSELF AND APOLOGIZED BY SAYING THAT THE WOMAN IN CHARGE LEFT AT
FOUR OCLOCK MR NATHAN GARRIDEB PROVED TO BE A VERY TALL
LOOSEJOINTED ROUNDBACKED PERSON GAUNT AND BALD SOME SIXTYODD
YEARS OF AGE HE HAD A CADAVEROUS FACE WITH THE DULL DEAD SKIN OF A
MAN TO WHOM EXERCISE WAS UNKNOWN LARGE ROUND SPECTACLES AND A SMALL
PROJECTING GOATS BEARD COMBINED WITH HIS STOOPING ATTITUDE TO GIVE
HIM AN EXPRESSION OF PEERING CURIOSITY THE GENERAL EFFECT HOWEVER
WAS AMIABLE THOUGH ECCENTRIC
THE ROOM WAS AS CURIOUS AS ITS OCCUPANT IT LOOKED LIKE A SMALL
MUSEUM IT WAS BOTH BROAD AND DEEP WITH CUPBOARDS AND CABINETS ALL
ROUND CROWDED WITH SPECIMENS GEOLOGICAL AND ANATOMICAL CASES OF
BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS FLANKED EACH SIDE OF THE ENTRANCE A LARGE
TABLE IN THE CENTRE WAS LITTERED WITH ALL SORTS OF DEBRIS WHILE THE
TALL BRASS TUBE OF A POWERFUL MICROSCOPE BRISTLED UP AMONG THEM AS I
GLANCED ROUND I WAS SURPRISED AT THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE MANS
INTERESTS HERE WAS A CASE OF ANCIENT COINS THERE WAS A CABINET OF
FLINT INSTRUMENTS BEHIND HIS CENTRAL TABLE WAS A LARGE CUPBOARD OF
FOSSIL BONES ABOVE WAS A LINE OF PLASTER SKULLS WITH SUCH NAMES AS
NEANDERTHAL HEIDELBERG CROMAGNON PRINTED BENEATH THEM IT
WAS CLEAR THAT HE WAS A STUDENT OF MANY SUBJECTS AS HE STOOD IN
FRONT OF US NOW HE HELD A PIECE OF CHAMOIS LEATHER IN HIS RIGHT HAND
WITH WHICH HE WAS POLISHING A COIN
SYRACUSANOF THE BEST PERIOD HE EXPLAINED HOLDING IT UP THEY
DEGENERATED GREATLY TOWARDS THE END AT THEIR BEST I HOLD THEM
SUPREME THOUGH SOME PREFER THE ALEXANDRIAN SCHOOL YOU WILL FIND A
CHAIR HERE MR HOLMES PRAY ALLOW ME TO CLEAR THESE BONES AND YOU
SIRAH YES DR WATSONIF YOU WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO PUT THE
JAPANESE VASE TO ONE SIDE YOU SEE ROUND ME MY LITTLE INTERESTS IN
LIFE MY DOCTOR LECTURES ME ABOUT NEVER GOING OUT BUT WHY SHOULD I
GO OUT WHEN I HAVE SO MUCH TO HOLD ME HERE I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE
ADEQUATE CATALOGUING OF ONE OF THOSE CABINETS WOULD TAKE ME THREE
GOOD MONTHS
HOLMES LOOKED ROUND HIM WITH CURIOSITY
BUT DO YOU TELL ME THAT YOU NEVER GO OUT HE SAID
NOW AND AGAIN I DRIVE DOWN TO SOTHEBYS OR CHRISTIES OTHERWISE I
VERY SELDOM LEAVE MY ROOM I AM NOT TOO STRONG AND MY RESEARCHES ARE
VERY ABSORBING BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE MR HOLMES WHAT A TERRIFIC
SHOCKPLEASANT BUT TERRIFICIT WAS FOR ME WHEN I HEARD OF THIS
UNPARALLELED GOOD FORTUNE IT ONLY NEEDS ONE MORE GARRIDEB TO
COMPLETE THE MATTER AND SURELY WE CAN FIND ONE I HAD A BROTHER BUT
HE IS DEAD AND FEMALE RELATIVES ARE DISQUALIFIED BUT THERE MUST
SURELY BE OTHERS IN THE WORLD I HAD HEARD THAT YOU HANDLED STRANGE
CASES AND THAT WAS WHY I SENT TO YOU OF COURSE THIS AMERICAN
GENTLEMAN IS QUITE RIGHT AND I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIS ADVICE FIRST
BUT I ACTED FOR THE BEST
I THINK YOU ACTED VERY WISELY INDEED SAID HOLMES BUT ARE YOU
REALLY ANXIOUS TO ACQUIRE AN ESTATE IN AMERICA
CERTAINLY NOT SIR NOTHING WOULD INDUCE ME TO LEAVE MY COLLECTION
BUT THIS GENTLEMAN HAS ASSURED ME THAT HE WILL BUY ME OUT AS SOON AS
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED OUR CLAIM FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WAS THE SUM
NAMED THERE ARE A DOZEN SPECIMENS IN THE MARKET AT THE PRESENT
MOMENT WHICH FILL GAPS IN MY COLLECTION AND WHICH I AM UNABLE TO
PURCHASE FOR WANT OF A FEW HUNDRED POUNDS JUST THINK WHAT I COULD DO
WITH FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHY I HAVE THE NUCLEUS OF A NATIONAL
COLLECTION I SHALL BE THE HANS SLOANE OF MY AGE
HIS EYES GLEAMED BEHIND HIS GREAT SPECTACLES IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT
NO PAINS WOULD BE SPARED BY MR NATHAN GARRIDEB IN FINDING A
NAMESAKE
I MERELY CALLED TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE AND THERE IS NO REASON
WHY I SHOULD INTERRUPT YOUR STUDIES SAID HOLMES I PREFER TO
ESTABLISH PERSONAL TOUCH WITH THOSE WITH WHOM I DO BUSINESS THERE
ARE FEW QUESTIONS I NEED ASK FOR I HAVE YOUR VERY CLEAR NARRATIVE IN
MY POCKET AND I FILLED UP THE BLANKS WHEN THIS AMERICAN GENTLEMAN
CALLED I UNDERSTAND THAT UP TO THIS WEEK YOU WERE UNAWARE OF HIS
EXISTENCE
THAT IS SO HE CALLED LAST TUESDAY
DID HE TELL YOU OF OUR INTERVIEW TODAY
YES HE CAME STRAIGHT BACK TO ME HE HAD BEEN VERY ANGRY
WHY SHOULD HE BE ANGRY
HE SEEMED TO THINK IT WAS SOME REFLECTION ON HIS HONOUR BUT HE WAS
QUITE CHEERFUL AGAIN WHEN HE RETURNED
DID HE SUGGEST ANY COURSE OF ACTION
NO SIR HE DID NOT
HAS HE HAD OR ASKED FOR ANY MONEY FROM YOU
NO SIR NEVER
YOU SEE NO POSSIBLE OBJECT HE HAS IN VIEW
NONE EXCEPT WHAT HE STATES
DID YOU TELL HIM OF OUR TELEPHONE APPOINTMENT
YES SIR I DID
HOLMES WAS LOST IN THOUGHT I COULD SEE THAT HE WAS PUZZLED
HAVE YOU ANY ARTICLES OF GREAT VALUE IN YOUR COLLECTION
NO SIR I AM NOT A RICH MAN IT IS A GOOD COLLECTION BUT NOT A
VERY VALUABLE ONE
YOU HAVE NO FEAR OF BURGLARS
NOT THE LEAST
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THESE ROOMS
NEARLY FIVE YEARS
HOLMESS CROSSEXAMINATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY AN IMPERATIVE KNOCKING
AT THE DOOR NO SOONER HAD OUR CLIENT UNLATCHED IT THAN THE AMERICAN
LAWYER BURST EXCITEDLY INTO THE ROOM

SHOULD BE IN TIME TO GET YOU MR NATHAN GARRIDEB MY
CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE A RICH MAN SIR OUR BUSINESS IS HAPPILY
FINISHED AND ALL IS WELL AS TO YOU MR HOLMES WE CAN ONLY SAY WE

BELIEVE WHAT I TELL HIM BUT YOU ARE A BRITISHER WITH SOLID
REFERENCES AND HE IS BOUND TO TAKE NOTICE OF WHAT YOU SAY I WOULD

THE MATTER AND GET AN AFFIDAVIT OF HIS EXISTENCE BY THE LORD HE
ADDED HOTLY CONSIDERING IVE COME ALL THE WAY FROM THE CENTRE OF
AMERICA IT IS SURELY LITTLE ENOUGH IF YOU GO A HUNDRED MILES IN
ORDER TO PUT THIS MATTER THROUGH
QUITE SO SAID HOLMES I THINK WHAT THIS GENTLEMAN SAYS IS VERY
TRUE
MR NATHAN GARRIDEB SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WITH A DISCONSOLATE AIR
WELL IF YOU INSIST I SHALL GO SAID HE IT IS CERTAINLY HARD FOR
ME TO REFUSE YOU ANYTHING CONSIDERING THE GLORY OF HOPE THAT YOU
HAVE BROUGHT INTO MY LIFE

HAVE A REPORT AS SOON AS YOU CAN
ILL SEE TO THAT SAID THE AMERICAN WELL HE ADDED LOOKING AT
HIS WATCH ILL HAVE TO GET ON ILL CALL TOMORROW MR NATHAN AND
SEE YOU OFF TO BIRMINGHAM COMING MY WAY MR HOLMES WELL THEN
GOODBYE AND WE MAY HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU TOMORROW NIGHT
I NOTICED THAT MY FRIENDS FACE CLEARED WHEN THE AMERICAN LEFT THE
ROOM AND THE LOOK OF THOUGHTFUL PERPLEXITY HAD VANISHED
I WISH I COULD LOOK OVER YOUR COLLECTION MR GARRIDEB SAID HE
IN MY PROFESSION ALL SORTS OF ODD KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL AND THIS
ROOM OF YOURS IS A STOREHOUSE OF IT
OUR CLIENT SHONE WITH PLEASURE AND HIS EYES GLEAMED FROM BEHIND HIS
BIG GLASSES
I HAD ALWAYS HEARD SIR THAT YOU WERE A VERY INTELLIGENT MAN SAID
HE I COULD TAKE YOU ROUND NOW IF YOU HAVE THE TIME
UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NOT BUT THESE SPECIMENS ARE SO WELL LABELLED
AND CLASSIFIED THAT THEY HARDLY NEED YOUR PERSONAL EXPLANATION IF I
SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK IN TOMORROW I PRESUME THAT THERE WOULD BE NO
OBJECTION TO MY GLANCING OVER THEM
NONE AT ALL YOU ARE MOST WELCOME THE PLACE WILL OF COURSE BE
SHUT UP BUT MRS SAUNDERS IS IN THE BASEMENT UP TO FOUR OCLOCK AND
WOULD LET YOU IN WITH HER KEY
WELL I HAPPEN TO BE CLEAR TOMORROW AFTERNOON IF YOU WOULD SAY A
WORD TO MRS SAUNDERS IT WOULD BE QUITE IN ORDER BY THE WAY WHO IS
YOUR HOUSEAGENT
OUR CLIENT WAS AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN QUESTION
HOLLOWAY AND STEELE IN THE EDGWARE ROAD BUT WHY
I AM A BIT OF AN ARCHAEOLOGIST MYSELF WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSES SAID
HOLMES LAUGHING I WAS WONDERING IF THIS WAS QUEEN ANNE OR
GEORGIAN
GEORGIAN BEYOND DOUBT
REALLY I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT A LITTLE EARLIER HOWEVER IT IS
EASILY ASCERTAINED WELL GOODBYE MR GARRIDEB AND MAY YOU HAVE
EVERY SUCCESS IN YOUR BIRMINGHAM JOURNEY
THE HOUSEAGENTS WAS CLOSE BY BUT WE FOUND THAT IT WAS CLOSED FOR
THE DAY SO WE MADE OUR WAY BACK TO BAKER STREET IT WAS NOT TILL
AFTER DINNER THAT HOLMES REVERTED TO THE SUBJECT
OUR LITTLE PROBLEM DRAWS TO A CLOSE SAID HE NO DOUBT YOU HAVE
OUTLINED THE SOLUTION IN YOUR OWN MIND
I CAN MAKE NEITHER HEAD NOR TAIL OF IT
THE HEAD IS SURELY CLEAR ENOUGH AND THE TAIL WE SHOULD SEE
TOMORROW DID YOU NOTICE NOTHING CURIOUS ABOUT THAT ADVERTISEMENT
I SAW THAT THE WORD PLOUGH WAS MISSPELT
OH YOU DID NOTICE THAT DID YOU COME WATSON YOU IMPROVE ALL THE
TIME YES IT WAS BAD ENGLISH BUT GOOD AMERICAN THE PRINTER HAD SET
IT UP AS RECEIVED THEN THE BUCKBOARDS THAT IS AMERICAN ALSO AND
ARTESIAN WELLS ARE COMMONER WITH THEM THAN WITH US IT WAS A TYPICAL
AMERICAN ADVERTISEMENT BUT PURPORTING TO BE FROM AN ENGLISH FIRM
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT
I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE THAT THIS AMERICAN LAWYER PUT IT IN HIMSELF WHAT
HIS OBJECT WAS I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
WELL THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS ANYHOW HE WANTED TO GET
THIS GOOD OLD FOSSIL UP TO BIRMINGHAM THAT IS VERY CLEAR I MIGHT
HAVE TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS CLEARLY GOING ON A WILDGOOSE CHASE BUT
ON SECOND THOUGHTS IT SEEMED BETTER TO CLEAR THE STAGE BY LETTING
HIM GO TOMORROW WATSONWELL TOMORROW WILL SPEAK FOR ITSELF
HOLMES WAS UP AND OUT EARLY WHEN HE RETURNED AT LUNCHTIME I NOTICED
THAT HIS FACE WAS VERY GRAVE
THIS IS A MORE SERIOUS MATTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED WATSON SAID HE
IT IS FAIR TO TELL YOU SO THOUGH I KNOW IT WILL ONLY BE AN
ADDITIONAL REASON TO YOU FOR RUNNING YOUR HEAD INTO DANGER I SHOULD
KNOW MY WATSON BY NOW BUT THERE IS DANGER AND YOU SHOULD KNOW IT
WELL IT IS NOT THE FIRST WE HAVE SHARED HOLMES I HOPE IT MAY NOT
BE THE LAST WHAT IS THE PARTICULAR DANGER THIS TIME
WE ARE UP AGAINST A VERY HARD CASE I HAVE IDENTIFIED MR JOHN
GARRIDEB COUNSELLOR AT LAW HE IS NONE OTHER THAN KILLER EVANS OF
SINISTER AND MURDEROUS REPUTATION
I FEAR I AM NONE THE WISER
AH IT IS NOT PART OF YOUR PROFESSION TO CARRY ABOUT A PORTABLE
NEWGATE CALENDAR IN YOUR MEMORY I HAVE BEEN DOWN TO SEE FRIEND
LESTRADE AT THE YARD THERE MAY BE AN OCCASIONAL WANT OF IMAGINATIVE
INTUITION DOWN THERE BUT THEY LEAD THE WORLD FOR THOROUGHNESS AND
METHOD I HAD AN IDEA THAT WE MIGHT GET ON THE TRACK OF OUR AMERICAN
FRIEND IN THEIR RECORDS SURE ENOUGH I FOUND HIS CHUBBY FACE SMILING
UP AT ME FROM THE ROGUES PORTRAIT GALLERY JAMES WINTER ALIAS
MORECROFT ALIAS KILLER EVANS WAS THE INSCRIPTION BELOW HOLMES
DREW AN ENVELOPE FROM HIS POCKET I SCRIBBLED DOWN A FEW POINTS FROM
HIS DOSSIER AGED FORTYFOUR NATIVE OF CHICAGO KNOWN TO HAVE SHOT
THREE MEN IN THE STATES ESCAPED FROM PENITENTIARY THROUGH POLITICAL
INFLUENCE CAME TO LONDON IN SHOT A MAN OVER CARDS IN A
NIGHTCLUB IN THE WATERLOO ROAD IN JANUARY MAN DIED BUT HE
WAS SHOWN TO HAVE BEEN THE AGGRESSOR IN THE ROW DEAD MAN WAS
IDENTIFIED AS RODGER PRESCOTT FAMOUS AS FORGER AND COINER IN
CHICAGO KILLER EVANS RELEASED IN HAS BEEN UNDER POLICE
SUPERVISION SINCE BUT SO FAR AS KNOWN HAS LED AN HONEST LIFE VERY
DANGEROUS MAN USUALLY CARRIES ARMS AND IS PREPARED TO USE THEM THAT
IS OUR BIRD WATSONA SPORTING BIRD AS YOU MUST ADMIT
BUT WHAT IS HIS GAME
WELL IT BEGINS TO DEFINE ITSELF I HAVE BEEN TO THE HOUSEAGENTS
OUR CLIENT AS HE TOLD US HAS BEEN THERE FIVE YEARS IT WAS UNLET
FOR A YEAR BEFORE THEN THE PREVIOUS TENANT WAS A GENTLEMAN AT LARGE
NAMED WALDRON WALDRONS APPEARANCE WAS WELL REMEMBERED AT THE
OFFICE HE HAD SUDDENLY VANISHED AND NOTHING MORE BEEN HEARD OF HIM
HE WAS A TALL BEARDED MAN WITH VERY DARK FEATURES NOW PRESCOTT
THE MAN WHOM KILLER EVANS HAD SHOT WAS ACCORDING TO SCOTLAND YARD
A TALL DARK MAN WITH A BEARD AS A WORKING HYPOTHESIS I THINK WE
MAY TAKE IT THAT PRESCOTT THE AMERICAN CRIMINAL USED TO LIVE IN THE
VERY ROOM WHICH OUR INNOCENT FRIEND NOW DEVOTES TO HIS MUSEUM SO AT
LAST WE GET A LINK YOU SEE
AND THE NEXT LINK
WELL WE MUST GO NOW AND LOOK FOR THAT
HE TOOK A REVOLVER FROM THE DRAWER AND HANDED IT TO ME
I HAVE MY OLD FAVOURITE WITH ME IF OUR WILD WEST FRIEND TRIES TO
LIVE UP TO HIS NICKNAME WE MUST BE READY FOR HIM ILL GIVE YOU AN
HOUR FOR A SIESTA WATSON AND THEN I THINK IT WILL BE TIME FOR OUR
RYDER STREET ADVENTURE
IT WAS JUST FOUR OCLOCK WHEN WE REACHED THE CURIOUS APARTMENT OF
NATHAN GARRIDEB MRS SAUNDERS THE CARETAKER WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE
BUT SHE HAD NO HESITATION IN ADMITTING US FOR THE DOOR SHUT WITH A
SPRING LOCK AND HOLMES PROMISED TO SEE THAT ALL WAS SAFE BEFORE WE
LEFT SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE OUTER DOOR CLOSED HER BONNET PASSED THE
BOW WINDOW AND WE KNEW THAT WE WERE ALONE IN THE LOWER FLOOR OF THE
HOUSE HOLMES MADE A RAPID EXAMINATION OF THE PREMISES THERE WAS ONE
CUPBOARD IN A DARK CORNER WHICH STOOD OUT A LITTLE FROM THE WALL IT
WAS BEHIND THIS THAT WE EVENTUALLY CROUCHED WHILE HOLMES IN A WHISPER
OUTLINED HIS INTENTIONS
HE WANTED TO GET OUR AMIABLE FRIEND OUT OF HIS ROOMTHAT IS VERY
CLEAR AND AS THE COLLECTOR NEVER WENT OUT IT TOOK SOME PLANNING TO
DO IT THE WHOLE OF THIS GARRIDEB INVENTION WAS APPARENTLY FOR NO
OTHER END I MUST SAY WATSON THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN DEVILISH
INGENUITY ABOUT IT EVEN IF THE QUEER NAME OF THE TENANT DID GIVE HIM
AN OPENING WHICH HE COULD HARDLY HAVE EXPECTED HE WOVE HIS PLOT WITH
REMARKABLE CUNNING
BUT WHAT DID HE WANT
WELL THAT IS WHAT WE ARE HERE TO FIND OUT IT HAS NOTHING WHATEVER
TO DO WITH OUR CLIENT SO FAR AS I CAN READ THE SITUATION IT IS
SOMETHING CONNECTED WITH THE MAN HE MURDEREDTHE MAN WHO MAY HAVE
BEEN HIS CONFEDERATE IN CRIME THERE IS SOME GUILTY SECRET IN THE
ROOM THAT IS HOW I READ IT AT FIRST I THOUGHT OUR FRIEND MIGHT HAVE
SOMETHING IN HIS COLLECTION MORE VALUABLE THAN HE KNEWSOMETHING
WORTH THE ATTENTION OF A BIG CRIMINAL BUT THE FACT THAT RODGER
PRESCOTT OF EVIL MEMORY INHABITED THESE ROOMS POINTS TO SOME DEEPER
REASON WELL WATSON WE CAN BUT POSSESS OUR SOULS IN PATIENCE AND
SEE WHAT THE HOUR MAY BRING
THAT HOUR WAS NOT LONG IN STRIKING WE CROUCHED CLOSER IN THE SHADOW
AS WE HEARD THE OUTER DOOR OPEN AND SHUT THEN CAME THE SHARP
METALLIC SNAP OF A KEY AND THE AMERICAN WAS IN THE ROOM HE CLOSED
THE DOOR SOFTLY BEHIND HIM TOOK A SHARP GLANCE AROUND HIM TO SEE
THAT ALL WAS SAFE THREW OFF HIS OVERCOAT AND WALKED UP TO THE
CENTRAL TABLE WITH THE BRISK MANNER OF ONE WHO KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT HE
HAS TO DO AND HOW TO DO IT HE PUSHED THE TABLE TO ONE SIDE TORE UP
THE SQUARE OF CARPET ON WHICH IT RESTED ROLLED IT COMPLETELY BACK
AND THEN DRAWING A JEMMY FROM HIS INSIDE POCKET HE KNELT DOWN AND
WORKED VIGOROUSLY UPON THE FLOOR PRESENTLY WE HEARD THE SOUND OF
SLIDING BOARDS AND AN INSTANT LATER A SQUARE HAD OPENED IN THE
PLANKS KILLER EVANS STRUCK A MATCH LIT A STUMP OF CANDLE AND
VANISHED FROM OUR VIEW
CLEARLY OUR MOMENT HAD COME HOLMES TOUCHED MY WRIST AS A SIGNAL AND
TOGETHER WE STOLE ACROSS TO THE OPEN TRAPDOOR GENTLY AS WE MOVED
HOWEVER THE OLD FLOOR MUST HAVE CREAKED UNDER OUR FEET FOR THE HEAD
OF OUR AMERICAN PEERING ANXIOUSLY ROUND EMERGED SUDDENLY FROM THE
OPEN SPACE HIS FACE TURNED UPON US WITH A GLARE OF BAFFLED RAGE
WHICH GRADUALLY SOFTENED INTO A RATHER SHAMEFACED GRIN AS HE REALIZED
THAT TWO PISTOLS WERE POINTED AT HIS HEAD
WELL WELL SAID HE COOLLY AS HE SCRAMBLED TO THE SURFACE I GUESS
YOU HAVE BEEN ONE TOO MANY FOR ME MR HOLMES SAW THROUGH MY GAME I
SUPPOSE AND PLAYED ME FOR A SUCKER FROM THE FIRST WELL SIR I HAND
IT TO YOU YOU HAVE ME BEAT AND
IN AN INSTANT HE HAD WHISKED OUT A REVOLVER FROM HIS BREAST AND HAD
FIRED TWO SHOTS I FELT A SUDDEN HOT SEAR AS IF A REDHOT IRON HAD
BEEN PRESSED TO MY THIGH THERE WAS A CRASH AS HOLMESS PISTOL CAME
DOWN ON THE MANS HEAD I HAD A VISION OF HIM SPRAWLING UPON THE
FLOOR WITH BLOOD RUNNING DOWN HIS FACE WHILE HOLMES RUMMAGED HIM FOR
WEAPONS THEN MY FRIENDS WIRY ARMS WERE ROUND ME AND HE WAS LEADING
ME TO A CHAIR
YOURE NOT HURT WATSON FOR GODS SAKE SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT HURT
IT WAS WORTH A WOUNDIT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDSTO KNOW THE DEPTH OF
LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK THE CLEAR HARD
EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING FOR
THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS
OF A GREAT BRAIN ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLEMINDED SERVICE
CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION
ITS NOTHING HOLMES ITS A MERE SCRATCH
HE HAD RIPPED UP MY TROUSERS WITH HIS POCKETKNIFE
YOU ARE RIGHT HE CRIED WITH AN IMMENSE SIGH OF RELIEF IT IS
QUITE SUPERFICIAL HIS FACE SET LIKE FLINT AS HE GLARED AT OUR
PRISONER WHO WAS SITTING UP WITH A DAZED FACE BY THE LORD IT IS
AS WELL FOR YOU IF YOU HAD KILLED WATSON YOU WOULD NOT HAVE GOT OUT
OF THIS ROOM ALIVE NOW SIR WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY FOR YOURSELF
HE HAD NOTHING TO SAY FOR HIMSELF HE ONLY SAT AND SCOWLED I LEANED
ON HOLMESS ARM AND TOGETHER WE LOOKED DOWN INTO THE SMALL CELLAR
WHICH HAD BEEN DISCLOSED BY THE SECRET FLAP IT WAS STILL ILLUMINATED
BY THE CANDLE WHICH EVANS HAD TAKEN DOWN WITH HIM OUR EYES FELL UPON
A MASS OF RUSTED MACHINERY GREAT ROLLS OF PAPER A LITTER OF
BOTTLES AND NEATLY ARRANGED UPON A SMALL TABLE A NUMBER OF NEAT
LITTLE BUNDLES
A PRINTING PRESSA COUNTERFEITERS OUTFIT SAID HOLMES
YES SIR SAID OUR PRISONER STAGGERING SLOWLY TO HIS FEET AND THEN
SINKING INTO THE CHAIR THE GREATEST COUNTERFEITER LONDON EVER SAW
THATS PRESCOTTS MACHINE AND THOSE BUNDLES ON THE TABLE ARE TWO
THOUSAND OF PRESCOTTS NOTES WORTH A HUNDRED EACH AND FIT TO PASS
ANYWHERE HELP YOURSELVES GENTLEMEN CALL IT A DEAL AND LET ME BEAT
IT
HOLMES LAUGHED
WE DONT DO THINGS LIKE THAT MR EVANS THERE IS NO BOLTHOLE FOR
YOU IN THIS COUNTRY YOU SHOT THIS MAN PRESCOTT DID YOU NOT
YES SIR AND GOT FIVE YEARS FOR IT THOUGH IT WAS HE WHO PULLED ON
ME FIVE YEARSWHEN I SHOULD HAVE HAD A MEDAL THE SIZE OF A SOUP
PLATE NO LIVING MAN COULD TELL A PRESCOTT FROM A BANK OF ENGLAND
AND IF I HADNT PUT HIM OUT HE WOULD HAVE FLOODED LONDON WITH THEM I
WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD WHO KNEW WHERE HE MADE THEM CAN YOU
WONDER THAT I WANTED TO GET TO THE PLACE AND CAN YOU WONDER THAT
WHEN I FOUND THIS CRAZY BOOB OF A BUGHUNTER WITH THE QUEER NAME
SQUATTING RIGHT ON THE TOP OF IT AND NEVER QUITTING HIS ROOM I HAD
TO DO THE BEST I COULD TO SHIFT HIM MAYBE I WOULD HAVE BEEN WISER IF
I HAD PUT HIM AWAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY ENOUGH BUT IM A
SOFTHEARTED GUY THAT CANT BEGIN SHOOTING UNLESS THE OTHER MAN HAS A
GUN ALSO BUT SAY MR HOLMES WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG ANYHOW IVE
NOT USED THIS PLANT IVE NOT HURT THIS OLD STIFF WHERE DO YOU GET
ME
ONLY ATTEMPTED MURDER SO FAR AS I CAN SEE SAID HOLMES BUT
THATS NOT OUR JOB THEY TAKE THAT AT THE NEXT STAGE WHAT WE WANTED
AT PRESENT WAS JUST YOUR SWEET SELF PLEASE GIVE THE YARD A CALL
WATSON IT WONT BE ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED
SO THOSE WERE THE FACTS ABOUT KILLER EVANS AND HIS REMARKABLE
INVENTION OF THE THREE GARRIDEBS WE HEARD LATER THAT OUR POOR OLD
FRIEND NEVER GOT OVER THE SHOCK OF HIS DISSIPATED DREAMS WHEN HIS
CASTLE IN THE AIR FELL DOWN IT BURIED HIM BENEATH THE RUINS HE WAS
LAST HEARD OF AT A NURSINGHOME IN BRIXTON IT WAS A GLAD DAY AT THE
YARD WHEN THE PRESCOTT OUTFIT WAS DISCOVERED FOR THOUGH THEY KNEW
THAT IT EXISTED THEY HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE AFTER THE DEATH OF THE
MAN TO FIND OUT WHERE IT WAS EVANS HAD INDEED DONE GREAT SERVICE
AND CAUSED SEVERAL WORTHY C I D MEN TO SLEEP THE SOUNDER FOR THE
COUNTERFEITER STANDS IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF AS A PUBLIC DANGER THEY
WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO THAT SOUPPLATE MEDAL OF WHICH THE
CRIMINAL HAD SPOKEN BUT AN UNAPPRECIATIVE BENCH TOOK A LESS
FAVOURABLE VIEW AND THE KILLER RETURNED TO THOSE SHADES FROM WHICH
HE HAD JUST EMERGED
THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE
SOMEWHERE IN THE VAULTS OF THE BANK OF COX AND CO AT CHARING CROSS
THERE IS A TRAVELWORN AND BATTERED TIN DISPATCHBOX WITH MY NAME
JOHN H WATSON MD LATE INDIAN ARMY PAINTED UPON THE LID IT IS
CRAMMED WITH PAPERS NEARLY ALL OF WHICH ARE RECORDS OF CASES TO
ILLUSTRATE THE CURIOUS PROBLEMS WHICH MR SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD AT
VARIOUS TIMES TO EXAMINE SOME AND NOT THE LEAST INTERESTING WERE
COMPLETE FAILURES AND AS SUCH WILL HARDLY BEAR NARRATING SINCE NO
FINAL EXPLANATION IS FORTHCOMING A PROBLEM WITHOUT A SOLUTION MAY
INTEREST THE STUDENT BUT CAN HARDLY FAIL TO ANNOY THE CASUAL READER
AMONG THESE UNFINISHED TALES IS THAT OF MR JAMES PHILLIMORE WHO
STEPPING BACK INTO HIS OWN HOUSE TO GET HIS UMBRELLA WAS NEVER MORE
SEEN IN THIS WORLD NO LESS REMARKABLE IS THAT OF THE CUTTER ALICIA
WHICH SAILED ONE SPRING MORNING INTO A SMALL PATCH OF MIST FROM WHERE
SHE NEVER AGAIN EMERGED NOR WAS ANYTHING FURTHER EVER HEARD OF
HERSELF AND HER CREW A THIRD CASE WORTHY OF NOTE IS THAT OF ISADORA
PERSANO THE WELLKNOWN JOURNALIST AND DUELLIST WHO WAS FOUND STARK
STARING MAD WITH A MATCH BOX IN FRONT OF HIM WHICH CONTAINED A
REMARKABLE WORM SAID TO BE UNKNOWN TO SCIENCE APART FROM THESE
UNFATHOMED CASES THERE ARE SOME WHICH INVOLVE THE SECRETS OF PRIVATE
FAMILIES TO AN EXTENT WHICH WOULD MEAN CONSTERNATION IN MANY EXALTED
QUARTERS IF IT WERE THOUGHT POSSIBLE THAT THEY MIGHT FIND THEIR WAY
INTO PRINT I NEED NOT SAY THAT SUCH A BREACH OF CONFIDENCE IS
UNTHINKABLE AND THAT THESE RECORDS WILL BE SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
NOW THAT MY FRIEND HAS TIME TO TURN HIS ENERGIES TO THE MATTER THERE
REMAIN A CONSIDERABLE RESIDUE OF CASES OF GREATER OR LESS INTEREST
WHICH I MIGHT HAVE EDITED BEFORE HAD I NOT FEARED TO GIVE THE PUBLIC
A SURFEIT WHICH MIGHT REACT UPON THE REPUTATION OF THE MAN WHOM ABOVE
ALL OTHERS I REVERE IN SOME I WAS MYSELF CONCERNED AND CAN SPEAK AS
AN EYEWITNESS WHILE IN OTHERS I WAS EITHER NOT PRESENT OR PLAYED SO
SMALL A PART THAT THEY COULD ONLY BE TOLD AS BY A THIRD PERSON THE
FOLLOWING NARRATIVE IS DRAWN FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE
IT WAS A WILD MORNING IN OCTOBER AND I OBSERVED AS I WAS DRESSING
HOW THE LAST REMAINING LEAVES WERE BEING WHIRLED FROM THE SOLITARY
PLANE TREE WHICH GRACES THE YARD BEHIND OUR HOUSE I DESCENDED TO
BREAKFAST PREPARED TO FIND MY COMPANION IN DEPRESSED SPIRITS FOR
LIKE ALL GREAT ARTISTS HE WAS EASILY IMPRESSED BY HIS SURROUNDINGS
ON THE CONTRARY I FOUND THAT HE HAD NEARLY FINISHED HIS MEAL AND
THAT HIS MOOD WAS PARTICULARLY BRIGHT AND JOYOUS WITH THAT SOMEWHAT
SINISTER CHEERFULNESS WHICH WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS LIGHTER
MOMENTS
YOU HAVE A CASE HOLMES I REMARKED
THE FACULTY OF DEDUCTION IS CERTAINLY CONTAGIOUS WATSON HE
ANSWERED IT HAS ENABLED YOU TO PROBE MY SECRET YES I HAVE A CASE
AFTER A MONTH OF TRIVIALITIES AND STAGNATION THE WHEELS MOVE ONCE
MORE
MIGHT I SHARE IT
THERE IS LITTLE TO SHARE BUT WE MAY DISCUSS IT WHEN YOU HAVE
CONSUMED THE TWO HARDBOILED EGGS WITH WHICH OUR NEW COOK HAS
FAVOURED US THEIR CONDITION MAY NOT BE UNCONNECTED WITH THE COPY OF
THE FAMILY HERALD WHICH I OBSERVED YESTERDAY UPON THE HALLTABLE
EVEN SO TRIVIAL A MATTER AS COOKING AN EGG DEMANDS AN ATTENTION WHICH
IS CONSCIOUS OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME AND INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE LOVE
ROMANCE IN THAT EXCELLENT PERIODICAL
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER THE TABLE HAD BEEN CLEARED AND WE WERE
FACE TO FACE HE HAD DRAWN A LETTER FROM HIS POCKET
YOU HAVE HEARD OF NEIL GIBSON THE GOLD KING HE SAID
YOU MEAN THE AMERICAN SENATOR
WELL HE WAS ONCE SENATOR FOR SOME WESTERN STATE BUT IS BETTER
KNOWN AS THE GREATEST GOLDMINING MAGNATE IN THE WORLD
YES I KNOW OF HIM HE HAS SURELY LIVED IN ENGLAND FOR SOME TIME
HIS NAME IS VERY FAMILIAR
YES HE BOUGHT A CONSIDERABLE ESTATE IN HAMPSHIRE SOME FIVE YEARS
AGO POSSIBLY YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD OF THE TRAGIC END OF HIS WIFE
OF COURSE I REMEMBER IT NOW THAT IS WHY THE NAME IS FAMILIAR BUT
I REALLY KNOW NOTHING OF THE DETAILS
HOLMES WAVED HIS HAND TOWARDS SOME PAPERS ON A CHAIR I HAD NO IDEA
THAT THE CASE WAS COMING MY WAY OR I SHOULD HAVE HAD MY EXTRACTS
READY SAID HE THE FACT IS THAT THE PROBLEM THOUGH EXCEEDINGLY
SENSATIONAL APPEARED TO PRESENT NO DIFFICULTY THE INTERESTING
PERSONALITY OF THE ACCUSED DOES NOT OBSCURE THE CLEARNESS OF THE
EVIDENCE THAT WAS THE VIEW TAKEN BY THE CORONERS JURY AND ALSO IN
THE POLICECOURT PROCEEDINGS IT IS NOW REFERRED TO THE ASSIZES AT
WINCHESTER I FEAR IT IS A THANKLESS BUSINESS I CAN DISCOVER FACTS
WATSON BUT I CANNOT CHANGE THEM UNLESS SOME ENTIRELY NEW AND
UNEXPECTED ONES COME TO LIGHT I DO NOT SEE WHAT MY CLIENT CAN HOPE
FOR
YOUR CLIENT
AH I FORGOT I HAD NOT TOLD YOU I AM GETTING INTO YOUR INVOLVED
HABIT WATSON OF TELLING A STORY BACKWARD YOU HAD BEST READ THIS
FIRST
THE LETTER WHICH HE HANDED TO ME WRITTEN IN A BOLD MASTERFUL HAND
RAN AS FOLLOWS
CLARIDGES HOTEL
OCTOBER RD
DEAR MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
I CANT SEE THE BEST WOMAN GOD EVER MADE GO TO HER DEATH WITHOUT
DOING ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO SAVE HER I CANT EXPLAIN THINGSI
CANT EVEN TRY TO EXPLAIN THEM BUT I KNOW BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT MISS
DUNBAR IS INNOCENT YOU KNOW THE FACTSWHO DOESNT IT HAS BEEN THE
GOSSIP OF THE COUNTRY AND NEVER A VOICE RAISED FOR HER ITS THE
DAMNED INJUSTICE OF IT ALL THAT MAKES ME CRAZY THAT WOMAN HAS A
HEART THAT WOULDNT LET HER KILL A FLY WELL ILL COME AT ELEVEN
TOMORROW AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET SOME RAY OF LIGHT IN THE DARK MAYBE
I HAVE A CLUE AND DONT KNOW IT ANYHOW ALL I KNOW AND ALL I HAVE
AND ALL I AM ARE FOR YOUR USE IF ONLY YOU CAN SAVE HER IF EVER IN
YOUR LIFE YOU SHOWED YOUR POWERS PUT THEM NOW INTO THIS CASE
YOURS FAITHFULLY
J NEIL GIBSON
THERE YOU HAVE IT SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES KNOCKING OUT THE ASHES OF
HIS AFTERBREAKFAST PIPE AND SLOWLY REFILLING IT THAT IS THE
GENTLEMAN I AWAIT AS TO THE STORY YOU HAVE HARDLY TIME TO MASTER
ALL THESE PAPERS SO I MUST GIVE IT TO YOU IN A NUTSHELL IF YOU ARE
TO TAKE AN INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN THE PROCEEDINGS THIS MAN IS THE
GREATEST FINANCIAL POWER IN THE WORLD AND A MAN AS I UNDERSTAND OF
MOST VIOLENT AND FORMIDABLE CHARACTER HE MARRIED A WIFE THE VICTIM
OF THIS TRAGEDY OF WHOM I KNOW NOTHING SAVE THAT SHE WAS PAST HER
PRIME WHICH WAS THE MORE UNFORTUNATE AS A VERY ATTRACTIVE GOVERNESS
SUPERINTENDED THE EDUCATION OF TWO YOUNG CHILDREN THESE ARE THE
THREE PEOPLE CONCERNED AND THE SCENE IS A GRAND OLD MANOR HOUSE THE
CENTRE OF A HISTORICAL ENGLISH STATE THEN AS TO THE TRAGEDY THE
WIFE WAS FOUND IN THE GROUNDS NEARLY HALF A MILE FROM THE HOUSE LATE
AT NIGHT CLAD IN HER DINNER DRESS WITH A SHAWL OVER HER SHOULDERS
AND A REVOLVER BULLET THROUGH HER BRAIN NO WEAPON WAS FOUND NEAR HER
AND THERE WAS NO LOCAL CLUE AS TO THE MURDER NO WEAPON NEAR HER
WATSONMARK THAT THE CRIME SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED LATE IN THE
EVENING AND THE BODY WAS FOUND BY A GAMEKEEPER ABOUT ELEVEN
OCLOCK WHEN IT WAS EXAMINED BY THE POLICE AND BY A DOCTOR BEFORE
BEING CARRIED UP TO THE HOUSE IS THIS TOO CONDENSED OR CAN YOU
FOLLOW IT CLEARLY
IT IS ALL VERY CLEAR BUT WHY SUSPECT THE GOVERNESS
WELL IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE IS SOME VERY DIRECT EVIDENCE A
REVOLVER WITH ONE DISCHARGED CHAMBER AND A CALIBRE WHICH CORRESPONDED
WITH THE BULLET WAS FOUND ON THE FLOOR OF HER WARDROBE HIS EYES
FIXED AND HE REPEATED IN BROKEN WORDS
ONTHEFLOOROFHERWARDROBE THEN HE SANK INTO SILENCE AND I
SAW THAT SOME TRAIN OF THOUGHT HAD BEEN SET MOVING WHICH I SHOULD BE
FOOLISH TO INTERRUPT SUDDENLY WITH A START HE EMERGED INTO BRISK
LIFE ONCE MORE YES WATSON IT WAS FOUND PRETTY DAMNING EH SO
THE TWO JURIES THOUGHT THEN THE DEAD WOMAN HAD A NOTE UPON HER
MAKING AN APPOINTMENT AT THAT VERY PLACE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNESS
HOWS THAT FINALLY THERE IS THE MOTIVE SENATOR GIBSON IS AN
ATTRACTIVE PERSON IF HIS WIFE DIES WHO MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED HER
THAN THE YOUNG LADY WHO HAD ALREADY BY ALL ACCOUNTS RECEIVED PRESSING
ATTENTIONS FROM HER EMPLOYER LOVE FORTUNE POWER ALL DEPENDING
UPON ONE MIDDLEAGED LIFE UGLY WATSONVERY UGLY
YES INDEED HOLMES
NOR COULD SHE PROVE AN ALIBI ON THE CONTRARY SHE HAD TO ADMIT THAT
SHE WAS DOWN NEAR THOR BRIDGETHAT WAS THE SCENE OF THE
TRAGEDYABOUT THAT HOUR SHE COULDNT DENY IT FOR SOME PASSING
VILLAGER HAD SEEN HER THERE
THAT REALLY SEEMS FINAL
AND YET WATSONAND YET THIS BRIDGEA SINGLE BROAD SPAN OF STONE
WITH BALUSTRADED SIDESCARRIES THE DRIVE OVER THE NARROWEST PART OF
A LONG DEEP REEDGIRT SHEET OF WATER THOR MERE IT IS CALLED IN
THE MOUTH OF THE BRIDGE LAY THE DEAD WOMAN SUCH ARE THE MAIN FACTS
BUT HERE IF I MISTAKE NOT IS OUR CLIENT CONSIDERABLY BEFORE HIS
TIME
BILLY HAD OPENED THE DOOR BUT THE NAME WHICH HE ANNOUNCED WAS AN
UNEXPECTED ONE MR MARLOW BATES WAS A STRANGER TO BOTH OF US HE WAS
A THIN NERVOUS WISP OF A MAN WITH FRIGHTENED EYES AND A TWITCHING
HESITATING MANNERA MAN WHOM MY OWN PROFESSIONAL EYE WOULD JUDGE TO
BE ON THE BRINK OF AN ABSOLUTE NERVOUS BREAKDOWN
YOU SEEM AGITATED MR BATES SAID HOLMES PRAY SIT DOWN I FEAR I
CAN ONLY GIVE YOU A SHORT TIME FOR I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT ELEVEN
I KNOW YOU HAVE OUR VISITOR GASPED SHOOTING OUT SHORT SENTENCES
LIKE A MAN WHO IS OUT OF BREATH MR GIBSON IS COMING MR GIBSON IS
MY EMPLOYER I AM MANAGER OF HIS ESTATE MR HOLMES HE IS A
VILLAINAN INFERNAL VILLAIN
STRONG LANGUAGE MR BATES
I HAVE TO BE EMPHATIC MR HOLMES FOR THE TIME IS SO LIMITED I
WOULD NOT HAVE HIM FIND ME HERE FOR THE WORLD HE IS ALMOST DUE NOW
BUT I WAS SO SITUATED THAT I COULD NOT COME EARLIER HIS SECRETARY
MR FERGUSON ONLY TOLD ME THIS MORNING OF HIS APPOINTMENT WITH YOU
AND YOU ARE HIS MANAGER
I HAVE GIVEN HIM NOTICE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS I SHALL HAVE SHAKEN
OFF HIS ACCURSED SLAVERY A HARD MAN MR HOLMES HARD TO ALL ABOUT
HIM THOSE PUBLIC CHARITIES ARE A SCREEN TO COVER HIS PRIVATE
INIQUITIES BUT HIS WIFE WAS HIS CHIEF VICTIM HE WAS BRUTAL TO
HERYES SIR BRUTAL HOW SHE CAME BY HER DEATH I DO NOT KNOW BUT I
AM SURE THAT HE HAD MADE HER LIFE A MISERY TO HER SHE WAS A CREATURE
OF THE TROPICS A BRAZILIAN BY BIRTH AS NO DOUBT YOU KNOW
NO IT HAD ESCAPED ME
TROPICAL BY BIRTH AND TROPICAL BY NATURE A CHILD OF THE SUN AND OF
PASSION SHE HAD LOVED HIM AS SUCH WOMEN CAN LOVE BUT WHEN HER OWN
PHYSICAL CHARMS HAD FADEDI AM TOLD THAT THEY ONCE WERE GREATTHERE
WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM WE ALL LIKED HER AND FELT FOR HER AND HATED
HIM FOR THE WAY THAT HE TREATED HER BUT HE IS PLAUSIBLE AND CUNNING
THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU DONT TAKE HIM AT HIS FACE VALUE
THERE IS MORE BEHIND NOW ILL GO NO NO DONT DETAIN ME HE IS
ALMOST DUE
WITH A FRIGHTENED LOOK AT THE CLOCK OUR STRANGE VISITOR LITERALLY RAN
TO THE DOOR AND DISAPPEARED
WELL WELL SAID HOLMES AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SILENCE MR GIBSON
SEEMS TO HAVE A NICE LOYAL HOUSEHOLD BUT THE WARNING IS A USEFUL
ONE AND NOW WE CAN ONLY WAIT TILL THE MAN HIMSELF APPEARS
SHARP AT THE HOUR WE HEARD A HEAVY STEP UPON THE STAIRS AND THE
FAMOUS MILLIONAIRE WAS SHOWN INTO THE ROOM AS I LOOKED UPON HIM I
UNDERSTOOD NOT ONLY THE FEARS AND DISLIKE OF HIS MANAGER BUT ALSO THE
EXECRATIONS WHICH SO MANY BUSINESS RIVALS HAVE HEAPED UPON HIS HEAD
IF I WERE A SCULPTOR AND DESIRED TO IDEALIZE THE SUCCESSFUL MAN OF
AFFAIRS IRON OF NERVE AND LEATHERY OF CONSCIENCE I SHOULD CHOOSE
MR NEIL GIBSON AS MY MODEL HIS TALL GAUNT CRAGGY FIGURE HAD A
SUGGESTION OF HUNGER AND RAPACITY AN ABRAHAM LINCOLN KEYED TO BASE
USES INSTEAD OF HIGH ONES WOULD GIVE SOME IDEA OF THE MAN HIS FACE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN CHISELLED IN GRANITE HARDSET CRAGGY REMORSELESS
WITH DEEP LINES UPON IT THE SCARS OF MANY A CRISIS COLD GRAY EYES
LOOKING SHREWDLY OUT FROM UNDER BRISTLING BROWS SURVEYED US EACH IN
TURN HE BOWED IN PERFUNCTORY FASHION AS HOLMES MENTIONED MY NAME
AND THEN WITH A MASTERFUL AIR OF POSSESSION HE DREW A CHAIR UP TO MY
COMPANION AND SEATED HIMSELF WITH HIS BONY KNEES ALMOST TOUCHING HIM
LET ME SAY RIGHT HERE MR HOLMES HE BEGAN THAT MONEY IS NOTHING
TO ME IN THIS CASE YOU CAN BURN IT IF ITS ANY USE IN LIGHTING YOU
TO THE TRUTH THIS WOMAN IS INNOCENT AND THIS WOMAN HAS TO BE
CLEARED AND ITS UP TO YOU TO DO IT NAME YOUR FIGURE
MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE SAID HOLMES COLDLY
I DO NOT VARY THEM SAVE WHEN I REMIT THEM ALTOGETHER
WELL IF DOLLARS MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU THINK OF THE REPUTATION
IF YOU PULL THIS OFF EVERY PAPER IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA WILL BE
BOOMING YOU YOULL BE THE TALK OF TWO CONTINENTS
THANK YOU MR GIBSON I DO NOT THINK THAT I AM IN NEED OF BOOMING
IT MAY SURPRISE YOU TO KNOW THAT I PREFER TO WORK ANONYMOUSLY AND
THAT IT IS THE PROBLEM ITSELF WHICH ATTRACTS ME BUT WE ARE WASTING
TIME LET US GET DOWN TO THE FACTS
I THINK THAT YOU WILL FIND ALL THE MAIN ONES IN THE PRESS REPORTS I
DONT KNOW THAT I CAN ADD ANYTHING WHICH WILL HELP YOU BUT IF THERE
IS ANYTHING YOU WOULD WISH MORE LIGHT UPONWELL I AM HERE TO GIVE
IT
WELL THERE IS JUST ONE POINT
WHAT IS IT
WHAT WERE THE EXACT RELATIONS BETWEEN YOU AND MISS DUNBAR
THE GOLD KING GAVE A VIOLENT START AND HALF ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR THEN
HIS MASSIVE CALM CAME BACK TO HIM
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE WITHIN YOUR RIGHTSAND MAYBE DOING YOUR DUTYIN
ASKING SUCH A QUESTION MR HOLMES
WE WILL AGREE TO SUPPOSE SO SAID HOLMES
THEN I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT OUR RELATIONS WERE ENTIRELY AND ALWAYS
THOSE OF AN EMPLOYER TOWARDS A YOUNG LADY WHOM HE NEVER CONVERSED
WITH OR EVER SAW SAVE WHEN SHE WAS IN THE COMPANY OF HIS CHILDREN
HOLMES ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR
I AM A RATHER BUSY MAN MR GIBSON SAID HE AND I HAVE NO TIME OR
TASTE FOR AIMLESS CONVERSATIONS I WISH YOU GOODMORNING
OUR VISITOR HAD RISEN ALSO AND HIS GREAT LOOSE FIGURE TOWERED ABOVE
HOLMES THERE WAS AN ANGRY GLEAM FROM UNDER THOSE BRISTLING BROWS AND
A TINGE OF COLOUR IN THE SALLOW CHEEKS
WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU MEAN BY THIS MR HOLMES DO YOU DISMISS MY
CASE
WELL MR GIBSON AT LEAST I DISMISS YOU I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT MY
WORDS WERE PLAIN
PLAIN ENOUGH BUT WHATS AT THE BACK OF IT RAISING THE PRICE ON ME
OR AFRAID TO TACKLE IT OR WHAT IVE A RIGHT TO A PLAIN ANSWER
WELL PERHAPS YOU HAVE SAID HOLMES ILL GIVE YOU ONE THIS CASE
IS QUITE SUFFICIENTLY COMPLICATED TO START WITH WITHOUT THE FURTHER
DIFFICULTY OF FALSE INFORMATION
MEANING THAT I LIE
WELL I WAS TRYING TO EXPRESS IT AS DELICATELY AS I COULD BUT IF
YOU INSIST UPON THE WORD I WILL NOT CONTRADICT YOU
I SPRANG TO MY FEET FOR THE EXPRESSION UPON THE MILLIONAIRES FACE
WAS FIENDISH IN ITS INTENSITY AND HE HAD RAISED HIS GREAT KNOTTED
FIST HOLMES SMILED LANGUIDLY AND REACHED HIS HAND OUT FOR HIS PIPE
DONT BE NOISY MR GIBSON I FIND THAT AFTER BREAKFAST EVEN THE
SMALLEST ARGUMENT IS UNSETTLING I SUGGEST THAT A STROLL IN THE
MORNING AIR AND A LITTLE QUIET THOUGHT WILL BE GREATLY TO YOUR
ADVANTAGE
WITH AN EFFORT THE GOLD KING MASTERED HIS FURY I COULD NOT BUT
ADMIRE HIM FOR BY A SUPREME SELFCOMMAND HE HAD TURNED IN A MINUTE
FROM A HOT FLAME OF ANGER TO A FRIGID AND CONTEMPTUOUS INDIFFERENCE
WELL ITS YOUR CHOICE I GUESS YOU KNOW HOW TO RUN YOUR OWN
BUSINESS I CANT MAKE YOU TOUCH THE CASE AGAINST YOUR WILL YOUVE
DONE YOURSELF NO GOOD THIS MORNING MR HOLMES FOR I HAVE BROKEN
STRONGER MEN THAN YOU NO MAN EVER CROSSED ME AND WAS THE BETTER FOR
IT
SO MANY HAVE SAID SO AND YET HERE I AM SAID HOLMES SMILING
WELL GOODMORNING MR GIBSON YOU HAVE A GOOD DEAL YET TO LEARN
OUR VISITOR MADE A NOISY EXIT BUT HOLMES SMOKED IN IMPERTURBABLE
SILENCE WITH DREAMY EYES FIXED UPON THE CEILING
ANY VIEWS WATSON HE ASKED AT LAST
WELL HOLMES I MUST CONFESS THAT WHEN I CONSIDER THAT THIS IS A MAN
WHO WOULD CERTAINLY BRUSH ANY OBSTACLE FROM HIS PATH AND WHEN I
REMEMBER THAT HIS WIFE MAY HAVE BEEN AN OBSTACLE AND AN OBJECT OF
DISLIKE AS THAT MAN BATES PLAINLY TOLD US IT SEEMS TO ME
EXACTLY AND TO ME ALSO
BUT WHAT WERE HIS RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNESS AND HOW DID YOU
DISCOVER THEM
BLUFF WATSON BLUFF WHEN I CONSIDERED THE PASSIONATE
UNCONVENTIONAL UNBUSINESSLIKE TONE OF HIS LETTER AND CONTRASTED IT
WITH HIS SELFCONTAINED MANNER AND APPEARANCE IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR
THAT THERE WAS SOME DEEP EMOTION WHICH CENTRED UPON THE ACCUSED WOMAN
RATHER THAN UPON THE VICTIM WEVE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THE EXACT
RELATIONS OF THOSE THREE PEOPLE IF WE ARE TO REACH THE TRUTH YOU SAW
THE FRONTAL ATTACK WHICH I MADE UPON HIM AND HOW IMPERTURBABLY HE
RECEIVED IT THEN I BLUFFED HIM BY GIVING HIM THE IMPRESSION THAT I
WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN WHEN IN REALITY I WAS ONLY EXTREMELY
SUSPICIOUS
PERHAPS HE WILL COME BACK
HE IS SURE TO COME BACK HE MUST COME BACK HE CANT LEAVE IT WHERE
IT IS HA ISNT THAT A RING YES THERE IS HIS FOOTSTEP WELL MR
GIBSON I WAS JUST SAYING TO DR WATSON THAT YOU WERE SOMEWHAT
OVERDUE
THE GOLD KING HAD REENTERED THE ROOM IN A MORE CHASTENED MOOD THAN HE
HAD LEFT IT HIS WOUNDED PRIDE STILL SHOWED IN HIS RESENTFUL EYES
BUT HIS COMMON SENSE HAD SHOWN HIM THAT HE MUST YIELD IF HE WOULD
ATTAIN HIS END
IVE BEEN THINKING IT OVER MR HOLMES AND I FEEL THAT I HAVE BEEN
HASTY IN TAKING YOUR REMARKS AMISS YOU ARE JUSTIFIED IN GETTING DOWN
TO THE FACTS WHATEVER THEY MAY BE AND I THINK THE MORE OF YOU FOR
IT I CAN ASSURE YOU HOWEVER THAT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN MISS DUNBAR
AND ME DONT REALLY TOUCH THIS CASE
THAT IS FOR ME TO DECIDE IS IT NOT
YES I GUESS THAT IS SO YOURE LIKE A SURGEON WHO WANTS EVERY
SYMPTOM BEFORE HE CAN GIVE HIS DIAGNOSIS
EXACTLY THAT EXPRESSES IT AND IT IS ONLY A PATIENT WHO HAS AN
OBJECT IN DECEIVING HIS SURGEON WHO WOULD CONCEAL THE FACTS OF HIS
CASE
THAT MAY BE SO BUT YOU WILL ADMIT MR HOLMES THAT MOST MEN WOULD
SHY OFF A BIT WHEN THEY ARE ASKED POINTBLANK WHAT THEIR RELATIONS
WITH A WOMAN MAY BEIF THERE IS REALLY SOME SERIOUS FEELING IN THE
CASE I GUESS MOST MEN HAVE A LITTLE PRIVATE RESERVE OF THEIR OWN IN
SOME CORNER OF THEIR SOULS WHERE THEY DONT WELCOME INTRUDERS AND
YOU BURST SUDDENLY INTO IT BUT THE OBJECT EXCUSES YOU SINCE IT WAS
TO TRY AND SAVE HER WELL THE STAKES ARE DOWN AND THE RESERVE OPEN
AND YOU CAN EXPLORE WHERE YOU WILL WHAT IS IT YOU WANT
THE TRUTH
THE GOLD KING PAUSED FOR A MOMENT AS ONE WHO MARSHALS HIS THOUGHTS
HIS GRIM DEEPLINED FACE HAD BECOME EVEN SADDER AND MORE GRAVE
I CAN GIVE IT TO YOU IN A VERY FEW WORDS MR HOLMES SAID HE AT
LAST THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE PAINFUL AS WELL AS DIFFICULT TO
SAY SO I WONT GO DEEPER THAN IS NEEDFUL I MET MY WIFE WHEN I WAS
GOLDHUNTING IN BRAZIL MARIA PINTO WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A GOVERNMENT
OFFICIAL AT MANAOS AND SHE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL I WAS YOUNG AND
ARDENT IN THOSE DAYS BUT EVEN NOW AS I LOOK BACK WITH COLDER BLOOD
AND A MORE CRITICAL EYE I CAN SEE THAT SHE WAS RARE AND WONDERFUL IN
HER BEAUTY IT WAS A DEEP RICH NATURE TOO PASSIONATE
WHOLEHEARTED TROPICAL ILLBALANCED VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE
AMERICAN WOMEN WHOM I HAD KNOWN WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT I
LOVED HER AND I MARRIED HER IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE ROMANCE HAD
PASSEDAND IT LINGERED FOR YEARSTHAT I REALIZED THAT WE HAD
NOTHINGABSOLUTELY NOTHINGIN COMMON MY LOVE FADED IF HERS HAD
FADED ALSO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EASIER BUT YOU KNOW THE WONDERFUL WAY
OF WOMEN DO WHAT I MIGHT NOTHING COULD TURN HER FROM ME IF I HAVE
BEEN HARSH TO HER EVEN BRUTAL AS SOME HAVE SAID IT HAS BEEN BECAUSE
I KNEW THAT IF I COULD KILL HER LOVE OR IF IT TURNED TO HATE IT
WOULD BE EASIER FOR BOTH OF US BUT NOTHING CHANGED HER SHE ADORED
ME IN THOSE ENGLISH WOODS AS SHE HAD ADORED ME TWENTY YEARS AGO ON
THE BANKS OF THE AMAZON DO WHAT I MIGHT SHE WAS AS DEVOTED AS EVER
THEN CAME MISS GRACE DUNBAR SHE ANSWERED OUR ADVERTISEMENT AND
BECAME GOVERNESS TO OUR TWO CHILDREN PERHAPS YOU HAVE SEEN HER
PORTRAIT IN THE PAPERS THE WHOLE WORLD HAS PROCLAIMED THAT SHE ALSO
IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN NOW I MAKE NO PRETENCE TO BE MORE MORAL
THAN MY NEIGHBOURS AND I WILL ADMIT TO YOU THAT I COULD NOT LIVE
UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH SUCH A WOMAN AND IN DAILY CONTACT WITH HER
WITHOUT FEELING A PASSIONATE REGARD FOR HER DO YOU BLAME ME MR
HOLMES
I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR FEELING IT I SHOULD BLAME YOU IF YOU
EXPRESSED IT SINCE THIS YOUNG LADY WAS IN A SENSE UNDER YOUR
PROTECTION
WELL MAYBE SO SAID THE MILLIONAIRE THOUGH FOR A MOMENT THE
REPROOF HAD BROUGHT THE OLD ANGRY GLEAM INTO HIS EYES IM NOT
PRETENDING TO BE ANY BETTER THAN I AM I GUESS ALL MY LIFE IVE BEEN
A MAN THAT REACHED OUT HIS HAND FOR WHAT HE WANTED AND I NEVER
WANTED ANYTHING MORE THAN THE LOVE AND POSSESSION OF THAT WOMAN I
TOLD HER SO
OH YOU DID DID YOU
HOLMES COULD LOOK VERY FORMIDABLE WHEN HE WAS MOVED
I SAID TO HER THAT IF I COULD MARRY HER I WOULD BUT THAT IT WAS OUT
OF MY POWER I SAID THAT MONEY WAS NO OBJECT AND THAT ALL I COULD DO
TO MAKE HER HAPPY AND COMFORTABLE WOULD BE DONE
VERY GENEROUS I AM SURE SAID HOLMES WITH A SNEER
SEE HERE MR HOLMES I CAME TO YOU ON A QUESTION OF EVIDENCE NOT
ON A QUESTION OF MORALS IM NOT ASKING FOR YOUR CRITICISM
IT IS ONLY FOR THE YOUNG LADYS SAKE THAT I TOUCH YOUR CASE AT ALL
SAID HOLMES STERNLY I DONT KNOW THAT ANYTHING SHE IS ACCUSED OF IS
REALLY WORSE THAN WHAT YOU HAVE YOURSELF ADMITTED THAT YOU HAVE
TRIED TO RUIN A DEFENCELESS GIRL WHO WAS UNDER YOUR ROOF SOME OF YOU
RICH MEN HAVE TO BE TAUGHT THAT ALL THE WORLD CANNOT BE BRIBED INTO
CONDONING YOUR OFFENCES
TO MY SURPRISE THE GOLD KING TOOK THE REPROOF WITH EQUANIMITY
THATS HOW I FEEL MYSELF ABOUT IT NOW I THANK GOD THAT MY PLANS DID
NOT WORK OUT AS I INTENDED SHE WOULD HAVE NONE OF IT AND SHE WANTED
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE INSTANTLY
WHY DID SHE NOT
WELL IN THE FIRST PLACE OTHERS WERE DEPENDENT UPON HER AND IT WAS
NO LIGHT MATTER FOR HER TO LET THEM ALL DOWN BY SACRIFICING HER
LIVING WHEN I HAD SWORNAS I DIDTHAT SHE SHOULD NEVER BE MOLESTED
AGAIN SHE CONSENTED TO REMAIN BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON SHE
KNEW THE INFLUENCE SHE HAD OVER ME AND THAT IT WAS STRONGER THAN ANY
OTHER INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD SHE WANTED TO USE IT FOR GOOD
HOW
WELL SHE KNEW SOMETHING OF MY AFFAIRS THEY ARE LARGE MR
HOLMESLARGE BEYOND THE BELIEF OF AN ORDINARY MAN I CAN MAKE OR
BREAKAND IT IS USUALLY BREAK IT WASNT INDIVIDUALS ONLY IT WAS
COMMUNITIES CITIES EVEN NATIONS BUSINESS IS A HARD GAME AND THE
WEAK GO TO THE WALL I PLAYED THE GAME FOR ALL IT WAS WORTH I NEVER
SQUEALED MYSELF AND I NEVER CARED IF THE OTHER FELLOW SQUEALED BUT
SHE SAW IT DIFFERENT I GUESS SHE WAS RIGHT SHE BELIEVED AND SAID
THAT A FORTUNE FOR ONE MAN THAT WAS MORE THAN HE NEEDED SHOULD NOT BE
BUILT ON TEN THOUSAND RUINED MEN WHO WERE LEFT WITHOUT THE MEANS OF
LIFE THAT WAS HOW SHE SAW IT AND I GUESS SHE COULD SEE PAST THE
DOLLARS TO SOMETHING THAT WAS MORE LASTING SHE FOUND THAT I LISTENED
TO WHAT SHE SAID AND SHE BELIEVED SHE WAS SERVING THE WORLD BY
INFLUENCING MY ACTIONS SO SHE STAYEDAND THEN THIS CAME ALONG
CAN YOU THROW ANY LIGHT UPON THAT
THE GOLD KING PAUSED FOR A MINUTE OR MORE HIS HEAD SUNK IN HIS
HANDS LOST IN DEEP THOUGHT
ITS VERY BLACK AGAINST HER I CANT DENY THAT AND WOMEN LEAD AN
INWARD LIFE AND MAY DO THINGS BEYOND THE JUDGMENT OF A MAN AT FIRST
I WAS SO RATTLED AND TAKEN ABACK THAT I WAS READY TO THINK SHE HAD
BEEN LED AWAY IN SOME EXTRAORDINARY FASHION THAT WAS CLEAN AGAINST
HER USUAL NATURE ONE EXPLANATION CAME INTO MY HEAD I GIVE IT TO
YOU MR HOLMES FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT MY WIFE
WAS BITTERLY JEALOUS THERE IS A SOULJEALOUSY THAT CAN BE AS FRANTIC
AS ANY BODYJEALOUSY AND THOUGH MY WIFE HAD NO CAUSEAND I THINK
SHE UNDERSTOOD THISFOR THE LATTER SHE WAS AWARE THAT THIS ENGLISH
GIRL EXERTED AN INFLUENCE UPON MY MIND AND MY ACTS THAT SHE HERSELF
NEVER HAD IT WAS AN INFLUENCE FOR GOOD BUT THAT DID NOT MEND THE
MATTER SHE WAS CRAZY WITH HATRED AND THE HEAT OF THE AMAZON WAS
ALWAYS IN HER BLOOD SHE MIGHT HAVE PLANNED TO MURDER MISS DUNBAROR
WE WILL SAY TO THREATEN HER WITH A GUN AND SO FRIGHTEN HER INTO
LEAVING US THEN THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SCUFFLE AND THE GUN GONE OFF
AND SHOT THE WOMAN WHO HELD IT
THAT POSSIBILITY HAD ALREADY OCCURRED TO ME SAID HOLMES INDEED
IT IS THE ONLY OBVIOUS ALTERNATIVE TO DELIBERATE MURDER
BUT SHE UTTERLY DENIES IT
WELL THAT IS NOT FINALIS IT ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT A WOMAN
PLACED IN SO AWFUL A POSITION MIGHT HURRY HOME STILL IN HER
BEWILDERMENT HOLDING THE REVOLVER SHE MIGHT EVEN THROW IT DOWN AMONG
HER CLOTHES HARDLY KNOWING WHAT SHE WAS DOING AND WHEN IT WAS FOUND
SHE MIGHT TRY TO LIE HER WAY OUT BY A TOTAL DENIAL SINCE ALL
EXPLANATION WAS IMPOSSIBLE WHAT IS AGAINST SUCH A SUPPOSITION
MISS DUNBAR HERSELF
WELL PERHAPS
HOLMES LOOKED AT HIS WATCH I HAVE NO DOUBT WE CAN GET THE NECESSARY
PERMITS THIS MORNING AND REACH WINCHESTER BY THE EVENING TRAIN WHEN
I HAVE SEEN THIS YOUNG LADY IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE OF MORE
USE TO YOU IN THE MATTER THOUGH I CANNOT PROMISE THAT MY CONCLUSIONS
WILL NECESSARILY BE SUCH AS YOU DESIRE
THERE WAS SOME DELAY IN THE OFFICIAL PASS AND INSTEAD OF REACHING
WINCHESTER THAT DAY WE WENT DOWN TO THOR PLACE THE HAMPSHIRE ESTATE
OF MR NEIL GIBSON HE DID NOT ACCOMPANY US HIMSELF BUT WE HAD THE
ADDRESS OF SERGEANT COVENTRY OF THE LOCAL POLICE WHO HAD FIRST
EXAMINED INTO THE AFFAIR HE WAS A TALL THIN CADAVEROUS MAN WITH A
SECRETIVE AND MYSTERIOUS MANNER WHICH CONVEYED THE IDEA THAT HE KNEW
OR SUSPECTED A VERY GREAT DEAL MORE THAN HE DARED SAY HE HAD A
TRICK TOO OF SUDDENLY SINKING HIS VOICE TO A WHISPER AS IF HE HAD
COME UPON SOMETHING OF VITAL IMPORTANCE THOUGH THE INFORMATION WAS
USUALLY COMMONPLACE ENOUGH BEHIND THESE TRICKS OF MANNER HE SOON
SHOWED HIMSELF TO BE A DECENT HONEST FELLOW WHO WAS NOT TOO PROUD TO
ADMIT THAT HE WAS OUT OF HIS DEPTH AND WOULD WELCOME ANY HELP
ANYHOW ID RATHER HAVE YOU THAN SCOTLAND YARD MR HOLMES SAID
HE IF THE YARD GETS CALLED INTO A CASE THEN THE LOCAL LOSES ALL
CREDIT FOR SUCCESS AND MAY BE BLAMED FOR FAILURE NOW YOU PLAY
STRAIGHT SO IVE HEARD
I NEED NOT APPEAR IN THE MATTER AT ALL SAID HOLMES TO THE EVIDENT
RELIEF OF OUR MELANCHOLY ACQUAINTANCE IF I CAN CLEAR IT UP I DONT
ASK TO HAVE MY NAME MENTIONED
WELL ITS VERY HANDSOME OF YOU I AM SURE AND YOUR FRIEND DR
WATSON CAN BE TRUSTED I KNOW NOW MR HOLMES AS WE WALK DOWN TO
THE PLACE THERE IS ONE QUESTION I SHOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ID BREATHE
IT TO NO SOUL BUT YOU HE LOOKED ROUND AS THOUGH HE HARDLY DARE
UTTER THE WORDS DONT YOU THINK THERE MIGHT BE A CASE AGAINST MR
NEIL GIBSON HIMSELF
I HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING THAT
YOUVE NOT SEEN MISS DUNBAR SHE IS A WONDERFUL FINE WOMAN IN EVERY
WAY HE MAY WELL HAVE WISHED HIS WIFE OUT OF THE ROAD AND THESE
AMERICANS ARE READIER WITH PISTOLS THAN OUR FOLK ARE IT WAS HIS
PISTOL YOU KNOW
WAS THAT CLEARLY MADE OUT
YES SIR IT WAS ONE OF A PAIR THAT HE HAD
ONE OF A PAIR WHERE IS THE OTHER
WELL THE GENTLEMAN HAS A LOT OF FIREARMS OF ONE SORT AND ANOTHER
WE NEVER QUITE MATCHED THAT PARTICULAR PISTOLBUT THE BOX WAS MADE
FOR TWO
IF IT WAS ONE OF A PAIR YOU SHOULD SURELY BE ABLE TO MATCH IT
WELL WE HAVE THEM ALL LAID OUT AT THE HOUSE IF YOU WOULD CARE TO
LOOK THEM OVER
LATER PERHAPS I THINK WE WILL WALK DOWN TOGETHER AND HAVE A LOOK
AT THE SCENE OF THE TRAGEDY
THIS CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE LITTLE FRONT ROOM OF
SERGEANT COVENTRYS HUMBLE COTTAGE WHICH SERVED AS THE LOCAL
POLICESTATION A WALK OF HALF A MILE OR SO ACROSS A WINDSWEPT
HEATH ALL GOLD AND BRONZE WITH THE FADING FERNS BROUGHT US TO A
SIDEGATE OPENING INTO THE GROUNDS OF THE THOR PLACE ESTATE A PATH
LED US THROUGH THE PHEASANT PRESERVES AND THEN FROM A CLEARING WE
SAW THE WIDESPREAD HALFTIMBERED HOUSE HALF TUDOR AND HALF
GEORGIAN UPON THE CREST OF THE HILL BESIDE US THERE WAS A LONG
REEDY POOL CONSTRICTED IN THE CENTRE WHERE THE MAIN CARRIAGE DRIVE
PASSED OVER A STONE BRIDGE BUT SWELLING INTO SMALL LAKES ON EITHER
SIDE OUR GUIDE PAUSED AT THE MOUTH OF THIS BRIDGE AND HE POINTED TO
THE GROUND
THAT WAS WHERE MRS GIBSONS BODY LAY I MARKED IT BY THAT STONE
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WERE THERE BEFORE IT WAS MOVED
YES THEY SENT FOR ME AT ONCE
WHO DID
MR GIBSON HIMSELF THE MOMENT THE ALARM WAS GIVEN AND HE HAD RUSHED
DOWN WITH OTHERS FROM THE HOUSE HE INSISTED THAT NOTHING SHOULD BE
MOVED UNTIL THE POLICE SHOULD ARRIVE
THAT WAS SENSIBLE I GATHERED FROM THE NEWSPAPER REPORT THAT THE
SHOT WAS FIRED FROM CLOSE QUARTERS
YES SIR VERY CLOSE
NEAR THE RIGHT TEMPLE
JUST BEHIND IT SIR
HOW DID THE BODY LIE
ON THE BACK SIR NO TRACE OF A STRUGGLE NO MARKS NO WEAPON THE
SHORT NOTE FROM MISS DUNBAR WAS CLUTCHED IN HER LEFT HAND
CLUTCHED YOU SAY
YES SIR WE COULD HARDLY OPEN THE FINGERS
THAT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IT EXCLUDES THE IDEA THAT ANYONE COULD
HAVE PLACED THE NOTE THERE AFTER DEATH IN ORDER TO FURNISH A FALSE
CLUE DEAR ME THE NOTE AS I REMEMBER WAS QUITE SHORT
I WILL BE AT THOR BRIDGE AT NINE OCLOCK
G DUNBAR
WAS THAT NOT SO
YES SIR
DID MISS DUNBAR ADMIT WRITING IT
YES SIR
WHAT WAS HER EXPLANATION
HER DEFENCE WAS RESERVED FOR THE ASSIZES SHE WOULD SAY NOTHING
THE PROBLEM IS CERTAINLY A VERY INTERESTING ONE THE POINT OF THE
LETTER IS VERY OBSCURE IS IT NOT
WELL SIR SAID THE GUIDE IT SEEMED IF I MAY BE SO BOLD AS TO
SAY SO THE ONLY REALLY CLEAR POINT IN THE WHOLE CASE
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD
GRANTING THAT THE LETTER IS GENUINE AND WAS REALLY WRITTEN IT WAS
CERTAINLY RECEIVED SOME TIME BEFORESAY ONE HOUR OR TWO WHY THEN
WAS THIS LADY STILL CLASPING IT IN HER LEFT HAND WHY SHOULD SHE
CARRY IT SO CAREFULLY SHE DID NOT NEED TO REFER TO IT IN THE
INTERVIEW DOES IT NOT SEEM REMARKABLE
WELL SIR AS YOU PUT IT PERHAPS IT DOES
I THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO SIT QUIETLY FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THINK IT
OUT HE SEATED HIMSELF UPON THE STONE LEDGE OF THE BRIDGE AND I
COULD SEE HIS QUICK GRAY EYES DARTING THEIR QUESTIONING GLANCES IN
EVERY DIRECTION SUDDENLY HE SPRANG UP AGAIN AND RAN ACROSS TO THE
OPPOSITE PARAPET WHIPPED HIS LENS FROM HIS POCKET AND BEGAN TO
EXAMINE THE STONEWORK
THIS IS CURIOUS SAID HE
YES SIR WE SAW THE CHIP ON THE LEDGE I EXPECT ITS BEEN DONE BY
SOME PASSERBY
THE STONEWORK WAS GRAY BUT AT THIS ONE POINT IT SHOWED WHITE FOR A
SPACE NOT LARGER THAN A SIXPENCE WHEN EXAMINED CLOSELY ONE COULD SEE
THAT THE SURFACE WAS CHIPPED AS BY A SHARP BLOW
IT TOOK SOME VIOLENCE TO DO THAT SAID HOLMES THOUGHTFULLY WITH
HIS CANE HE STRUCK THE LEDGE SEVERAL TIMES WITHOUT LEAVING A MARK
YES IT WAS A HARD KNOCK IN A CURIOUS PLACE TOO IT WAS NOT FROM
ABOVE BUT FROM BELOW FOR YOU SEE THAT IT IS ON THE LOWER EDGE OF THE
PARAPET
BUT IT IS AT LEAST FIFTEEN FEET FROM THE BODY
YES IT IS FIFTEEN FEET FROM THE BODY IT MAY HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE MATTER BUT IT IS A POINT WORTH NOTING I DO NOT THINK THAT
WE HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO LEARN HERE THERE WERE NO FOOTSTEPS YOU
SAY
THE GROUND WAS IRON HARD SIR THERE WERE NO TRACES AT ALL
THEN WE CAN GO WE WILL GO UP TO THE HOUSE FIRST AND LOOK OVER THESE
WEAPONS OF WHICH YOU SPEAK THEN WE SHALL GET ON TO WINCHESTER FOR I
SHOULD DESIRE TO SEE MISS DUNBAR BEFORE WE GO FARTHER
MR NEIL GIBSON HAD NOT RETURNED FROM TOWN BUT WE SAW IN THE HOUSE
THE NEUROTIC MR BATES WHO HAD CALLED UPON US IN THE MORNING HE
SHOWED US WITH A SINISTER RELISH THE FORMIDABLE ARRAY OF FIREARMS OF
VARIOUS SHAPES AND SIZES WHICH HIS EMPLOYER HAD ACCUMULATED IN THE
COURSE OF AN ADVENTUROUS LIFE
MR GIBSON HAS HIS ENEMIES AS ANYONE WOULD EXPECT WHO KNEW HIM AND
HIS METHODS SAID HE HE SLEEPS WITH A LOADED REVOLVER IN THE
DRAWER BESIDE HIS BED HE IS A MAN OF VIOLENCE SIR AND THERE ARE
TIMES WHEN ALL OF US ARE AFRAID OF HIM I AM SURE THAT THE POOR LADY
WHO HAS PASSED WAS OFTEN TERRIFIED
DID YOU EVER WITNESS PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TOWARDS HER
NO I CANNOT SAY THAT BUT I HAVE HEARD WORDS WHICH WERE NEARLY AS
BADWORDS OF COLD CUTTING CONTEMPT EVEN BEFORE THE SERVANTS
OUR MILLIONAIRE DOES NOT SEEM TO SHINE IN PRIVATE LIFE REMARKED
HOLMES AS WE MADE OUR WAY TO THE STATION WELL WATSON WE HAVE COME
ON A GOOD MANY FACTS SOME OF THEM NEW ONES AND YET I SEEM SOME WAY
FROM MY CONCLUSION IN SPITE OF THE VERY EVIDENT DISLIKE WHICH MR
BATES HAS TO HIS EMPLOYER I GATHER FROM HIM THAT WHEN THE ALARM CAME
HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY IN HIS LIBRARY DINNER WAS OVER AT AND ALL
WAS NORMAL UP TO THEN IT IS TRUE THAT THE ALARM WAS SOMEWHAT LATE IN
THE EVENING BUT THE TRAGEDY CERTAINLY OCCURRED ABOUT THE HOUR NAMED
IN THE NOTE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AT ALL THAT MR GIBSON HAD BEEN OUT
OF DOORS SINCE HIS RETURN FROM TOWN AT FIVE OCLOCK ON THE OTHER
HAND MISS DUNBAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT ADMITS THAT SHE HAD MADE AN
APPOINTMENT TO MEET MRS GIBSON AT THE BRIDGE BEYOND THIS SHE WOULD
SAY NOTHING AS HER LAWYER HAD ADVISED HER TO RESERVE HER DEFENCE WE
HAVE SEVERAL VERY VITAL QUESTIONS TO ASK THAT YOUNG LADY AND MY MIND
WILL NOT BE EASY UNTIL WE HAVE SEEN HER I MUST CONFESS THAT THE CASE
WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE VERY BLACK AGAINST HER IF IT WERE NOT FOR ONE
THING
AND WHAT IS THAT HOLMES
THE FINDING OF THE PISTOL IN HER WARDROBE
DEAR ME HOLMES I CRIED THAT SEEMED TO ME TO BE THE MOST DAMNING
INCIDENT OF ALL
NOT SO WATSON IT HAD STRUCK ME EVEN AT MY FIRST PERFUNCTORY
READING AS VERY STRANGE AND NOW THAT I AM IN CLOSER TOUCH WITH THE
CASE IT IS MY ONLY FIRM GROUND FOR HOPE WE MUST LOOK FOR
CONSISTENCY WHERE THERE IS A WANT OF IT WE MUST SUSPECT DECEPTION
I HARDLY FOLLOW YOU
WELL NOW WATSON SUPPOSE FOR A MOMENT THAT WE VISUALIZE YOU IN THE
CHARACTER OF A WOMAN WHO IN A COLD PREMEDITATED FASHION IS ABOUT
TO GET RID OF A RIVAL YOU HAVE PLANNED IT A NOTE HAS BEEN WRITTEN
THE VICTIM HAS COME YOU HAVE YOUR WEAPON THE CRIME IS DONE IT HAS
BEEN WORKMANLIKE AND COMPLETE DO YOU TELL ME THAT AFTER CARRYING OUT
SO CRAFTY A CRIME YOU WOULD NOW RUIN YOUR REPUTATION AS A CRIMINAL BY
FORGETTING TO FLING YOUR WEAPON INTO THOSE ADJACENT REEDBEDS WHICH
WOULD FOREVER COVER IT BUT YOU MUST NEEDS CARRY IT CAREFULLY HOME
AND PUT IT IN YOUR OWN WARDROBE THE VERY FIRST PLACE THAT WOULD BE
SEARCHED YOUR BEST FRIENDS WOULD HARDLY CALL YOU A SCHEMER WATSON
AND YET I COULD NOT PICTURE YOU DOING ANYTHING SO CRUDE AS THAT
IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT
NO NO WATSON I WILL NOT ADMIT THAT IT IS POSSIBLE WHERE A CRIME
IS COOLLY PREMEDITATED THEN THE MEANS OF COVERING IT ARE COOLLY
PREMEDITATED ALSO I HOPE THEREFORE THAT WE ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF
A SERIOUS MISCONCEPTION
BUT THERE IS SO MUCH TO EXPLAIN
WELL WE SHALL SET ABOUT EXPLAINING IT WHEN ONCE YOUR POINT OF VIEW
IS CHANGED THE VERY THING WHICH WAS SO DAMNING BECOMES A CLUE TO THE
TRUTH FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS THIS REVOLVER MISS DUNBAR DISCLAIMS ALL
KNOWLEDGE OF IT ON OUR NEW THEORY SHE IS SPEAKING TRUTH WHEN SHE
SAYS SO THEREFORE IT WAS PLACED IN HER WARDROBE WHO PLACED IT
THERE SOMEONE WHO WISHED TO INCRIMINATE HER WAS NOT THAT PERSON THE
ACTUAL CRIMINAL YOU SEE HOW WE COME AT ONCE UPON A MOST FRUITFUL
LINE OF INQUIRY
WE WERE COMPELLED TO SPEND THE NIGHT AT WINCHESTER AS THE
FORMALITIES HAD NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED BUT NEXT MORNING IN THE
COMPANY OF MR JOYCE CUMMINGS THE RISING BARRISTER WHO WAS ENTRUSTED
WITH THE DEFENCE WE WERE ALLOWED TO SEE THE YOUNG LADY IN HER CELL
I HAD EXPECTED FROM ALL THAT WE HAD HEARD TO SEE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
BUT I CAN NEVER FORGET THE EFFECT WHICH MISS DUNBAR PRODUCED UPON ME
IT WAS NO WONDER THAT EVEN THE MASTERFUL MILLIONAIRE HAD FOUND IN HER
SOMETHING MORE POWERFUL THAN HIMSELFSOMETHING WHICH COULD CONTROL
AND GUIDE HIM ONE FELT TOO AS ONE LOOKED AT THE STRONG CLEARCUT
AND YET SENSITIVE FACE THAT EVEN SHOULD SHE BE CAPABLE OF SOME
IMPETUOUS DEED NONE THE LESS THERE WAS AN INNATE NOBILITY OF
CHARACTER WHICH WOULD MAKE HER INFLUENCE ALWAYS FOR THE GOOD SHE WAS
A BRUNETTE TALL WITH A NOBLE FIGURE AND COMMANDING PRESENCE BUT
HER DARK EYES HAD IN THEM THE APPEALING HELPLESS EXPRESSION OF THE
HUNTED CREATURE WHO FEELS THE NETS AROUND IT BUT CAN SEE NO WAY OUT
FROM THE TOILS NOW AS SHE REALIZED THE PRESENCE AND THE HELP OF MY
FAMOUS FRIEND THERE CAME A TOUCH OF COLOUR IN HER WAN CHEEKS AND A
LIGHT OF HOPE BEGAN TO GLIMMER IN THE GLANCE WHICH SHE TURNED UPON
US
PERHAPS MR NEIL GIBSON HAS TOLD YOU SOMETHING OF WHAT OCCURRED
BETWEEN US SHE ASKED IN A LOW AGITATED VOICE
YES HOLMES ANSWERED YOU NEED NOT PAIN YOURSELF BY ENTERING INTO
THAT PART OF THE STORY AFTER SEEING YOU I AM PREPARED TO ACCEPT MR
GIBSONS STATEMENT BOTH AS TO THE INFLUENCE WHICH YOU HAD OVER HIM
AND AS TO THE INNOCENCE OF YOUR RELATIONS WITH HIM BUT WHY WAS THE
WHOLE SITUATION NOT BROUGHT OUT IN COURT
IT SEEMED TO ME INCREDIBLE THAT SUCH A CHARGE COULD BE SUSTAINED I
THOUGHT THAT IF WE WAITED THE WHOLE THING MUST CLEAR ITSELF UP
WITHOUT OUR BEING COMPELLED TO ENTER INTO PAINFUL DETAILS OF THE
INNER LIFE OF THE FAMILY BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT FAR FROM CLEARING IT
HAS BECOME EVEN MORE SERIOUS
MY DEAR YOUNG LADY CRIED HOLMES EARNESTLY I BEG YOU TO HAVE NO
ILLUSIONS UPON THE POINT MR CUMMINGS HERE WOULD ASSURE YOU THAT ALL
THE CARDS ARE AT PRESENT AGAINST US AND THAT WE MUST DO EVERYTHING
THAT IS POSSIBLE IF WE ARE TO WIN CLEAR IT WOULD BE A CRUEL
DECEPTION TO PRETEND THAT YOU ARE NOT IN VERY GREAT DANGER GIVE ME
ALL THE HELP YOU CAN THEN TO GET AT THE TRUTH
I WILL CONCEAL NOTHING
TELL US THEN OF YOUR TRUE RELATIONS WITH MR GIBSONS WIFE
SHE HATED ME MR HOLMES SHE HATED ME WITH ALL THE FERVOUR OF HER
TROPICAL NATURE SHE WAS A WOMAN WHO WOULD DO NOTHING BY HALVES AND
THE MEASURE OF HER LOVE FOR HER HUSBAND WAS THE MEASURE ALSO OF HER
HATRED FOR ME IT IS PROBABLE THAT SHE MISUNDERSTOOD OUR RELATIONS I
WOULD NOT WISH TO WRONG HER BUT SHE LOVED SO VIVIDLY IN A PHYSICAL
SENSE THAT SHE COULD HARDLY UNDERSTAND THE MENTAL AND EVEN
SPIRITUAL TIE WHICH HELD HER HUSBAND TO ME OR IMAGINE THAT IT WAS
ONLY MY DESIRE TO INFLUENCE HIS POWER TO GOOD ENDS WHICH KEPT ME
UNDER HIS ROOF I CAN SEE NOW THAT I WAS WRONG NOTHING COULD JUSTIFY
ME IN REMAINING WHERE I WAS A CAUSE OF UNHAPPINESS AND YET IT IS
CERTAIN THAT THE UNHAPPINESS WOULD HAVE REMAINED EVEN IF I HAD LEFT
THE HOUSE
NOW MISS DUNBAR SAID HOLMES I BEG YOU TO TELL US EXACTLY WHAT
OCCURRED THAT EVENING
I CAN TELL YOU THE TRUTH SO FAR AS I KNOW IT MR HOLMES BUT I AM
IN A POSITION TO PROVE NOTHING AND THERE ARE POINTSTHE MOST VITAL
POINTSWHICH I CAN NEITHER EXPLAIN NOR CAN I IMAGINE ANY
EXPLANATION
IF YOU WILL FIND THE FACTS PERHAPS OTHERS MAY FIND THE
EXPLANATION
WITH REGARD THEN TO MY PRESENCE AT THOR BRIDGE THAT NIGHT I
RECEIVED A NOTE FROM MRS GIBSON IN THE MORNING IT LAY ON THE TABLE
OF THE SCHOOLROOM AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN LEFT THERE BY HER OWN HAND
IT IMPLORED ME TO SEE HER THERE AFTER DINNER SAID SHE HAD SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO SAY TO ME AND ASKED ME TO LEAVE AN ANSWER ON THE
SUNDIAL IN THE GARDEN AS SHE DESIRED NO ONE TO BE IN OUR CONFIDENCE
I SAW NO REASON FOR SUCH SECRECY BUT I DID AS SHE ASKED ACCEPTING
THE APPOINTMENT SHE ASKED ME TO DESTROY HER NOTE AND I BURNED IT IN
THE SCHOOLROOM GRATE SHE WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF HER HUSBAND WHO
TREATED HER WITH A HARSHNESS FOR WHICH I FREQUENTLY REPROACHED HIM
AND I COULD ONLY IMAGINE THAT SHE ACTED IN THIS WAY BECAUSE SHE DID
NOT WISH HIM TO KNOW OF OUR INTERVIEW
YET SHE KEPT YOUR REPLY VERY CAREFULLY
YES I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT SHE HAD IT IN HER HAND WHEN SHE
DIED
WELL WHAT HAPPENED THEN
I WENT DOWN AS I HAD PROMISED WHEN I REACHED THE BRIDGE SHE WAS
WAITING FOR ME NEVER DID I REALIZE TILL THAT MOMENT HOW THIS POOR
CREATURE HATED ME SHE WAS LIKE A MAD WOMANINDEED I THINK SHE WAS
A MAD WOMAN SUBTLY MAD WITH THE DEEP POWER OF DECEPTION WHICH INSANE
PEOPLE MAY HAVE HOW ELSE COULD SHE HAVE MET ME WITH UNCONCERN EVERY
DAY AND YET HAD SO RAGING A HATRED OF ME IN HER HEART I WILL NOT SAY
WHAT SHE SAID SHE POURED HER WHOLE WILD FURY OUT IN BURNING AND
HORRIBLE WORDS I DID NOT EVEN ANSWERI COULD NOT IT WAS DREADFUL
TO SEE HER I PUT MY HANDS TO MY EARS AND RUSHED AWAY WHEN I LEFT
HER SHE WAS STANDING STILL SHRIEKING OUT HER CURSES AT ME IN THE
MOUTH OF THE BRIDGE
WHERE SHE WAS AFTERWARDS FOUND
WITHIN A FEW YARDS FROM THE SPOT
AND YET PRESUMING THAT SHE MET HER DEATH SHORTLY AFTER YOU LEFT
HER YOU HEARD NO SHOT
NO I HEARD NOTHING BUT INDEED MR HOLMES I WAS SO AGITATED AND
HORRIFIED BY THIS TERRIBLE OUTBREAK THAT I RUSHED TO GET BACK TO THE
PEACE OF MY OWN ROOM AND I WAS INCAPABLE OF NOTICING ANYTHING WHICH
HAPPENED
YOU SAY THAT YOU RETURNED TO YOUR ROOM DID YOU LEAVE IT AGAIN
BEFORE NEXT MORNING
YES WHEN THE ALARM CAME THAT THE POOR CREATURE HAD MET HER DEATH I
RAN OUT WITH THE OTHERS
DID YOU SEE MR GIBSON
YES HE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM THE BRIDGE WHEN I SAW HIM HE HAD
SENT FOR THE DOCTOR AND THE POLICE
DID HE SEEM TO YOU MUCH PERTURBED
MR GIBSON IS A VERY STRONG SELFCONTAINED MAN I DO NOT THINK THAT
HE WOULD EVER SHOW HIS EMOTIONS ON THE SURFACE BUT I WHO KNEW HIM
SO WELL COULD SEE THAT HE WAS DEEPLY CONCERNED
THEN WE COME TO THE ALLIMPORTANT POINT THIS PISTOL THAT WAS FOUND
IN YOUR ROOM HAD YOU EVER SEEN IT BEFORE
NEVER I SWEAR IT
WHEN WAS IT FOUND
NEXT MORNING WHEN THE POLICE MADE THEIR SEARCH
AMONG YOUR CLOTHES
YES ON THE FLOOR OF MY WARDROBE UNDER MY DRESSES
YOU COULD NOT GUESS HOW LONG IT HAD BEEN THERE
IT HAD NOT BEEN THERE THE MORNING BEFORE
HOW DO YOU KNOW
BECAUSE I TIDIED OUT THE WARDROBE
THAT IS FINAL THEN SOMEONE CAME INTO YOUR ROOM AND PLACED THE
PISTOL THERE IN ORDER TO INCULPATE YOU
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO
AND WHEN
IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN AT MEALTIME OR ELSE AT THE HOURS WHEN I
WOULD BE IN THE SCHOOLROOM WITH THE CHILDREN
AS YOU WERE WHEN YOU GOT THE NOTE
YES FROM THAT TIME ONWARD FOR THE WHOLE MORNING
THANK YOU MISS DUNBAR IS THERE ANY OTHER POINT WHICH COULD HELP ME
IN THE INVESTIGATION
I CAN THINK OF NONE
THERE WAS SOME SIGN OF VIOLENCE ON THE STONEWORK OF THE BRIDGEA
PERFECTLY FRESH CHIP JUST OPPOSITE THE BODY COULD YOU SUGGEST ANY
POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF THAT
SURELY IT MUST BE A MERE COINCIDENCE
CURIOUS MISS DUNBAR VERY CURIOUS WHY SHOULD IT APPEAR AT THE VERY
TIME OF THE TRAGEDY AND WHY AT THE VERY PLACE
BUT WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED IT ONLY GREAT VIOLENCE COULD HAVE SUCH
AN EFFECT
HOLMES DID NOT ANSWER HIS PALE EAGER FACE HAD SUDDENLY ASSUMED THAT
TENSE FARAWAY EXPRESSION WHICH I HAD LEARNED TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE
SUPREME MANIFESTATIONS OF HIS GENIUS SO EVIDENT WAS THE CRISIS IN
HIS MIND THAT NONE OF US DARED TO SPEAK AND WE SAT BARRISTER
PRISONER AND MYSELF WATCHING HIM IN A CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED
SILENCE SUDDENLY HE SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR VIBRATING WITH NERVOUS
ENERGY AND THE PRESSING NEED FOR ACTION
COME WATSON COME HE CRIED
WHAT IS IT MR HOLMES
NEVER MIND MY DEAR LADY YOU WILL HEAR FROM ME MR CUMMINGS WITH
THE HELP OF THE GOD OF JUSTICE I WILL GIVE YOU A CASE WHICH WILL MAKE
ENGLAND RING YOU WILL GET NEWS BY TOMORROW MISS DUNBAR AND
MEANWHILE TAKE MY ASSURANCE THAT THE CLOUDS ARE LIFTING AND THAT I
HAVE EVERY HOPE THAT THE LIGHT OF TRUTH IS BREAKING THROUGH
IT WAS NOT A LONG JOURNEY FROM WINCHESTER TO THOR PLACE BUT IT WAS
LONG TO ME IN MY IMPATIENCE WHILE FOR HOLMES IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IT
SEEMED ENDLESS FOR IN HIS NERVOUS RESTLESSNESS HE COULD NOT SIT
STILL BUT PACED THE CARRIAGE OR DRUMMED WITH HIS LONG SENSITIVE
FINGERS UPON THE CUSHIONS BESIDE HIM SUDDENLY HOWEVER AS WE NEARED
OUR DESTINATION HE SEATED HIMSELF OPPOSITE TO MEWE HAD A
FIRSTCLASS CARRIAGE TO OURSELVESAND LAYING A HAND UPON EACH OF MY
KNEES HE LOOKED INTO MY EYES WITH THE PECULIARLY MISCHIEVOUS GAZE
WHICH WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS MORE IMPLIKE MOODS
WATSON SAID HE I HAVE SOME RECOLLECTION THAT YOU GO ARMED UPON
THESE EXCURSIONS OF OURS
IT WAS AS WELL FOR HIM THAT I DID SO FOR HE TOOK LITTLE CARE FOR HIS
OWN SAFETY WHEN HIS MIND WAS ONCE ABSORBED BY A PROBLEM SO THAT MORE
THAN ONCE MY REVOLVER HAD BEEN A GOOD FRIEND IN NEED I REMINDED HIM
OF THE FACT
YES YES I AM A LITTLE ABSENTMINDED IN SUCH MATTERS BUT HAVE YOU
YOUR REVOLVER ON YOU
I PRODUCED IT FROM MY HIPPOCKET A SHORT HANDY BUT VERY
SERVICEABLE LITTLE WEAPON HE UNDID THE CATCH SHOOK OUT THE
CARTRIDGES AND EXAMINED IT WITH CARE
ITS HEAVYREMARKABLY HEAVY SAID HE
YES IT IS A SOLID BIT OF WORK
HE MUSED OVER IT FOR A MINUTE
DO YOU KNOW WATSON SAID HE I BELIEVE YOUR REVOLVER IS GOING TO
HAVE A VERY INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH THE MYSTERY WHICH WE ARE
INVESTIGATING
MY DEAR HOLMES YOU ARE JOKING
NO WATSON I AM VERY SERIOUS THERE IS A TEST BEFORE US IF THE
TEST COMES OFF ALL WILL BE CLEAR AND THE TEST WILL DEPEND UPON THE
CONDUCT OF THIS LITTLE WEAPON ONE CARTRIDGE OUT NOW WE WILL REPLACE
THE OTHER FIVE AND PUT ON THE SAFETYCATCH SO THAT INCREASES THE
WEIGHT AND MAKES IT A BETTER REPRODUCTION
I HAD NO GLIMMER OF WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND NOR DID HE ENLIGHTEN ME
BUT SAT LOST IN THOUGHT UNTIL WE PULLED UP IN THE LITTLE HAMPSHIRE
STATION WE SECURED A RAMSHACKLE TRAP AND IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
WERE AT THE HOUSE OF OUR CONFIDENTIAL FRIEND THE SERGEANT
A CLUE MR HOLMES WHAT IS IT
IT ALL DEPENDS UPON THE BEHAVIOUR OF DR WATSONS REVOLVER SAID MY
FRIEND HERE IT IS NOW OFFICER CAN YOU GIVE ME TEN YARDS OF
STRING
THE VILLAGE SHOP PROVIDED A BALL OF STOUT TWINE
I THINK THAT THIS IS ALL WE WILL NEED SAID HOLMES NOW IF YOU
PLEASE WE WILL GET OFF ON WHAT I HOPE IS THE LAST STAGE OF OUR
JOURNEY
THE SUN WAS SETTING AND TURNING THE ROLLING HAMPSHIRE MOOR INTO A
WONDERFUL AUTUMNAL PANORAMA THE SERGEANT WITH MANY CRITICAL AND
INCREDULOUS GLANCES WHICH SHOWED HIS DEEP DOUBTS OF THE SANITY OF MY
COMPANION LURCHED ALONG BESIDE US AS WE APPROACHED THE SCENE OF THE
CRIME I COULD SEE THAT MY FRIEND UNDER ALL HIS HABITUAL COOLNESS WAS
IN TRUTH DEEPLY AGITATED
YES HE SAID IN ANSWER TO MY REMARK YOU HAVE SEEN ME MISS MY MARK
BEFORE WATSON I HAVE AN INSTINCT FOR SUCH THINGS AND YET IT HAS
SOMETIMES PLAYED ME FALSE IT SEEMED A CERTAINTY WHEN FIRST IT
FLASHED ACROSS MY MIND IN THE CELL AT WINCHESTER BUT ONE DRAWBACK OF
AN ACTIVE MIND IS THAT ONE CAN ALWAYS CONCEIVE ALTERNATIVE
EXPLANATIONS WHICH WOULD MAKE OUR SCENT A FALSE ONE AND YETAND
YET WELL WATSON WE CAN BUT TRY
AS HE WALKED HE HAD FIRMLY TIED ONE END OF THE STRING TO THE HANDLE
OF THE REVOLVER WE HAD NOW REACHED THE SCENE OF THE TRAGEDY WITH
GREAT CARE HE MARKED OUT UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE POLICEMAN THE
EXACT SPOT WHERE THE BODY HAD BEEN STRETCHED HE THEN HUNTED AMONG
THE HEATHER AND THE FERNS UNTIL HE FOUND A CONSIDERABLE STONE THIS
HE SECURED TO THE OTHER END OF HIS LINE OF STRING AND HE HUNG IT
OVER THE PARAPET OF THE BRIDGE SO THAT IT SWUNG CLEAR ABOVE THE
WATER HE THEN STOOD ON THE FATAL SPOT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE EDGE
OF THE BRIDGE WITH MY REVOLVER IN HIS HAND THE STRING BEING TAUT
BETWEEN THE WEAPON AND THE HEAVY STONE ON THE FARTHER SIDE
NOW FOR IT HE CRIED
AT THE WORDS HE RAISED THE PISTOL TO HIS HEAD AND THEN LET GO HIS
GRIP IN AN INSTANT IT HAD BEEN WHISKED AWAY BY THE WEIGHT OF THE
STONE HAD STRUCK WITH A SHARP CRACK AGAINST THE PARAPET AND HAD
VANISHED OVER THE SIDE INTO THE WATER IT HAD HARDLY GONE BEFORE
HOLMES WAS KNEELING BESIDE THE STONEWORK AND A JOYOUS CRY SHOWED
THAT HE HAD FOUND WHAT HE EXPECTED
WAS THERE EVER A MORE EXACT DEMONSTRATION HE CRIED SEE WATSON
YOUR REVOLVER HAS SOLVED THE PROBLEM AS HE SPOKE HE POINTED TO A
SECOND CHIP OF THE EXACT SIZE AND SHAPE OF THE FIRST WHICH HAD
APPEARED ON THE UNDER EDGE OF THE STONE BALUSTRADE
WELL STAY AT THE INN TONIGHT HE CONTINUED AS HE ROSE AND FACED
THE ASTONISHED SERGEANT YOU WILL OF COURSE GET A GRAPPLINGHOOK
AND YOU WILL EASILY RESTORE MY FRIENDS REVOLVER YOU WILL ALSO FIND
BESIDE IT THE REVOLVER STRING AND WEIGHT WITH WHICH THIS VINDICTIVE
WOMAN ATTEMPTED TO DISGUISE HER OWN CRIME AND TO FASTEN A CHARGE OF
MURDER UPON AN INNOCENT VICTIM YOU CAN LET MR GIBSON KNOW THAT I
WILL SEE HIM IN THE MORNING WHEN STEPS CAN BE TAKEN FOR MISS
DUNBARS VINDICATION
LATE THAT EVENING AS WE SAT TOGETHER SMOKING OUR PIPES IN THE
VILLAGE INN HOLMES GAVE ME A BRIEF REVIEW OF WHAT HAD PASSED
I FEAR WATSON SAID HE THAT YOU WILL NOT IMPROVE ANY REPUTATION
WHICH I MAY HAVE ACQUIRED BY ADDING THE CASE OF THE THOR BRIDGE
MYSTERY TO YOUR ANNALS I HAVE BEEN SLUGGISH IN MIND AND WANTING IN
THAT MIXTURE OF IMAGINATION AND REALITY WHICH IS THE BASIS OF MY ART
I CONFESS THAT THE CHIP IN THE STONEWORK WAS A SUFFICIENT CLUE TO
SUGGEST THE TRUE SOLUTION AND THAT I BLAME MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING
ATTAINED IT SOONER
IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THE WORKINGS OF THIS UNHAPPY WOMANS MIND
WERE DEEP AND SUBTLE SO THAT IT WAS NO VERY SIMPLE MATTER TO UNRAVEL
HER PLOT I DO NOT THINK THAT IN OUR ADVENTURES WE HAVE EVER COME
ACROSS A STRANGER EXAMPLE OF WHAT PERVERTED LOVE CAN BRING ABOUT
WHETHER MISS DUNBAR WAS HER RIVAL IN A PHYSICAL OR IN A MERELY MENTAL
SENSE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN EQUALLY UNFORGIVABLE IN HER EYES NO DOUBT
SHE BLAMED THIS INNOCENT LADY FOR ALL THOSE HARSH DEALINGS AND UNKIND
WORDS WITH WHICH HER HUSBAND TRIED TO REPEL HER TOO DEMONSTRATIVE
AFFECTION HER FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO END HER OWN LIFE HER SECOND
WAS TO DO IT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO INVOLVE HER VICTIM IN A FATE WHICH
WAS WORSE FAR THAN ANY SUDDEN DEATH COULD BE
WE CAN FOLLOW THE VARIOUS STEPS QUITE CLEARLY AND THEY SHOW A
REMARKABLE SUBTLETY OF MIND A NOTE WAS EXTRACTED VERY CLEVERLY FROM
MISS DUNBAR WHICH WOULD MAKE IT APPEAR THAT SHE HAD CHOSEN THE SCENE
OF THE CRIME IN HER ANXIETY THAT IT SHOULD BE DISCOVERED SHE
SOMEWHAT OVERDID IT BY HOLDING IT IN HER HAND TO THE LAST THIS ALONE
SHOULD HAVE EXCITED MY SUSPICIONS EARLIER THAN IT DID
THEN SHE TOOK ONE OF HER HUSBANDS REVOLVERSTHERE WAS AS YOU SAW
AN ARSENAL IN THE HOUSEAND KEPT IT FOR HER OWN USE A SIMILAR ONE
SHE CONCEALED THAT MORNING IN MISS DUNBARS WARDROBE AFTER
DISCHARGING ONE BARREL WHICH SHE COULD EASILY DO IN THE WOODS
WITHOUT ATTRACTING ATTENTION SHE THEN WENT DOWN TO THE BRIDGE WHERE
SHE HAD CONTRIVED THIS EXCEEDINGLY INGENIOUS METHOD FOR GETTING RID
OF HER WEAPON WHEN MISS DUNBAR APPEARED SHE USED HER LAST BREATH IN
POURING OUT HER HATRED AND THEN WHEN SHE WAS OUT OF HEARING
CARRIED OUT HER TERRIBLE PURPOSE EVERY LINK IS NOW IN ITS PLACE AND
THE CHAIN IS COMPLETE THE PAPERS MAY ASK WHY THE MERE WAS NOT
DRAGGED IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BUT IT IS EASY TO BE WISE AFTER THE
EVENT AND IN ANY CASE THE EXPANSE OF A REEDFILLED LAKE IS NO EASY
MATTER TO DRAG UNLESS YOU HAVE A CLEAR PERCEPTION OF WHAT YOU ARE
LOOKING FOR AND WHERE WELL WATSON WE HAVE HELPED A REMARKABLE
WOMAN AND ALSO A FORMIDABLE MAN SHOULD THEY IN THE FUTURE JOIN
THEIR FORCES AS SEEMS NOT UNLIKELY THE FINANCIAL WORLD MAY FIND
THAT MR NEIL GIBSON HAS LEARNED SOMETHING IN THAT SCHOOLROOM OF
SORROW WHERE OUR EARTHLY LESSONS ARE TAUGHT
THE ADVENTURE OF THE CREEPING MAN
MR SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS ALWAYS OF OPINION THAT I SHOULD PUBLISH THE
SINGULAR FACTS CONNECTED WITH PROFESSOR PRESBURY IF ONLY TO DISPEL
ONCE FOR ALL THE UGLY RUMOURS WHICH SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO AGITATED
THE UNIVERSITY AND WERE ECHOED IN THE LEARNED SOCIETIES OF LONDON
THERE WERE HOWEVER CERTAIN OBSTACLES IN THE WAY AND THE TRUE
HISTORY OF THIS CURIOUS CASE REMAINED ENTOMBED IN THE TIN BOX WHICH
CONTAINS SO MANY RECORDS OF MY FRIENDS ADVENTURES NOW WE HAVE AT
LAST OBTAINED PERMISSION TO VENTILATE THE FACTS WHICH FORMED ONE OF
THE VERY LAST CASES HANDLED BY HOLMES BEFORE HIS RETIREMENT FROM
PRACTICE EVEN NOW A CERTAIN RETICENCE AND DISCRETION HAVE TO BE
OBSERVED IN LAYING THE MATTER BEFORE THE PUBLIC
IT WAS ONE SUNDAY EVENING EARLY IN SEPTEMBER OF THE YEAR THAT I
RECEIVED ONE OF HOLMESS LACONIC MESSAGES
COME AT ONCE IF CONVENIENTIF INCONVENIENT COME ALL THE SAME
S H
THE RELATIONS BETWEEN US IN THOSE LATTER DAYS WERE PECULIAR HE WAS A
MAN OF HABITS NARROW AND CONCENTRATED HABITS AND I HAD BECOME ONE
OF THEM AS AN INSTITUTION I WAS LIKE THE VIOLIN THE SHAG TOBACCO
THE OLD BLACK PIPE THE INDEX BOOKS AND OTHERS PERHAPS LESS
EXCUSABLE WHEN IT WAS A CASE OF ACTIVE WORK AND A COMRADE WAS NEEDED
UPON WHOSE NERVE HE COULD PLACE SOME RELIANCE MY ROLE WAS OBVIOUS
BUT APART FROM THIS I HAD USES I WAS A WHETSTONE FOR HIS MIND I
STIMULATED HIM HE LIKED TO THINK ALOUD IN MY PRESENCE HIS REMARKS
COULD HARDLY BE SAID TO BE MADE TO MEMANY OF THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
AS APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED TO HIS BEDSTEADBUT NONE THE LESS HAVING
FORMED THE HABIT IT HAD BECOME IN SOME WAY HELPFUL THAT I SHOULD
REGISTER AND INTERJECT IF I IRRITATED HIM BY A CERTAIN METHODICAL
SLOWNESS IN MY MENTALITY THAT IRRITATION SERVED ONLY TO MAKE HIS OWN
FLAMELIKE INTUITIONS AND IMPRESSIONS FLASH UP THE MORE VIVIDLY AND
SWIFTLY SUCH WAS MY HUMBLE ROLE IN OUR ALLIANCE
WHEN I ARRIVED AT BAKER STREET I FOUND HIM HUDDLED UP IN HIS ARMCHAIR
WITH UPDRAWN KNEES HIS PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND HIS BROW FURROWED WITH
THOUGHT IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE WAS IN THE THROES OF SOME VEXATIOUS
PROBLEM WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND HE INDICATED MY OLD ARMCHAIR BUT
OTHERWISE FOR HALF AN HOUR HE GAVE NO SIGN THAT HE WAS AWARE OF MY
PRESENCE THEN WITH A START HE SEEMED TO COME FROM HIS REVERIE AND
WITH HIS USUAL WHIMSICAL SMILE HE GREETED ME BACK TO WHAT HAD ONCE
BEEN MY HOME
YOU WILL EXCUSE A CERTAIN ABSTRACTION OF MIND MY DEAR WATSON SAID
HE SOME CURIOUS FACTS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO ME WITHIN THE LAST
TWENTYFOUR HOURS AND THEY IN TURN HAVE GIVEN RISE TO SOME
SPECULATIONS OF A MORE GENERAL CHARACTER I HAVE SERIOUS THOUGHTS OF
WRITING A SMALL MONOGRAPH UPON THE USES OF DOGS IN THE WORK OF THE
DETECTIVE
BUT SURELY HOLMES THIS HAS BEEN EXPLORED SAID I
BLOODHOUNDSSLEUTHHOUNDS
NO NO WATSON THAT SIDE OF THE MATTER IS OF COURSE OBVIOUS BUT
THERE IS ANOTHER WHICH IS FAR MORE SUBTLE YOU MAY RECOLLECT THAT IN
THE CASE WHICH YOU IN YOUR SENSATIONAL WAY COUPLED WITH THE COPPER
BEECHES I WAS ABLE BY WATCHING THE MIND OF THE CHILD TO FORM A
DEDUCTION AS TO THE CRIMINAL HABITS OF THE VERY SMUG AND RESPECTABLE
FATHER
YES I REMEMBER IT WELL
MY LINE OF THOUGHTS ABOUT DOGS IS ANALOGOUS A DOG REFLECTS THE
FAMILY LIFE WHOEVER SAW A FRISKY DOG IN A GLOOMY FAMILY OR A SAD
DOG IN A HAPPY ONE SNARLING PEOPLE HAVE SNARLING DOGS DANGEROUS
PEOPLE HAVE DANGEROUS ONES AND THEIR PASSING MOODS MAY REFLECT THE
PASSING MOODS OF OTHERS
I SHOOK MY HEAD SURELY HOLMES THIS IS A LITTLE FARFETCHED SAID
I
HE HAD REFILLED HIS PIPE AND RESUMED HIS SEAT TAKING NO NOTICE OF MY
COMMENT
THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF WHAT I HAVE SAID IS VERY CLOSE TO THE
PROBLEM WHICH I AM INVESTIGATING IT IS A TANGLED SKEIN YOU
UNDERSTAND AND I AM LOOKING FOR A LOOSE END ONE POSSIBLE LOOSE END
LIES IN THE QUESTION WHY DOES PROFESSOR PRESBURYS WOLFHOUND ROY
ENDEAVOUR TO BITE HIM
I SANK BACK IN MY CHAIR IN SOME DISAPPOINTMENT WAS IT FOR SO TRIVIAL
A QUESTION AS THIS THAT I HAD BEEN SUMMONED FROM MY WORK HOLMES
GLANCED ACROSS AT ME
THE SAME OLD WATSON SAID HE YOU NEVER LEARN THAT THE GRAVEST
ISSUES MAY DEPEND UPON THE SMALLEST THINGS BUT IS IT NOT ON THE FACE
OF IT STRANGE THAT A STAID ELDERLY PHILOSOPHERYOUVE HEARD OF
PRESBURY OF COURSE THE FAMOUS CAMFORD PHYSIOLOGISTTHAT SUCH A
MAN WHOSE FRIEND HAS BEEN HIS DEVOTED WOLFHOUND SHOULD NOW HAVE
BEEN TWICE ATTACKED BY HIS OWN DOG WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
THE DOG IS ILL
WELL THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED BUT HE ATTACKS NO ONE ELSE NOR
DOES HE APPARENTLY MOLEST HIS MASTER SAVE ON VERY SPECIAL OCCASIONS
CURIOUS WATSONVERY CURIOUS BUT YOUNG MR BENNETT IS BEFORE HIS
TIME IF THAT IS HIS RING I HAD HOPED TO HAVE A LONGER CHAT WITH YOU
BEFORE HE CAME
THERE WAS A QUICK STEP ON THE STAIRS A SHARP TAP AT THE DOOR AND A
MOMENT LATER THE NEW CLIENT PRESENTED HIMSELF HE WAS A TALL
HANDSOME YOUTH ABOUT THIRTY WELL DRESSED AND ELEGANT BUT WITH
SOMETHING IN HIS BEARING WHICH SUGGESTED THE SHYNESS OF THE STUDENT
RATHER THAN THE SELFPOSSESSION OF THE MAN OF THE WORLD HE SHOOK
HANDS WITH HOLMES AND THEN LOOKED WITH SOME SURPRISE AT ME
THIS MATTER IS VERY DELICATE MR HOLMES HE SAID CONSIDER THE
RELATION IN WHICH I STAND TO PROFESSOR PRESBURY BOTH PRIVATELY AND
PUBLICLY I REALLY CAN HARDLY JUSTIFY MYSELF IF I SPEAK BEFORE ANY
THIRD PERSON
HAVE NO FEAR MR BENNETT DR WATSON IS THE VERY SOUL OF
DISCRETION AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS A MATTER IN WHICH I AM
VERY LIKELY TO NEED AN ASSISTANT
AS YOU LIKE MR HOLMES YOU WILL I AM SURE UNDERSTAND MY HAVING
SOME RESERVES IN THE MATTER
YOU WILL APPRECIATE IT WATSON WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THIS GENTLEMAN
MR TREVOR BENNETT IS PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANT TO THE GREAT SCIENTIST
LIVES UNDER HIS ROOF AND IS ENGAGED TO HIS ONLY DAUGHTER CERTAINLY
WE MUST AGREE THAT THE PROFESSOR HAS EVERY CLAIM UPON HIS LOYALTY AND
DEVOTION BUT IT MAY BEST BE SHOWN BY TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS TO
CLEAR UP THIS STRANGE MYSTERY
I HOPE SO MR HOLMES THAT IS MY ONE OBJECT DOES DR WATSON KNOW
THE SITUATION
I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO EXPLAIN IT
THEN PERHAPS I HAD BETTER GO OVER THE GROUND AGAIN BEFORE EXPLAINING
SOME FRESH DEVELOPMENTS
I WILL DO SO MYSELF SAID HOLMES IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT I HAVE THE
EVENTS IN THEIR DUE ORDER THE PROFESSOR WATSON IS A MAN OF
EUROPEAN REPUTATION HIS LIFE HAS BEEN ACADEMIC THERE HAS NEVER BEEN
A BREATH OF SCANDAL HE IS A WIDOWER WITH ONE DAUGHTER EDITH HE IS
I GATHER A MAN OF VERY VIRILE AND POSITIVE ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY
COMBATIVE CHARACTER SO THE MATTER STOOD UNTIL A VERY FEW MONTHS
AGO
THEN THE CURRENT OF HIS LIFE WAS BROKEN HE IS SIXTYONE YEARS OF
AGE BUT HE BECAME ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF PROFESSOR MORPHY HIS
COLLEAGUE IN THE CHAIR OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY IT WAS NOT AS I
UNDERSTAND THE REASONED COURTING OF AN ELDERLY MAN BUT RATHER THE
PASSIONATE FRENZY OF YOUTH FOR NO ONE COULD HAVE SHOWN HIMSELF A
MORE DEVOTED LOVER THE LADY ALICE MORPHY WAS A VERY PERFECT GIRL
BOTH IN MIND AND BODY SO THAT THERE WAS EVERY EXCUSE FOR THE
PROFESSORS INFATUATION NONE THE LESS IT DID NOT MEET WITH FULL
APPROVAL IN HIS OWN FAMILY
WE THOUGHT IT RATHER EXCESSIVE SAID OUR VISITOR
EXACTLY EXCESSIVE AND A LITTLE VIOLENT AND UNNATURAL PROFESSOR
PRESBURY WAS RICH HOWEVER AND THERE WAS NO OBJECTION UPON THE PART
OF THE FATHER THE DAUGHTER HOWEVER HAD OTHER VIEWS AND THERE WERE
ALREADY SEVERAL CANDIDATES FOR HER HAND WHO IF THEY WERE LESS
ELIGIBLE FROM A WORLDLY POINT OF VIEW WERE AT LEAST MORE OF AN AGE
THE GIRL SEEMED TO LIKE THE PROFESSOR IN SPITE OF HIS ECCENTRICITIES
IT WAS ONLY AGE WHICH STOOD IN THE WAY
ABOUT THIS TIME A LITTLE MYSTERY SUDDENLY CLOUDED THE NORMAL ROUTINE
OF THE PROFESSORS LIFE HE DID WHAT HE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE HE
LEFT HOME AND GAVE NO INDICATION WHERE HE WAS GOING HE WAS AWAY A
FORTNIGHT AND RETURNED LOOKING RATHER TRAVELWORN HE MADE NO
ALLUSION TO WHERE HE HAD BEEN ALTHOUGH HE WAS USUALLY THE FRANKEST
OF MEN IT CHANCED HOWEVER THAT OUR CLIENT HERE MR BENNETT
RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A FELLOWSTUDENT IN PRAGUE WHO SAID THAT HE
WAS GLAD TO HAVE SEEN PROFESSOR PRESBURY THERE ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT
BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO HIM ONLY IN THIS WAY DID HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD
LEARN WHERE HE HAD BEEN
NOW COMES THE POINT FROM THAT TIME ONWARD A CURIOUS CHANGE CAME
OVER THE PROFESSOR HE BECAME FURTIVE AND SLY THOSE AROUND HIM HAD
ALWAYS THE FEELING THAT HE WAS NOT THE MAN THAT THEY HAD KNOWN BUT
THAT HE WAS UNDER SOME SHADOW WHICH HAD DARKENED HIS HIGHER
QUALITIES HIS INTELLECT WAS NOT AFFECTED HIS LECTURES WERE AS
BRILLIANT AS EVER BUT ALWAYS THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW SOMETHING
SINISTER AND UNEXPECTED HIS DAUGHTER WHO WAS DEVOTED TO HIM TRIED
AGAIN AND AGAIN TO RESUME THE OLD RELATIONS AND TO PENETRATE THIS
MASK WHICH HER FATHER SEEMED TO HAVE PUT ON YOU SIR AS I
UNDERSTAND DID THE SAMEBUT ALL WAS IN VAIN AND NOW MR BENNETT
TELL IN YOUR OWN WORDS THE INCIDENT OF THE LETTERS
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND DR WATSON THAT THE PROFESSOR HAD NO SECRETS
FROM ME IF I WERE HIS SON OR HIS YOUNGER BROTHER I COULD NOT HAVE
MORE COMPLETELY ENJOYED HIS CONFIDENCE AS HIS SECRETARY I HANDLED
EVERY PAPER WHICH CAME TO HIM AND I OPENED AND SUBDIVIDED HIS
LETTERS SHORTLY AFTER HIS RETURN ALL THIS WAS CHANGED HE TOLD ME
THAT CERTAIN LETTERS MIGHT COME TO HIM FROM LONDON WHICH WOULD BE
MARKED BY A CROSS UNDER THE STAMP THESE WERE TO BE SET ASIDE FOR HIS
OWN EYES ONLY I MAY SAY THAT SEVERAL OF THESE DID PASS THROUGH MY
HANDS THAT THEY HAD THE E C MARK AND WERE IN AN ILLITERATE
HANDWRITING IF HE ANSWERED THEM AT ALL THE ANSWERS DID NOT PASS
THROUGH MY HANDS NOR INTO THE LETTERBASKET IN WHICH OUR
CORRESPONDENCE WAS COLLECTED
AND THE BOX SAID HOLMES
AH YES THE BOX THE PROFESSOR BROUGHT BACK A LITTLE WOODEN BOX
FROM HIS TRAVELS IT WAS THE ONE THING WHICH SUGGESTED A CONTINENTAL
TOUR FOR IT WAS ONE OF THOSE QUAINT CARVED THINGS WHICH ONE
ASSOCIATES WITH GERMANY THIS HE PLACED IN HIS INSTRUMENT CUPBOARD
ONE DAY IN LOOKING FOR A CANULA I TOOK UP THE BOX TO MY SURPRISE
HE WAS VERY ANGRY AND REPROVED ME IN WORDS WHICH WERE QUITE SAVAGE
FOR MY CURIOSITY IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SUCH A THING HAD HAPPENED
AND I WAS DEEPLY HURT I ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN THAT IT WAS A MERE
ACCIDENT THAT I HAD TOUCHED THE BOX BUT ALL THE EVENING I WAS
CONSCIOUS THAT HE LOOKED AT ME HARSHLY AND THAT THE INCIDENT WAS
RANKLING IN HIS MIND MR BENNETT DREW A LITTLE DIARY BOOK FROM HIS
POCKET THAT WAS ON JULY D SAID HE
YOU ARE CERTAINLY AN ADMIRABLE WITNESS SAID HOLMES I MAY NEED
SOME OF THESE DATES WHICH YOU HAVE NOTED
I LEARNED METHOD AMONG OTHER THINGS FROM MY GREAT TEACHER FROM THE
TIME THAT I OBSERVED ABNORMALITY IN HIS BEHAVIOUR I FELT THAT IT WAS
MY DUTY TO STUDY HIS CASE THUS I HAVE IT HERE THAT IT WAS ON THAT
VERY DAY JULY D THAT ROY ATTACKED THE PROFESSOR AS HE CAME FROM
HIS STUDY INTO THE HALL AGAIN ON JULY TH THERE WAS A SCENE OF
THE SAME SORT AND THEN I HAVE A NOTE OF YET ANOTHER UPON JULY TH
AFTER THAT WE HAD TO BANISH ROY TO THE STABLES HE WAS A DEAR
AFFECTIONATE ANIMALBUT I FEAR I WEARY YOU
MR BENNETT SPOKE IN A TONE OF REPROACH FOR IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT
HOLMES WAS NOT LISTENING HIS FACE WAS RIGID AND HIS EYES GAZED
ABSTRACTEDLY AT THE CEILING WITH AN EFFORT HE RECOVERED HIMSELF
SINGULAR MOST SINGULAR HE MURMURED THESE DETAILS WERE NEW TO
ME MR BENNETT I THINK WE HAVE NOW FAIRLY GONE OVER THE OLD GROUND
HAVE WE NOT BUT YOU SPOKE OF SOME FRESH DEVELOPMENTS
THE PLEASANT OPEN FACE OF OUR VISITOR CLOUDED OVER SHADOWED BY SOME
GRIM REMEMBRANCE WHAT I SPEAK OF OCCURRED THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST
SAID HE I WAS LYING AWAKE ABOUT TWO IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAS
AWARE OF A DULL MUFFLED SOUND COMING FROM THE PASSAGE I OPENED MY
DOOR AND PEEPED OUT I SHOULD EXPLAIN THAT THE PROFESSOR SLEEPS AT
THE END OF THE PASSAGE
THE DATE BEING ASKED HOLMES
OUR VISITOR WAS CLEARLY ANNOYED AT SO IRRELEVANT AN INTERRUPTION
I HAVE SAID SIR THAT IT WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE LASTTHAT IS
SEPTEMBER TH
HOLMES NODDED AND SMILED
PRAY CONTINUE SAID HE
HE SLEEPS AT THE END OF THE PASSAGE AND WOULD HAVE TO PASS MY DOOR
IN ORDER TO REACH THE STAIRCASE IT WAS A REALLY TERRIFYING
EXPERIENCE MR HOLMES I THINK THAT I AM AS STRONGNERVED AS MY
NEIGHBOURS BUT I WAS SHAKEN BY WHAT I SAW THE PASSAGE WAS DARK SAVE
THAT ONE WINDOW HALFWAY ALONG IT THREW A PATCH OF LIGHT I COULD SEE
THAT SOMETHING WAS COMING ALONG THE PASSAGE SOMETHING DARK AND
CROUCHING THEN SUDDENLY IT EMERGED INTO THE LIGHT AND I SAW THAT IT
WAS HE HE WAS CRAWLING MR HOLMESCRAWLING HE WAS NOT QUITE ON
HIS HANDS AND KNEES I SHOULD RATHER SAY ON HIS HANDS AND FEET WITH
HIS FACE SUNK BETWEEN HIS HANDS YET HE SEEMED TO MOVE WITH EASE I
WAS SO PARALYZED BY THE SIGHT THAT IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE HAD REACHED MY
DOOR THAT I WAS ABLE TO STEP FORWARD AND ASK IF I COULD ASSIST HIM
HIS ANSWER WAS EXTRAORDINARY HE SPRANG UP SPAT OUT SOME ATROCIOUS
WORD AT ME AND HURRIED ON PAST ME AND DOWN THE STAIRCASE I WAITED
ABOUT FOR AN HOUR BUT HE DID NOT COME BACK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
DAYLIGHT BEFORE HE REGAINED HIS ROOM
WELL WATSON WHAT MAKE YOU OF THAT ASKED HOLMES WITH THE AIR OF
THE PATHOLOGIST WHO PRESENTS A RARE SPECIMEN
LUMBAGO POSSIBLY I HAVE KNOWN A SEVERE ATTACK MAKE A MAN WALK IN
JUST SUCH A WAY AND NOTHING WOULD BE MORE TRYING TO THE TEMPER
GOOD WATSON YOU ALWAYS KEEP US FLATFOOTED ON THE GROUND BUT WE
CAN HARDLY ACCEPT LUMBAGO SINCE HE WAS ABLE TO STAND ERECT IN A
MOMENT
HE WAS NEVER BETTER IN HEALTH SAID BENNETT IN FACT HE IS
STRONGER THAN I HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS BUT THERE ARE THE FACTS
MR HOLMES IT IS NOT A CASE IN WHICH WE CAN CONSULT THE POLICE AND
YET WE ARE UTTERLY AT OUR WITS END AS TO WHAT TO DO AND WE FEEL IN
SOME STRANGE WAY THAT WE ARE DRIFTING TOWARDS DISASTER EDITHMISS
PRESBURYFEELS AS I DO THAT WE CANNOT WAIT PASSIVELY ANY LONGER
IT IS CERTAINLY A VERY CURIOUS AND SUGGESTIVE CASE WHAT DO YOU
THINK WATSON
SPEAKING AS A MEDICAL MAN SAID I IT APPEARS TO BE A CASE FOR AN
ALIENIST THE OLD GENTLEMANS CEREBRAL PROCESSES WERE DISTURBED BY
THE LOVE AFFAIR HE MADE A JOURNEY ABROAD IN THE HOPE OF BREAKING
HIMSELF OF THE PASSION HIS LETTERS AND THE BOX MAY BE CONNECTED WITH
SOME OTHER PRIVATE TRANSACTIONA LOAN PERHAPS OR SHARE
CERTIFICATES WHICH ARE IN THE BOX
AND THE WOLFHOUND NO DOUBT DISAPPROVED OF THE FINANCIAL BARGAIN NO
NO WATSON THERE IS MORE IN IT THAN THIS NOW I CAN ONLY SUGGEST
WHAT SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS ABOUT TO SUGGEST WILL NEVER BE KNOWN FOR AT
THIS MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED AND A YOUNG LADY WAS SHOWN INTO THE ROOM
AS SHE APPEARED MR BENNETT SPRANG UP WITH A CRY AND RAN FORWARD WITH
HIS HANDS OUT TO MEET THOSE WHICH SHE HAD HERSELF OUTSTRETCHED
EDITH DEAR NOTHING THE MATTER I HOPE
I FELT I MUST FOLLOW YOU OH JACK I HAVE BEEN SO DREADFULLY
FRIGHTENED IT IS AWFUL TO BE THERE ALONE
MR HOLMES THIS IS THE YOUNG LADY I SPOKE OF THIS IS MY FIANCEE
WE WERE GRADUALLY COMING TO THAT CONCLUSION WERE WE NOT WATSON
HOLMES ANSWERED WITH A SMILE I TAKE IT MISS PRESBURY THAT THERE
IS SOME FRESH DEVELOPMENT IN THE CASE AND THAT YOU THOUGHT WE SHOULD
KNOW
OUR NEW VISITOR A BRIGHT HANDSOME GIRL OF A CONVENTIONAL ENGLISH
TYPE SMILED BACK AT HOLMES AS SHE SEATED HERSELF BESIDE MR BENNETT
WHEN I FOUND MR BENNETT HAD LEFT HIS HOTEL I THOUGHT I SHOULD
PROBABLY FIND HIM HERE OF COURSE HE HAD TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD
CONSULT YOU BUT OH MR HOLMES CAN YOU DO NOTHING FOR MY POOR
FATHER
I HAVE HOPES MISS PRESBURY BUT THE CASE IS STILL OBSCURE PERHAPS
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY MAY THROW SOME FRESH LIGHT UPON IT
IT WAS LAST NIGHT MR HOLMES HE HAD BEEN VERY STRANGE ALL DAY I
AM SURE THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN HE HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HE
DOES HE LIVES AS IN A STRANGE DREAM YESTERDAY WAS SUCH A DAY IT
WAS NOT MY FATHER WITH WHOM I LIVED HIS OUTWARD SHELL WAS THERE BUT
IT WAS NOT REALLY HE
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
I WAS AWAKENED IN THE NIGHT BY THE DOG BARKING MOST FURIOUSLY POOR
ROY HE IS CHAINED NOW NEAR THE STABLE I MAY SAY THAT I ALWAYS SLEEP
WITH MY DOOR LOCKED FOR AS JACKAS MR BENNETTWILL TELL YOU WE
ALL HAVE A FEELING OF IMPENDING DANGER MY ROOM IS ON THE SECOND
FLOOR IT HAPPENED THAT THE BLIND WAS UP IN MY WINDOW AND THERE WAS
BRIGHT MOONLIGHT OUTSIDE AS I LAY WITH MY EYES FIXED UPON THE SQUARE
OF LIGHT LISTENING TO THE FRENZIED BARKINGS OF THE DOG I WAS AMAZED
TO SEE MY FATHERS FACE LOOKING IN AT ME MR HOLMES I NEARLY DIED
OF SURPRISE AND HORROR THERE IT WAS PRESSED AGAINST THE WINDOWPANE
AND ONE HAND SEEMED TO BE RAISED AS IF TO PUSH UP THE WINDOW IF THAT
WINDOW HAD OPENED I THINK I SHOULD HAVE GONE MAD IT WAS NO
DELUSION MR HOLMES DONT DECEIVE YOURSELF BY THINKING SO I DARE
SAY IT WAS TWENTY SECONDS OR SO THAT I LAY PARALYZED AND WATCHED THE
FACE THEN IT VANISHED BUT I COULD NOTI COULD NOT SPRING OUT OF
BED AND LOOK OUT AFTER IT I LAY COLD AND SHIVERING TILL MORNING AT
BREAKFAST HE WAS SHARP AND FIERCE IN MANNER AND MADE NO ALLUSION TO
THE ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT NEITHER DID I BUT I GAVE AN EXCUSE FOR
COMING TO TOWNAND HERE I AM
HOLMES LOOKED THOROUGHLY SURPRISED AT MISS PRESBURYS NARRATIVE
MY DEAR YOUNG LADY YOU SAY THAT YOUR ROOM IS ON THE SECOND FLOOR
IS THERE A LONG LADDER IN THE GARDEN
NO MR HOLMES THAT IS THE AMAZING PART OF IT THERE IS NO POSSIBLE
WAY OF REACHING THE WINDOWAND YET HE WAS THERE
THE DATE BEING SEPTEMBER TH SAID HOLMES THAT CERTAINLY
COMPLICATES MATTERS
IT WAS THE YOUNG LADYS TURN TO LOOK SURPRISED THIS IS THE SECOND
TIME THAT YOU HAVE ALLUDED TO THE DATE MR HOLMES SAID BENNETT
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IT HAS ANY BEARING UPON THE CASE
IT IS POSSIBLEVERY POSSIBLEAND YET I HAVE NOT MY FULL MATERIAL
AT PRESENT
POSSIBLY YOU ARE THINKING OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN INSANITY AND
PHASES OF THE MOON
NO I ASSURE YOU IT WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT LINE OF THOUGHT POSSIBLY
YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR NOTEBOOK WITH ME AND I WILL CHECK THE DATES NOW
I THINK WATSON THAT OUR LINE OF ACTION IS PERFECTLY CLEAR THIS
YOUNG LADY HAS INFORMED USAND I HAVE THE GREATEST CONFIDENCE IN HER
INTUITIONTHAT HER FATHER REMEMBERS LITTLE OR NOTHING WHICH OCCURS
UPON CERTAIN DATES WE WILL THEREFORE CALL UPON HIM AS IF HE HAD
GIVEN US AN APPOINTMENT UPON SUCH A DATE HE WILL PUT IT DOWN TO HIS
OWN LACK OF MEMORY THUS WE WILL OPEN OUR CAMPAIGN BY HAVING A GOOD
CLOSE VIEW OF HIM
THAT IS EXCELLENT SAID MR BENNETT I WARN YOU HOWEVER THAT THE
PROFESSOR IS IRASCIBLE AND VIOLENT AT TIMES
HOLMES SMILED THERE ARE REASONS WHY WE SHOULD COME AT ONCEVERY
COGENT REASONS IF MY THEORIES HOLD GOOD TOMORROW MR BENNETT WILL
CERTAINLY SEE US IN CAMFORD THERE IS IF I REMEMBER RIGHT AN INN
CALLED THE CHEQUERS WHERE THE PORT USED TO BE ABOVE MEDIOCRITY AND
THE LINEN WAS ABOVE REPROACH I THINK WATSON THAT OUR LOT FOR THE
NEXT FEW DAYS MIGHT LIE IN LESS PLEASANT PLACES
MONDAY MORNING FOUND US ON OUR WAY TO THE FAMOUS UNIVERSITY TOWNAN
EASY EFFORT ON THE PART OF HOLMES WHO HAD NO ROOTS TO PULL UP BUT
ONE WHICH INVOLVED FRANTIC PLANNING AND HURRYING ON MY PART AS MY
PRACTICE WAS BY THIS TIME NOT INCONSIDERABLE HOLMES MADE NO ALLUSION
TO THE CASE UNTIL AFTER WE HAD DEPOSITED OUR SUITCASES AT THE ANCIENT
HOSTEL OF WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN
I THINK WATSON THAT WE CAN CATCH THE PROFESSOR JUST BEFORE LUNCH
HE LECTURES AT ELEVEN AND SHOULD HAVE AN INTERVAL AT HOME
WHAT POSSIBLE EXCUSE HAVE WE FOR CALLING
HOLMES GLANCED AT HIS NOTEBOOK
THERE WAS A PERIOD OF EXCITEMENT UPON AUGUST TH WE WILL ASSUME
THAT HE IS A LITTLE HAZY AS TO WHAT HE DOES AT SUCH TIMES IF WE
INSIST THAT WE ARE THERE BY APPOINTMENT I THINK HE WILL HARDLY
VENTURE TO CONTRADICT US HAVE YOU THE EFFRONTERY NECESSARY TO PUT IT
THROUGH
WE CAN BUT TRY
EXCELLENT WATSON COMPOUND OF THE BUSY BEE AND EXCELSIOR WE CAN
BUT TRYTHE MOTTO OF THE FIRM A FRIENDLY NATIVE WILL SURELY GUIDE
US
SUCH A ONE ON THE BACK OF A SMART HANSOM SWEPT US PAST A ROW OF
ANCIENT COLLEGES AND FINALLY TURNING INTO A TREELINED DRIVE PULLED
UP AT THE DOOR OF A CHARMING HOUSE GIRT ROUND WITH LAWNS AND COVERED
WITH PURPLE WISTERIA PROFESSOR PRESBURY WAS CERTAINLY SURROUNDED
WITH EVERY SIGN NOT ONLY OF COMFORT BUT OF LUXURY EVEN AS WE PULLED
UP A GRIZZLED HEAD APPEARED AT THE FRONT WINDOW AND WE WERE AWARE
OF A PAIR OF KEEN EYES FROM UNDER SHAGGY BROWS WHICH SURVEYED US
THROUGH LARGE HORN GLASSES A MOMENT LATER WE WERE ACTUALLY IN HIS
SANCTUM AND THE MYSTERIOUS SCIENTIST WHOSE VAGARIES HAD BROUGHT US
FROM LONDON WAS STANDING BEFORE US THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO SIGN OF
ECCENTRICITY EITHER IN HIS MANNER OR APPEARANCE FOR HE WAS A PORTLY
LARGEFEATURED MAN GRAVE TALL AND FROCKCOATED WITH THE DIGNITY
OF BEARING WHICH A LECTURER NEEDS HIS EYES WERE HIS MOST REMARKABLE
FEATURE KEEN OBSERVANT AND CLEVER TO THE VERGE OF CUNNING
HE LOOKED AT OUR CARDS PRAY SIT DOWN GENTLEMEN WHAT CAN I DO FOR
YOU
MR HOLMES SMILED AMIABLY
IT WAS THE QUESTION WHICH I WAS ABOUT TO PUT TO YOU PROFESSOR
TO ME SIR
POSSIBLY THERE IS SOME MISTAKE I HEARD THROUGH A SECOND PERSON THAT
PROFESSOR PRESBURY OF CAMFORD HAD NEED OF MY SERVICES
OH INDEED IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THERE WAS A MALICIOUS SPARKLE IN
THE INTENSE GRAY EYES YOU HEARD THAT DID YOU MAY I ASK THE NAME
OF YOUR INFORMANT
I AM SORRY PROFESSOR BUT THE MATTER WAS RATHER CONFIDENTIAL IF I
HAVE MADE A MISTAKE THERE IS NO HARM DONE I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY
REGRET
NOT AT ALL I SHOULD WISH TO GO FURTHER INTO THIS MATTER IT
INTERESTS ME HAVE YOU ANY SCRAP OF WRITING ANY LETTER OR TELEGRAM
TO BEAR OUT YOUR ASSERTION
NO I HAVE NOT
I PRESUME THAT YOU DO NOT GO SO FAR AS TO ASSERT THAT I SUMMONED
YOU
I WOULD RATHER ANSWER NO QUESTIONS SAID HOLMES
NO I DARE SAY NOT SAID THE PROFESSOR WITH ASPERITY HOWEVER
THAT PARTICULAR ONE CAN BE ANSWERED VERY EASILY WITHOUT YOUR AID
HE WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM TO THE BELL OUR LONDON FRIEND MR
BENNETT ANSWERED THE CALL
COME IN MR BENNETT THESE TWO GENTLEMEN HAVE COME FROM LONDON
UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SUMMONED YOU HANDLE ALL MY
CORRESPONDENCE HAVE YOU A NOTE OF ANYTHING GOING TO A PERSON NAMED
HOLMES
NO SIR BENNETT ANSWERED WITH A FLUSH
THAT IS CONCLUSIVE SAID THE PROFESSOR GLARING ANGRILY AT MY
COMPANION NOW SIRHE LEANED FORWARD WITH HIS TWO HANDS UPON THE
TABLEIT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOUR POSITION IS A VERY QUESTIONABLE
ONE
HOLMES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
I CAN ONLY REPEAT THAT I AM SORRY THAT WE HAVE MADE A NEEDLESS
INTRUSION
HARDLY ENOUGH MR HOLMES THE OLD MAN CRIED IN A HIGH SCREAMING
VOICE WITH EXTRAORDINARY MALIGNANCY UPON HIS FACE HE GOT BETWEEN US
AND THE DOOR AS HE SPOKE AND HE SHOOK HIS TWO HANDS AT US WITH
FURIOUS PASSION YOU CAN HARDLY GET OUT OF IT SO EASILY AS THAT
HIS FACE WAS CONVULSED AND HE GRINNED AND GIBBERED AT US IN HIS
SENSELESS RAGE I AM CONVINCED THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD TO FIGHT OUR
WAY OUT OF THE ROOM IF MR BENNETT HAD NOT INTERVENED
MY DEAR PROFESSOR HE CRIED CONSIDER YOUR POSITION CONSIDER THE
SCANDAL AT THE UNIVERSITY MR HOLMES IS A WELLKNOWN MAN YOU CANNOT
POSSIBLY TREAT HIM WITH SUCH DISCOURTESY
SULKILY OUR HOSTIF I MAY CALL HIM SOCLEARED THE PATH TO THE DOOR
WE WERE GLAD TO FIND OURSELVES OUTSIDE THE HOUSE AND IN THE QUIET OF
THE TREELINED DRIVE HOLMES SEEMED GREATLY AMUSED BY THE EPISODE
OUR LEARNED FRIENDS NERVES ARE SOMEWHAT OUT OF ORDER SAID HE
PERHAPS OUR INTRUSION WAS A LITTLE CRUDE AND YET WE HAVE GAINED
THAT PERSONAL CONTACT WHICH I DESIRED BUT DEAR ME WATSON HE IS
SURELY AT OUR HEELS THE VILLAIN STILL PURSUES US
THERE WERE THE SOUNDS OF RUNNING FEET BEHIND BUT IT WAS TO MY
RELIEF NOT THE FORMIDABLE PROFESSOR BUT HIS ASSISTANT WHO APPEARED
ROUND THE CURVE OF THE DRIVE HE CAME PANTING UP TO US
I AM SO SORRY MR HOLMES I WISHED TO APOLOGIZE
MY DEAR SIR THERE IS NO NEED IT IS ALL IN THE WAY OF PROFESSIONAL
EXPERIENCE
I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM IN A MORE DANGEROUS MOOD BUT HE GROWS MORE
SINISTER YOU CAN UNDERSTAND NOW WHY HIS DAUGHTER AND I ARE ALARMED
AND YET HIS MIND IS PERFECTLY CLEAR
TOO CLEAR SAID HOLMES THAT WAS MY MISCALCULATION IT IS EVIDENT
THAT HIS MEMORY IS MUCH MORE RELIABLE THAN I HAD THOUGHT BY THE WAY
CAN WE BEFORE WE GO SEE THE WINDOW OF MISS PRESBURYS ROOM
MR BENNETT PUSHED HIS WAY THROUGH SOME SHRUBS AND WE HAD A VIEW OF
THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE
IT IS THERE THE SECOND ON THE LEFT
DEAR ME IT SEEMS HARDLY ACCESSIBLE AND YET YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT
THERE IS A CREEPER BELOW AND A WATERPIPE ABOVE WHICH GIVE SOME
FOOTHOLD
I COULD NOT CLIMB IT MYSELF SAID MR BENNETT
VERY LIKELY IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE A DANGEROUS EXPLOIT FOR ANY
NORMAL MAN
THERE WAS ONE OTHER THING I WISH TO TELL YOU MR HOLMES I HAVE THE
ADDRESS OF THE MAN IN LONDON TO WHOM THE PROFESSOR WRITES HE SEEMS
TO HAVE WRITTEN THIS MORNING AND I GOT IT FROM HIS BLOTTINGPAPER
IT IS AN IGNOBLE POSITION FOR A TRUSTED SECRETARY BUT WHAT ELSE CAN
I DO
HOLMES GLANCED AT THE PAPER AND PUT IT INTO HIS POCKET
DORAKA CURIOUS NAME SLAVONIC I IMAGINE WELL IT IS AN IMPORTANT
LINK IN THE CHAIN WE RETURN TO LONDON THIS AFTERNOON MR BENNETT I
SEE NO GOOD PURPOSE TO BE SERVED BY OUR REMAINING WE CANNOT ARREST
THE PROFESSOR BECAUSE HE HAS DONE NO CRIME NOR CAN WE PLACE HIM
UNDER CONSTRAINT FOR HE CANNOT BE PROVED TO BE MAD NO ACTION IS AS
YET POSSIBLE
THEN WHAT ON EARTH ARE WE TO DO
A LITTLE PATIENCE MR BENNETT THINGS WILL SOON DEVELOP UNLESS I
AM MISTAKEN NEXT TUESDAY MAY MARK A CRISIS CERTAINLY WE SHALL BE IN
CAMFORD ON THAT DAY MEANWHILE THE GENERAL POSITION IS UNDENIABLY
UNPLEASANT AND IF MISS PRESBURY CAN PROLONG HER VISIT
THAT IS EASY
THEN LET HER STAY TILL WE CAN ASSURE HER THAT ALL DANGER IS PAST
MEANWHILE LET HIM HAVE HIS WAY AND DO NOT CROSS HIM SO LONG AS HE
IS IN A GOOD HUMOUR ALL IS WELL
THERE HE IS SAID BENNETT IN A STARTLED WHISPER LOOKING BETWEEN
THE BRANCHES WE SAW THE TALL ERECT FIGURE EMERGE FROM THE HALL DOOR
AND LOOK AROUND HIM HE STOOD LEANING FORWARD HIS HANDS SWINGING
STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM HIS HEAD TURNING FROM SIDE TO SIDE THE
SECRETARY WITH A LAST WAVE SLIPPED OFF AMONG THE TREES AND WE SAW
HIM PRESENTLY REJOIN HIS EMPLOYER THE TWO ENTERING THE HOUSE
TOGETHER IN WHAT SEEMED TO BE ANIMATED AND EVEN EXCITED CONVERSATION
I EXPECT THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAS BEEN PUTTING TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
SAID HOLMES AS WE WALKED HOTELWARD HE STRUCK ME AS HAVING A
PARTICULARLY CLEAR AND LOGICAL BRAIN FROM THE LITTLE I SAW OF HIM
EXPLOSIVE NO DOUBT BUT THEN FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW HE HAS SOMETHING
TO EXPLODE ABOUT IF DETECTIVES ARE PUT ON HIS TRACK AND HE SUSPECTS
HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD OF DOING IT I RATHER FANCY THAT FRIEND BENNETT IS
IN FOR AN UNCOMFORTABLE TIME
HOLMES STOPPED AT A POSTOFFICE AND SENT OFF A TELEGRAM ON OUR WAY
THE ANSWER REACHED US IN THE EVENING AND HE TOSSED IT ACROSS TO ME
HAVE VISITED THE COMMERCIAL ROAD AND SEEN DORAK SUAVE PERSON
BOHEMIAN ELDERLY KEEPS LARGE GENERAL STORE
MERCER
MERCER IS SINCE YOUR TIME SAID HOLMES HE IS MY GENERAL UTILITY
MAN WHO LOOKS UP ROUTINE BUSINESS IT WAS IMPORTANT TO KNOW SOMETHING
OF THE MAN WITH WHOM OUR PROFESSOR WAS SO SECRETLY CORRESPONDING HIS
NATIONALITY CONNECTS UP WITH THE PRAGUE VISIT
THANK GOODNESS THAT SOMETHING CONNECTS WITH SOMETHING SAID I AT
PRESENT WE SEEM TO BE FACED BY A LONG SERIES OF INEXPLICABLE
INCIDENTS WITH NO BEARING UPON EACH OTHER FOR EXAMPLE WHAT POSSIBLE
CONNECTION CAN THERE BE BETWEEN AN ANGRY WOLFHOUND AND A VISIT TO
BOHEMIA OR EITHER OF THEM WITH A MAN CRAWLING DOWN A PASSAGE AT
NIGHT AS TO YOUR DATES THAT IS THE BIGGEST MYSTIFICATION OF ALL
HOLMES SMILED AND RUBBED HIS HANDS WE WERE I MAY SAY SEATED IN THE
OLD SITTINGROOM OF THE ANCIENT HOTEL WITH A BOTTLE OF THE FAMOUS
VINTAGE OF WHICH HOLMES HAD SPOKEN ON THE TABLE BETWEEN US
WELL NOW LET US TAKE THE DATES FIRST SAID HE HIS FINGERTIPS
TOGETHER AND HIS MANNER AS IF HE WERE ADDRESSING A CLASS THIS
EXCELLENT YOUNG MANS DIARY SHOWS THAT THERE WAS TROUBLE UPON JULY
D AND FROM THEN ONWARD IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AT NINEDAY INTERVALS
WITH SO FAR AS I REMEMBER ONLY ONE EXCEPTION THUS THE LAST
OUTBREAK UPON FRIDAY WAS ON SEPTEMBER D WHICH ALSO FALLS INTO THE
SERIES AS DID AUGUST TH WHICH PRECEDED IT THE THING IS BEYOND
COINCIDENCE
I WAS FORCED TO AGREE
LET US THEN FORM THE PROVISIONAL THEORY THAT EVERY NINE DAYS THE
PROFESSOR TAKES SOME STRONG DRUG WHICH HAS A PASSING BUT HIGHLY
POISONOUS EFFECT HIS NATURALLY VIOLENT NATURE IS INTENSIFIED BY IT
HE LEARNED TO TAKE THIS DRUG WHILE HE WAS IN PRAGUE AND IS NOW
SUPPLIED WITH IT BY A BOHEMIAN INTERMEDIARY IN LONDON THIS ALL HANGS
TOGETHER WATSON
BUT THE DOG THE FACE AT THE WINDOW THE CREEPING MAN IN THE
PASSAGE
WELL WELL WE HAVE MADE A BEGINNING I SHOULD NOT EXPECT ANY FRESH
DEVELOPMENTS UNTIL NEXT TUESDAY IN THE MEANTIME WE CAN ONLY KEEP IN
TOUCH WITH FRIEND BENNETT AND ENJOY THE AMENITIES OF THIS CHARMING
TOWN
IN THE MORNING MR BENNETT SLIPPED ROUND TO BRING US THE LATEST
REPORT AS HOLMES HAD IMAGINED TIMES HAD NOT BEEN EASY WITH HIM
WITHOUT EXACTLY ACCUSING HIM OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR PRESENCE
THE PROFESSOR HAD BEEN VERY ROUGH AND RUDE IN HIS SPEECH AND
EVIDENTLY FELT SOME STRONG GRIEVANCE THIS MORNING HE WAS QUITE
HIMSELF AGAIN HOWEVER AND HAD DELIVERED HIS USUAL BRILLIANT LECTURE
TO A CROWDED CLASS APART FROM HIS QUEER FITS SAID BENNETT HE
HAS ACTUALLY MORE ENERGY AND VITALITY THAN I CAN EVER REMEMBER NOR
WAS HIS BRAIN EVER CLEARER BUT ITS NOT HEITS NEVER THE MAN WHOM
WE HAVE KNOWN
I DONT THINK YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR NOW FOR A WEEK AT LEAST
HOLMES ANSWERED I AM A BUSY MAN AND DR WATSON HAS HIS PATIENTS TO
ATTEND TO LET US AGREE THAT WE MEET HERE AT THIS HOUR NEXT TUESDAY
AND I SHALL BE SURPRISED IF BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU AGAIN WE ARE NOT ABLE
TO EXPLAIN EVEN IF WE CANNOT PERHAPS PUT AN END TO YOUR TROUBLES
MEANWHILE KEEP US POSTED IN WHAT OCCURS
I SAW NOTHING OF MY FRIEND FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS BUT ON THE
FOLLOWING MONDAY EVENING I HAD A SHORT NOTE ASKING ME TO MEET HIM
NEXT DAY AT THE TRAIN FROM WHAT HE TOLD ME AS WE TRAVELLED UP TO
CAMFORD ALL WAS WELL THE PEACE OF THE PROFESSORS HOUSE HAD BEEN
UNRUFFLED AND HIS OWN CONDUCT PERFECTLY NORMAL THIS ALSO WAS THE
REPORT WHICH WAS GIVEN US BY MR BENNETT HIMSELF WHEN HE CALLED UPON
US THAT EVENING AT OUR OLD QUARTERS IN THE CHEQUERS HE HEARD FROM
HIS LONDON CORRESPONDENT TODAY THERE WAS A LETTER AND THERE WAS A
SMALL PACKET EACH WITH THE CROSS UNDER THE STAMP WHICH WARNED ME NOT
TO TOUCH THEM THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING ELSE
THAT MAY PROVE QUITE ENOUGH SAID HOLMES GRIMLY NOW MR BENNETT
WE SHALL I THINK COME TO SOME CONCLUSION TONIGHT IF MY DEDUCTIONS
ARE CORRECT WE SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF BRINGING MATTERS TO A
HEAD IN ORDER TO DO SO IT IS NECESSARY TO HOLD THE PROFESSOR UNDER
OBSERVATION I WOULD SUGGEST THEREFORE THAT YOU REMAIN AWAKE AND ON
THE LOOKOUT SHOULD YOU HEAR HIM PASS YOUR DOOR DO NOT INTERRUPT
HIM BUT FOLLOW HIM AS DISCREETLY AS YOU CAN DR WATSON AND I WILL
NOT BE FAR OFF BY THE WAY WHERE IS THE KEY OF THAT LITTLE BOX OF
WHICH YOU SPOKE
UPON HIS WATCHCHAIN
I FANCY OUR RESEARCHES MUST LIE IN THAT DIRECTION AT THE WORST THE
LOCK SHOULD NOT BE VERY FORMIDABLE HAVE YOU ANY OTHER ABLEBODIED
MAN ON THE PREMISES
THERE IS THE COACHMAN MACPHAIL
WHERE DOES HE SLEEP
OVER THE STABLES
WE MIGHT POSSIBLY WANT HIM WELL WE CAN DO NO MORE UNTIL WE SEE HOW
THINGS DEVELOP GOODBYEBUT I EXPECT THAT WE SHALL SEE YOU BEFORE
MORNING
IT WAS NEARLY MIDNIGHT BEFORE WE TOOK OUR STATION AMONG SOME BUSHES
IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE THE HALL DOOR OF THE PROFESSOR IT WAS A FINE
NIGHT BUT CHILLY AND WE WERE GLAD OF OUR WARM OVERCOATS THERE WAS
A BREEZE AND CLOUDS WERE SCUDDING ACROSS THE SKY OBSCURING FROM
TIME TO TIME THE HALFMOON IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DISMAL VIGIL WERE IT
NOT FOR THE EXPECTATION AND EXCITEMENT WHICH CARRIED US ALONG AND
THE ASSURANCE OF MY COMRADE THAT WE HAD PROBABLY REACHED THE END OF
THE STRANGE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS WHICH HAD ENGAGED OUR ATTENTION
IF THE CYCLE OF NINE DAYS HOLDS GOOD THEN WE SHALL HAVE THE
PROFESSOR AT HIS WORST TONIGHT SAID HOLMES THE FACT THAT THESE
STRANGE SYMPTOMS BEGAN AFTER HIS VISIT TO PRAGUE THAT HE IS IN
SECRET CORRESPONDENCE WITH A BOHEMIAN DEALER IN LONDON WHO
PRESUMABLY REPRESENTS SOMEONE IN PRAGUE AND THAT HE RECEIVED A
PACKET FROM HIM THIS VERY DAY ALL POINT IN ONE DIRECTION WHAT HE
TAKES AND WHY HE TAKES IT ARE STILL BEYOND OUR KEN BUT THAT IT
EMANATES IN SOME WAY FROM PRAGUE IS CLEAR ENOUGH HE TAKES IT UNDER
DEFINITE DIRECTIONS WHICH REGULATE THIS NINTHDAY SYSTEM WHICH WAS
THE FIRST POINT WHICH ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION BUT HIS SYMPTOMS ARE
MOST REMARKABLE DID YOU OBSERVE HIS KNUCKLES
I HAD TO CONFESS THAT I DID NOT
THICK AND HORNY IN A WAY WHICH IS QUITE NEW IN MY EXPERIENCE ALWAYS
LOOK AT THE HANDS FIRST WATSON THEN CUFFS TROUSERKNEES AND
BOOTS VERY CURIOUS KNUCKLES WHICH CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY THE MODE
OF PROGRESSION OBSERVED BY HOLMES PAUSED AND SUDDENLY CLAPPED HIS
HAND TO HIS FOREHEAD OH WATSON WATSON WHAT A FOOL I HAVE BEEN
IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE AND YET IT MUST BE TRUE ALL POINTS IN ONE
DIRECTION HOW COULD I MISS SEEING THE CONNECTION OF IDEAS THOSE
KNUCKLESHOW COULD I HAVE PASSED THOSE KNUCKLES AND THE DOG AND
THE IVY ITS SURELY TIME THAT I DISAPPEARED INTO THAT LITTLE FARM OF
MY DREAMS LOOK OUT WATSON HERE HE IS WE SHALL HAVE THE CHANCE OF
SEEING FOR OURSELVES
THE HALL DOOR HAD SLOWLY OPENED AND AGAINST THE LAMPLIT BACKGROUND
WE SAW THE TALL FIGURE OF PROFESSOR PRESBURY HE WAS CLAD IN HIS
DRESSINGGOWN AS HE STOOD OUTLINED IN THE DOORWAY HE WAS ERECT BUT
LEANING FORWARD WITH DANGLING ARMS AS WHEN WE SAW HIM LAST
NOW HE STEPPED FORWARD INTO THE DRIVE AND AN EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE
CAME OVER HIM HE SANK DOWN INTO A CROUCHING POSITION AND MOVED ALONG
UPON HIS HANDS AND FEET SKIPPING EVERY NOW AND THEN AS IF HE WERE
OVERFLOWING WITH ENERGY AND VITALITY HE MOVED ALONG THE FACE OF THE
HOUSE AND THEN ROUND THE CORNER AS HE DISAPPEARED BENNETT SLIPPED
THROUGH THE HALL DOOR AND SOFTLY FOLLOWED HIM
COME WATSON COME CRIED HOLMES AND WE STOLE AS SOFTLY AS WE
COULD THROUGH THE BUSHES UNTIL WE HAD GAINED A SPOT WHENCE WE COULD
SEE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE WHICH WAS BATHED IN THE LIGHT OF THE
HALFMOON THE PROFESSOR WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE CROUCHING AT THE FOOT OF
THE IVYCOVERED WALL AS WE WATCHED HIM HE SUDDENLY BEGAN WITH
INCREDIBLE AGILITY TO ASCEND IT FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH HE SPRANG
SURE OF FOOT AND FIRM OF GRASP CLIMBING APPARENTLY IN MERE JOY AT
HIS OWN POWERS WITH NO DEFINITE OBJECT IN VIEW WITH HIS
DRESSINGGOWN FLAPPING ON EACH SIDE OF HIM HE LOOKED LIKE SOME HUGE
BAT GLUED AGAINST THE SIDE OF HIS OWN HOUSE A GREAT SQUARE DARK
PATCH UPON THE MOONLIT WALL PRESENTLY HE TIRED OF THIS AMUSEMENT
AND DROPPING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH HE SQUATTED DOWN INTO THE OLD
ATTITUDE AND MOVED TOWARDS THE STABLES CREEPING ALONG IN THE SAME
STRANGE WAY AS BEFORE THE WOLFHOUND WAS OUT NOW BARKING FURIOUSLY
AND MORE EXCITED THAN EVER WHEN IT ACTUALLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF ITS
MASTER IT WAS STRAINING ON ITS CHAIN AND QUIVERING WITH EAGERNESS
AND RAGE THE PROFESSOR SQUATTED DOWN VERY DELIBERATELY JUST OUT OF
REACH OF THE HOUND AND BEGAN TO PROVOKE IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY HE
TOOK HANDFULS OF PEBBLES FROM THE DRIVE AND THREW THEM IN THE DOGS
FACE PRODDED HIM WITH A STICK WHICH HE HAD PICKED UP FLICKED HIS
HANDS ABOUT ONLY A FEW INCHES FROM THE GAPING MOUTH AND ENDEAVOURED
IN EVERY WAY TO INCREASE THE ANIMALS FURY WHICH WAS ALREADY BEYOND
ALL CONTROL IN ALL OUR ADVENTURES I DO NOT KNOW THAT I HAVE EVER
SEEN A MORE STRANGE SIGHT THAN THIS IMPASSIVE AND STILL DIGNIFIED
FIGURE CROUCHING FROGLIKE UPON THE GROUND AND GOADING TO A WILDER
EXHIBITION OF PASSION THE MADDENED HOUND WHICH RAMPED AND RAGED IN
FRONT OF HIM BY ALL MANNER OF INGENIOUS AND CALCULATED CRUELTY
AND THEN IN A MOMENT IT HAPPENED IT WAS NOT THE CHAIN THAT BROKE
BUT IT WAS THE COLLAR THAT SLIPPED FOR IT HAD BEEN MADE FOR A
THICKNECKED NEWFOUNDLAND WE HEARD THE RATTLE OF FALLING METAL AND
THE NEXT INSTANT DOG AND MAN WERE ROLLING ON THE GROUND TOGETHER THE
ONE ROARING IN RAGE THE OTHER SCREAMING IN A STRANGE SHRILL FALSETTO
OF TERROR IT WAS A VERY NARROW THING FOR THE PROFESSORS LIFE THE
SAVAGE CREATURE HAD HIM FAIRLY BY THE THROAT ITS FANGS HAD BITTEN
DEEP AND HE WAS SENSELESS BEFORE WE COULD REACH THEM AND DRAG THE
TWO APART IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A DANGEROUS TASK FOR US BUT BENNETTS
VOICE AND PRESENCE BROUGHT THE GREAT WOLFHOUND INSTANTLY TO REASON
THE UPROAR HAD BROUGHT THE SLEEPY AND ASTONISHED COACHMAN FROM HIS
ROOM ABOVE THE STABLES IM NOT SURPRISED SAID HE SHAKING HIS
HEAD IVE SEEN HIM AT IT BEFORE I KNEW THE DOG WOULD GET HIM
SOONER OR LATER
THE HOUND WAS SECURED AND TOGETHER WE CARRIED THE PROFESSOR UP TO
HIS ROOM WHERE BENNETT WHO HAD A MEDICAL DEGREE HELPED ME TO DRESS
HIS TORN THROAT THE SHARP TEETH HAD PASSED DANGEROUSLY NEAR THE
CAROTID ARTERY AND THE HAEMORRHAGE WAS SERIOUS IN HALF AN HOUR THE
DANGER WAS PAST I HAD GIVEN THE PATIENT AN INJECTION OF MORPHIA AND
HE HAD SUNK INTO DEEP SLEEP THEN AND ONLY THEN WERE WE ABLE TO
LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND TO TAKE STOCK OF THE SITUATION
I THINK A FIRSTCLASS SURGEON SHOULD SEE HIM SAID I
FOR GODS SAKE NO CRIED BENNETT AT PRESENT THE SCANDAL IS
CONFINED TO OUR OWN HOUSEHOLD IT IS SAFE WITH US IF IT GETS BEYOND
THESE WALLS IT WILL NEVER STOP CONSIDER HIS POSITION AT THE
UNIVERSITY HIS EUROPEAN REPUTATION THE FEELINGS OF HIS DAUGHTER
QUITE SO SAID HOLMES I THINK IT MAY BE QUITE POSSIBLE TO KEEP
THE MATTER TO OURSELVES AND ALSO TO PREVENT ITS RECURRENCE NOW THAT
WE HAVE A FREE HAND THE KEY FROM THE WATCHCHAIN MR BENNETT
MACPHAIL WILL GUARD THE PATIENT AND LET US KNOW IF THERE IS ANY
CHANGE LET US SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND IN THE PROFESSORS MYSTERIOUS
BOX
THERE WAS NOT MUCH BUT THERE WAS ENOUGHAN EMPTY PHIAL ANOTHER
NEARLY FULL A HYPODERMIC SYRINGE SEVERAL LETTERS IN A CRABBED
FOREIGN HAND THE MARKS ON THE ENVELOPES SHOWED THAT THEY WERE THOSE
WHICH HAD DISTURBED THE ROUTINE OF THE SECRETARY AND EACH WAS DATED
FROM THE COMMERCIAL ROAD AND SIGNED A DORAK THEY WERE MERE
INVOICES TO SAY THAT A FRESH BOTTLE WAS BEING SENT TO PROFESSOR
PRESBURY OR RECEIPT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MONEY THERE WAS ONE OTHER
ENVELOPE HOWEVER IN A MORE EDUCATED HAND AND BEARING THE AUSTRIAN
STAMP WITH THE POSTMARK OF PRAGUE HERE WE HAVE OUR MATERIAL CRIED
HOLMES AS HE TORE OUT THE ENCLOSURE
HONOURED COLLEAGUE IT RAN
SINCE YOUR ESTEEMED VISIT I HAVE THOUGHT MUCH OF YOUR CASE AND
THOUGH IN YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES THERE ARE SOME SPECIAL REASONS FOR THE
TREATMENT I WOULD NONE THE LESS ENJOIN CAUTION AS MY RESULTS HAVE
SHOWN THAT IT IS NOT WITHOUT DANGER OF A KIND
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE SERUM OF ANTHROPOID WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER I
HAVE AS I EXPLAINED TO YOU USED BLACKFACED LANGUR BECAUSE A
SPECIMEN WAS ACCESSIBLE LANGUR IS OF COURSE A CRAWLER AND CLIMBER
WHILE ANTHROPOID WALKS ERECT AND IS IN ALL WAYS NEARER
I BEG YOU TO TAKE EVERY POSSIBLE PRECAUTION THAT THERE BE NO
PREMATURE REVELATION OF THE PROCESS I HAVE ONE OTHER CLIENT IN
ENGLAND AND DORAK IS MY AGENT FOR BOTH
WEEKLY REPORTS WILL OBLIGE
YOURS WITH HIGH ESTEEM
H LOWENSTEIN
LOWENSTEIN THE NAME BROUGHT BACK TO ME THE MEMORY OF SOME SNIPPET
FROM A NEWSPAPER WHICH SPOKE OF AN OBSCURE SCIENTIST WHO WAS STRIVING
IN SOME UNKNOWN WAY FOR THE SECRET OF REJUVENESCENCE AND THE ELIXIR
OF LIFE LOWENSTEIN OF PRAGUE LOWENSTEIN WITH THE WONDROUS
STRENGTHGIVING SERUM TABOOED BY THE PROFESSION BECAUSE HE REFUSED
TO REVEAL ITS SOURCE IN A FEW WORDS I SAID WHAT I REMEMBERED
BENNETT HAD TAKEN A MANUAL OF ZOOLOGY FROM THE SHELVES LANGUR
HE READ THE GREAT BLACKFACED MONKEY OF THE HIMALAYAN SLOPES
BIGGEST AND MOST HUMAN OF CLIMBING MONKEYS MANY DETAILS ARE ADDED
WELL THANKS TO YOU MR HOLMES IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE TRACED
THE EVIL TO ITS SOURCE
THE REAL SOURCE SAID HOLMES LIES OF COURSE IN THAT UNTIMELY
LOVE AFFAIR WHICH GAVE OUR IMPETUOUS PROFESSOR THE IDEA THAT HE COULD
ONLY GAIN HIS WISH BY TURNING HIMSELF INTO A YOUNGER MAN WHEN ONE
TRIES TO RISE ABOVE NATURE ONE IS LIABLE TO FALL BELOW IT THE
HIGHEST TYPE OF MAN MAY REVERT TO THE ANIMAL IF HE LEAVES THE
STRAIGHT ROAD OF DESTINY HE SAT MUSING FOR A LITTLE WITH THE PHIAL
IN HIS HAND LOOKING AT THE CLEAR LIQUID WITHIN WHEN I HAVE WRITTEN
TO THIS MAN AND TOLD HIM THAT I HOLD HIM CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE POISONS WHICH HE CIRCULATES WE WILL HAVE NO MORE TROUBLE BUT IT
MAY RECUR OTHERS MAY FIND A BETTER WAY THERE IS DANGER THEREA
VERY REAL DANGER TO HUMANITY CONSIDER WATSON THAT THE MATERIAL
THE SENSUAL THE WORLDLY WOULD ALL PROLONG THEIR WORTHLESS LIVES THE
SPIRITUAL WOULD NOT AVOID THE CALL TO SOMETHING HIGHER IT WOULD BE
THE SURVIVAL OF THE LEAST FIT WHAT SORT OF CESSPOOL MAY NOT OUR POOR
WORLD BECOME SUDDENLY THE DREAMER DISAPPEARED AND HOLMES THE MAN
OF ACTION SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR I THINK THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO
BE SAID MR BENNETT THE VARIOUS INCIDENTS WILL NOW FIT THEMSELVES
EASILY INTO THE GENERAL SCHEME THE DOG OF COURSE WAS AWARE OF THE
CHANGE FAR MORE QUICKLY THAN YOU HIS SMELL WOULD INSURE THAT IT WAS
THE MONKEY NOT THE PROFESSOR WHOM ROY ATTACKED JUST AS IT WAS THE
MONKEY WHO TEASED ROY CLIMBING WAS A JOY TO THE CREATURE AND IT WAS
A MERE CHANCE I TAKE IT THAT THE PASTIME BROUGHT HIM TO THE YOUNG
LADYS WINDOW THERE IS AN EARLY TRAIN TO TOWN WATSON BUT I THINK
WE SHALL JUST HAVE TIME FOR A CUP OF TEA AT THE CHEQUERS BEFORE WE
CATCH IT
THE ADVENTURE OF THE LIONS MANE
IT IS A MOST SINGULAR THING THAT A PROBLEM WHICH WAS CERTAINLY AS
ABSTRUSE AND UNUSUAL AS ANY WHICH I HAVE FACED IN MY LONG
PROFESSIONAL CAREER SHOULD HAVE COME TO ME AFTER MY RETIREMENT AND
BE BROUGHT AS IT WERE TO MY VERY DOOR IT OCCURRED AFTER MY
WITHDRAWAL TO MY LITTLE SUSSEX HOME WHEN I HAD GIVEN MYSELF UP
ENTIRELY TO THAT SOOTHING LIFE OF NATURE FOR WHICH I HAD SO OFTEN
YEARNED DURING THE LONG YEARS SPENT AMID THE GLOOM OF LONDON AT THIS
PERIOD OF MY LIFE THE GOOD WATSON HAD PASSED ALMOST BEYOND MY KEN AN
OCCASIONAL WEEKEND VISIT WAS THE MOST THAT I EVER SAW OF HIM THUS I
MUST ACT AS MY OWN CHRONICLER AH HAD HE BUT BEEN WITH ME HOW MUCH
HE MIGHT HAVE MADE OF SO WONDERFUL A HAPPENING AND OF MY EVENTUAL
TRIUMPH AGAINST EVERY DIFFICULTY AS IT IS HOWEVER I MUST NEEDS
TELL MY TALE IN MY OWN PLAIN WAY SHOWING BY MY WORDS EACH STEP UPON
THE DIFFICULT ROAD WHICH LAY BEFORE ME AS I SEARCHED FOR THE MYSTERY
OF THE LIONS MANE
MY VILLA IS SITUATED UPON THE SOUTHERN SLOPE OF THE DOWNS COMMANDING
A GREAT VIEW OF THE CHANNEL AT THIS POINT THE COASTLINE IS ENTIRELY
OF CHALK CLIFFS WHICH CAN ONLY BE DESCENDED BY A SINGLE LONG
TORTUOUS PATH WHICH IS STEEP AND SLIPPERY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PATH
LIE A HUNDRED YARDS OF PEBBLES AND SHINGLE EVEN WHEN THE TIDE IS AT
FULL HERE AND THERE HOWEVER THERE ARE CURVES AND HOLLOWS WHICH
MAKE SPLENDID SWIMMINGPOOLS FILLED AFRESH WITH EACH FLOW THIS
ADMIRABLE BEACH EXTENDS FOR SOME MILES IN EACH DIRECTION SAVE ONLY
AT ONE POINT WHERE THE LITTLE COVE AND VILLAGE OF FULWORTH BREAK THE
LINE
MY HOUSE IS LONELY I MY OLD HOUSEKEEPER AND MY BEES HAVE THE
ESTATE ALL TO OURSELVES HALF A MILE OFF HOWEVER IS HAROLD
STACKHURSTS WELLKNOWN COACHING ESTABLISHMENT THE GABLES QUITE A
LARGE PLACE WHICH CONTAINS SOME SCORE OF YOUNG FELLOWS PREPARING FOR
VARIOUS PROFESSIONS WITH A STAFF OF SEVERAL MASTERS STACKHURST
HIMSELF WAS A WELLKNOWN ROWING BLUE IN HIS DAY AND AN EXCELLENT
ALLROUND SCHOLAR HE AND I WERE ALWAYS FRIENDLY FROM THE DAY I CAME
TO THE COAST AND HE WAS THE ONE MAN WHO WAS ON SUCH TERMS WITH ME
THAT WE COULD DROP IN ON EACH OTHER IN THE EVENINGS WITHOUT AN
INVITATION
TOWARDS THE END OF JULY THERE WAS A SEVERE GALE THE WIND
BLOWING UPCHANNEL HEAPING THE SEAS TO THE BASE OF THE CLIFFS AND
LEAVING A LAGOON AT THE TURN OF THE TIDE ON THE MORNING OF WHICH I
SPEAK THE WIND HAD ABATED AND ALL NATURE WAS NEWLY WASHED AND FRESH
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK UPON SO DELIGHTFUL A DAY AND I STROLLED
OUT BEFORE BREAKFAST TO ENJOY THE EXQUISITE AIR I WALKED ALONG THE
CLIFF PATH WHICH LED TO THE STEEP DESCENT TO THE BEACH AS I WALKED I
HEARD A SHOUT BEHIND ME AND THERE WAS HAROLD STACKHURST WAVING HIS
HAND IN CHEERY GREETING
WHAT A MORNING MR HOLMES I THOUGHT I SHOULD SEE YOU OUT
GOING FOR A SWIM I SEE
AT YOUR OLD TRICKS AGAIN HE LAUGHED PATTING HIS BULGING POCKET
YES MCPHERSON STARTED EARLY AND I EXPECT I MAY FIND HIM THERE
FITZROY MCPHERSON WAS THE SCIENCE MASTER A FINE UPSTANDING YOUNG
FELLOW WHOSE LIFE HAD BEEN CRIPPLED BY HEART TROUBLE FOLLOWING
RHEUMATIC FEVER HE WAS A NATURAL ATHLETE HOWEVER AND EXCELLED IN
EVERY GAME WHICH DID NOT THROW TOO GREAT A STRAIN UPON HIM SUMMER
AND WINTER HE WENT FOR HIS SWIM AND AS I AM A SWIMMER MYSELF I
HAVE OFTEN JOINED HIM
AT THIS MOMENT WE SAW THE MAN HIMSELF HIS HEAD SHOWED ABOVE THE EDGE
OF THE CLIFF WHERE THE PATH ENDS THEN HIS WHOLE FIGURE APPEARED AT
THE TOP STAGGERING LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN THE NEXT INSTANT HE THREW UP
HIS HANDS AND WITH A TERRIBLE CRY FELL UPON HIS FACE STACKHURST
AND I RUSHED FORWARDIT MAY HAVE BEEN FIFTY YARDSAND TURNED HIM ON
HIS BACK HE WAS OBVIOUSLY DYING THOSE GLAZED SUNKEN EYES AND
DREADFUL LIVID CHEEKS COULD MEAN NOTHING ELSE ONE GLIMMER OF LIFE
CAME INTO HIS FACE FOR AN INSTANT AND HE UTTERED TWO OR THREE WORDS
WITH AN EAGER AIR OF WARNING THEY WERE SLURRED AND INDISTINCT BUT
TO MY EAR THE LAST OF THEM WHICH BURST IN A SHRIEK FROM HIS LIPS
WERE THE LIONS MANE IT WAS UTTERLY IRRELEVANT AND UNINTELLIGIBLE
AND YET I COULD TWIST THE SOUND INTO NO OTHER SENSE THEN HE HALF
RAISED HIMSELF FROM THE GROUND THREW HIS ARMS INTO THE AIR AND FELL
FORWARD ON HIS SIDE HE WAS DEAD
MY COMPANION WAS PARALYZED BY THE SUDDEN HORROR OF IT BUT I AS MAY
WELL BE IMAGINED HAD EVERY SENSE ON THE ALERT AND I HAD NEED FOR
IT WAS SPEEDILY EVIDENT THAT WE WERE IN THE PRESENCE OF AN
EXTRAORDINARY CASE THE MAN WAS DRESSED ONLY IN HIS BURBERRY
OVERCOAT HIS TROUSERS AND AN UNLACED PAIR OF CANVAS SHOES AS HE
FELL OVER HIS BURBERRY WHICH HAD BEEN SIMPLY THROWN ROUND HIS
SHOULDERS SLIPPED OFF EXPOSING HIS TRUNK WE STARED AT IT IN
AMAZEMENT HIS BACK WAS COVERED WITH DARK RED LINES AS THOUGH HE HAD
BEEN TERRIBLY FLOGGED BY A THIN WIRE SCOURGE THE INSTRUMENT WITH
WHICH THIS PUNISHMENT HAD BEEN INFLICTED WAS CLEARLY FLEXIBLE FOR
THE LONG ANGRY WEALS CURVED ROUND HIS SHOULDERS AND RIBS THERE WAS
BLOOD DRIPPING DOWN HIS CHIN FOR HE HAD BITTEN THROUGH HIS LOWER LIP
IN THE PAROXYSM OF HIS AGONY HIS DRAWN AND DISTORTED FACE TOLD HOW
TERRIBLE THAT AGONY HAD BEEN
I WAS KNEELING AND STACKHURST STANDING BY THE BODY WHEN A SHADOW FELL
ACROSS US AND WE FOUND THAT IAN MURDOCH WAS BY OUR SIDE MURDOCH WAS
THE MATHEMATICAL COACH AT THE ESTABLISHMENT A TALL DARK THIN MAN
SO TACITURN AND ALOOF THAT NONE CAN BE SAID TO HAVE BEEN HIS FRIEND
HE SEEMED TO LIVE IN SOME HIGH ABSTRACT REGION OF SURDS AND CONIC
SECTIONS WITH LITTLE TO CONNECT HIM WITH ORDINARY LIFE HE WAS
LOOKED UPON AS AN ODDITY BY THE STUDENTS AND WOULD HAVE BEEN THEIR
BUTT BUT THERE WAS SOME STRANGE OUTLANDISH BLOOD IN THE MAN WHICH
SHOWED ITSELF NOT ONLY IN HIS COALBLACK EYES AND SWARTHY FACE BUT
ALSO IN OCCASIONAL OUTBREAKS OF TEMPER WHICH COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED
AS FEROCIOUS ON ONE OCCASION BEING PLAGUED BY A LITTLE DOG
BELONGING TO MCPHERSON HE HAD CAUGHT THE CREATURE UP AND HURLED IT
THROUGH THE PLATEGLASS WINDOW AN ACTION FOR WHICH STACKHURST WOULD
CERTAINLY HAVE GIVEN HIM HIS DISMISSAL HAD HE NOT BEEN A VERY
VALUABLE TEACHER SUCH WAS THE STRANGE COMPLEX MAN WHO NOW APPEARED
BESIDE US HE SEEMED TO BE HONESTLY SHOCKED AT THE SIGHT BEFORE HIM
THOUGH THE INCIDENT OF THE DOG MAY SHOW THAT THERE WAS NO GREAT
SYMPATHY BETWEEN THE DEAD MAN AND HIMSELF
POOR FELLOW POOR FELLOW WHAT CAN I DO HOW CAN I HELP
WERE YOU WITH HIM CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HAS HAPPENED
NO NO I WAS LATE THIS MORNING I WAS NOT ON THE BEACH AT ALL I
HAVE COME STRAIGHT FROM THE GABLES WHAT CAN I DO
YOU CAN HURRY TO THE POLICESTATION AT FULWORTH REPORT THE MATTER
AT ONCE
WITHOUT A WORD HE MADE OFF AT TOP SPEED AND I PROCEEDED TO TAKE THE
MATTER IN HAND WHILE STACKHURST DAZED AT THIS TRAGEDY REMAINED BY
THE BODY MY FIRST TASK NATURALLY WAS TO NOTE WHO WAS ON THE BEACH
FROM THE TOP OF THE PATH I COULD SEE THE WHOLE SWEEP OF IT AND IT
WAS ABSOLUTELY DESERTED SAVE THAT TWO OR THREE DARK FIGURES COULD BE
SEEN FAR AWAY MOVING TOWARDS THE VILLAGE OF FULWORTH HAVING
SATISFIED MYSELF UPON THIS POINT I WALKED SLOWLY DOWN THE PATH
THERE WAS CLAY OR SOFT MARL MIXED WITH THE CHALK AND EVERY HERE AND
THERE I SAW THE SAME FOOTSTEP BOTH ASCENDING AND DESCENDING NO ONE
ELSE HAD GONE DOWN TO THE BEACH BY THIS TRACK THAT MORNING AT ONE
PLACE I OBSERVED THE PRINT OF AN OPEN HAND WITH THE FINGERS TOWARDS
THE INCLINE THIS COULD ONLY MEAN THAT POOR MCPHERSON HAD FALLEN AS
HE ASCENDED THERE WERE ROUNDED DEPRESSIONS TOO WHICH SUGGESTED
THAT HE HAD COME DOWN UPON HIS KNEES MORE THAN ONCE AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE PATH WAS THE CONSIDERABLE LAGOON LEFT BY THE RETREATING TIDE AT
THE SIDE OF IT MCPHERSON HAD UNDRESSED FOR THERE LAY HIS TOWEL ON A
ROCK IT WAS FOLDED AND DRY SO THAT IT WOULD SEEM THAT AFTER ALL
HE HAD NEVER ENTERED THE WATER ONCE OR TWICE AS I HUNTED ROUND AMID
THE HARD SHINGLE I CAME ON LITTLE PATCHES OF SAND WHERE THE PRINT OF
HIS CANVAS SHOE AND ALSO OF HIS NAKED FOOT COULD BE SEEN THE
LATTER FACT PROVED THAT HE HAD MADE ALL READY TO BATHE THOUGH THE
TOWEL INDICATED THAT HE HAD NOT ACTUALLY DONE SO
AND HERE WAS THE PROBLEM CLEARLY DEFINEDAS STRANGE A ONE AS HAD
EVER CONFRONTED ME THE MAN HAD NOT BEEN ON THE BEACH MORE THAN A
QUARTER OF AN HOUR AT THE MOST STACKHURST HAD FOLLOWED HIM FROM THE
GABLES SO THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT HE HAD GONE TO BATHE
AND HAD STRIPPED AS THE NAKED FOOTSTEPS SHOWED THEN HE HAD SUDDENLY
HUDDLED ON HIS CLOTHES AGAINTHEY WERE ALL DISHEVELLED AND
UNFASTENEDAND HE HAD RETURNED WITHOUT BATHING OR AT ANY RATE
WITHOUT DRYING HIMSELF AND THE REASON FOR HIS CHANGE OF PURPOSE HAD
BEEN THAT HE HAD BEEN SCOURGED IN SOME SAVAGE INHUMAN FASHION
TORTURED UNTIL HE BIT HIS LIP THROUGH IN HIS AGONY AND WAS LEFT WITH
ONLY STRENGTH ENOUGH TO CRAWL AWAY AND TO DIE WHO HAD DONE THIS
BARBAROUS DEED THERE WERE IT IS TRUE SMALL GROTTOS AND CAVES IN
THE BASE OF THE CLIFFS BUT THE LOW SUN SHONE DIRECTLY INTO THEM AND
THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR CONCEALMENT THEN AGAIN THERE WERE THOSE
DISTANT FIGURES ON THE BEACH THEY SEEMED TOO FAR AWAY TO HAVE BEEN
CONNECTED WITH THE CRIME AND THE BROAD LAGOON IN WHICH MCPHERSON HAD
INTENDED TO BATHE LAY BETWEEN HIM AND THEM LAPPING UP TO THE ROCKS
ON THE SEA TWO OR THREE FISHINGBOATS WERE AT NO GREAT DISTANCE
THEIR OCCUPANTS MIGHT BE EXAMINED AT OUR LEISURE THERE WERE SEVERAL
ROADS FOR INQUIRY BUT NONE WHICH LED TO ANY VERY OBVIOUS GOAL
WHEN I AT LAST RETURNED TO THE BODY I FOUND THAT A LITTLE GROUP OF
WONDERING FOLK HAD GATHERED ROUND IT STACKHURST WAS OF COURSE
STILL THERE AND IAN MURDOCH HAD JUST ARRIVED WITH ANDERSON THE
VILLAGE CONSTABLE A BIG GINGERMOUSTACHED MAN OF THE SLOW SOLID
SUSSEX BREEDA BREED WHICH COVERS MUCH GOOD SENSE UNDER A HEAVY
SILENT EXTERIOR HE LISTENED TO EVERYTHING TOOK NOTE OF ALL WE SAID
AND FINALLY DREW ME ASIDE
ID BE GLAD OF YOUR ADVICE MR HOLMES THIS IS A BIG THING FOR ME
TO HANDLE AND ILL HEAR OF IT FROM LEWES IF I GO WRONG
I ADVISED HIM TO SEND FOR HIS IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR AND FOR A DOCTOR
ALSO TO ALLOW NOTHING TO BE MOVED AND AS FEW FRESH FOOTMARKS AS
POSSIBLE TO BE MADE UNTIL THEY CAME IN THE MEANTIME I SEARCHED THE
DEAD MANS POCKETS THERE WERE HIS HANDKERCHIEF A LARGE KNIFE AND A
SMALL FOLDING CARDCASE FROM THIS PROJECTED A SLIP OF PAPER WHICH I
UNFOLDED AND HANDED TO THE CONSTABLE THERE WAS WRITTEN ON IT IN A
SCRAWLING FEMININE HAND
I WILL BE THERE YOU MAY BE SURE
MAUDIE
IT READ LIKE A LOVE AFFAIR AN ASSIGNATION THOUGH WHEN AND WHERE
WERE A BLANK THE CONSTABLE REPLACED IT IN THE CARDCASE AND RETURNED
IT WITH THE OTHER THINGS TO THE POCKETS OF THE BURBERRY THEN AS
NOTHING MORE SUGGESTED ITSELF I WALKED BACK TO MY HOUSE FOR
BREAKFAST HAVING FIRST ARRANGED THAT THE BASE OF THE CLIFFS SHOULD
BE THOROUGHLY SEARCHED
STACKHURST WAS ROUND IN AN HOUR OR TWO TO TELL ME THAT THE BODY HAD
BEEN REMOVED TO THE GABLES WHERE THE INQUEST WOULD BE HELD HE
BROUGHT WITH HIM SOME SERIOUS AND DEFINITE NEWS AS I EXPECTED
NOTHING HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE SMALL CAVES BELOW THE CLIFF BUT HE HAD
EXAMINED THE PAPERS IN MCPHERSONS DESK AND THERE WERE SEVERAL WHICH
SHOWED AN INTIMATE CORRESPONDENCE WITH A CERTAIN MISS MAUD BELLAMY
OF FULWORTH WE HAD THEN ESTABLISHED THE IDENTITY OF THE WRITER OF
THE NOTE
THE POLICE HAVE THE LETTERS HE EXPLAINED I COULD NOT BRING THEM
BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS A SERIOUS LOVE AFFAIR I SEE NO
REASON HOWEVER TO CONNECT IT WITH THAT HORRIBLE HAPPENING SAVE
INDEED THAT THE LADY HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM
BUT HARDLY AT A BATHINGPOOL WHICH ALL OF YOU WERE IN THE HABIT OF
USING I REMARKED
IT IS MERE CHANCE SAID HE THAT SEVERAL OF THE STUDENTS WERE NOT
WITH MCPHERSON
WAS IT MERE CHANCE
STACKHURST KNIT HIS BROWS IN THOUGHT
IAN MURDOCH HELD THEM BACK SAID HE HE WOULD INSIST UPON SOME
ALGEBRAIC DEMONSTRATION BEFORE BREAKFAST POOR CHAP HE IS DREADFULLY
CUT UP ABOUT IT ALL
AND YET I GATHER THAT THEY WERE NOT FRIENDS
AT ONE TIME THEY WERE NOT BUT FOR A YEAR OR MORE MURDOCH HAS BEEN
AS NEAR TO MCPHERSON AS HE EVER COULD BE TO ANYONE HE IS NOT OF A
VERY SYMPATHETIC DISPOSITION BY NATURE
SO I UNDERSTAND I SEEM TO REMEMBER YOUR TELLING ME ONCE ABOUT A
QUARREL OVER THE ILLUSAGE OF A DOG
THAT BLEW OVER ALL RIGHT
BUT LEFT SOME VINDICTIVE FEELING PERHAPS
NO NO I AM SURE THEY WERE REAL FRIENDS
WELL THEN WE MUST EXPLORE THE MATTER OF THE GIRL DO YOU KNOW
HER
EVERYONE KNOWS HER SHE IS THE BEAUTY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOODA REAL
BEAUTY HOLMES WHO WOULD DRAW ATTENTION EVERYWHERE I KNEW THAT
MCPHERSON WAS ATTRACTED BY HER BUT I HAD NO NOTION THAT IT HAD GONE
SO FAR AS THESE LETTERS WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE
BUT WHO IS SHE
SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF OLD TOM BELLAMY WHO OWNS ALL THE BOATS AND
BATHINGCOTS AT FULWORTH HE WAS A FISHERMAN TO START WITH BUT IS
NOW A MAN OF SOME SUBSTANCE HE AND HIS SON WILLIAM RUN THE
BUSINESS
SHALL WE WALK INTO FULWORTH AND SEE THEM
ON WHAT PRETEXT
OH WE CAN EASILY FIND A PRETEXT AFTER ALL THIS POOR MAN DID NOT
ILLUSE HIMSELF IN THIS OUTRAGEOUS WAY SOME HUMAN HAND WAS ON THE
HANDLE OF THAT SCOURGE IF INDEED IT WAS A SCOURGE WHICH INFLICTED
THE INJURIES HIS CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCES IN THIS LONELY PLACE WAS
SURELY LIMITED LET US FOLLOW IT UP IN EVERY DIRECTION AND WE CAN
HARDLY FAIL TO COME UPON THE MOTIVE WHICH IN TURN SHOULD LEAD US TO
THE CRIMINAL
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PLEASANT WALK ACROSS THE THYMESCENTED DOWNS HAD
OUR MINDS NOT BEEN POISONED BY THE TRAGEDY WE HAD WITNESSED THE
VILLAGE OF FULWORTH LIES IN A HOLLOW CURVING IN A SEMICIRCLE ROUND
THE BAY BEHIND THE OLDFASHIONED HAMLET SEVERAL MODERN HOUSES HAVE
BEEN BUILT UPON THE RISING GROUND IT WAS TO ONE OF THESE THAT
STACKHURST GUIDED ME
THATS THE HAVEN AS BELLAMY CALLED IT THE ONE WITH THE CORNER
TOWER AND SLATE ROOF NOT BAD FOR A MAN WHO STARTED WITH NOTHING
BUT BY JOVE LOOK AT THAT
THE GARDEN GATE OF THE HAVEN HAD OPENED AND A MAN HAD EMERGED THERE
WAS NO MISTAKING THAT TALL ANGULAR STRAGGLING FIGURE IT WAS IAN
MURDOCH THE MATHEMATICIAN A MOMENT LATER WE CONFRONTED HIM UPON THE
ROAD
HULLO SAID STACKHURST THE MAN NODDED GAVE US A SIDEWAYS GLANCE
FROM HIS CURIOUS DARK EYES AND WOULD HAVE PASSED US BUT HIS
PRINCIPAL PULLED HIM UP
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE HE ASKED
MURDOCHS FACE FLUSHED WITH ANGER I AM YOUR SUBORDINATE SIR UNDER
YOUR ROOF I AM NOT AWARE THAT I OWE YOU ANY ACCOUNT OF MY PRIVATE
ACTIONS
STACKHURSTS NERVES WERE NEAR THE SURFACE AFTER ALL HE HAD ENDURED
OTHERWISE PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE WAITED NOW HE LOST HIS TEMPER
COMPLETELY
IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOUR ANSWER IS PURE IMPERTINENCE MR MURDOCH
YOUR OWN QUESTION MIGHT PERHAPS COME UNDER THE SAME HEADING
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE HAD TO OVERLOOK YOUR
INSUBORDINATE WAYS IT WILL CERTAINLY BE THE LAST YOU WILL KINDLY
MAKE FRESH ARRANGEMENTS FOR YOUR FUTURE AS SPEEDILY AS YOU CAN
I HAD INTENDED TO DO SO I HAVE LOST TODAY THE ONLY PERSON WHO MADE
THE GABLES HABITABLE
HE STRODE OFF UPON HIS WAY WHILE STACKHURST WITH ANGRY EYES STOOD
GLARING AFTER HIM IS HE NOT AN IMPOSSIBLE INTOLERABLE MAN HE
CRIED
THE ONE THING THAT IMPRESSED ITSELF FORCIBLY UPON MY MIND WAS THAT
MR IAN MURDOCH WAS TAKING THE FIRST CHANCE TO OPEN A PATH OF ESCAPE
FROM THE SCENE OF THE CRIME SUSPICION VAGUE AND NEBULOUS WAS NOW
BEGINNING TO TAKE OUTLINE IN MY MIND PERHAPS THE VISIT TO THE
BELLAMYS MIGHT THROW SOME FURTHER LIGHT UPON THE MATTER STACKHURST
PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER AND WE WENT FORWARD TO THE HOUSE
MR BELLAMY PROVED TO BE A MIDDLEAGED MAN WITH A FLAMING RED BEARD
HE SEEMED TO BE IN A VERY ANGRY MOOD AND HIS FACE WAS SOON AS FLORID
AS HIS HAIR
NO SIR I DO NOT DESIRE ANY PARTICULARS MY SON HEREINDICATING A
POWERFUL YOUNG MAN WITH A HEAVY SULLEN FACE IN THE CORNER OF THE
SITTINGROOMIS OF ONE MIND WITH ME THAT MR MCPHERSONS ATTENTIONS
TO MAUD WERE INSULTING YES SIR THE WORD MARRIAGE WAS NEVER
MENTIONED AND YET THERE WERE LETTERS AND MEETINGS AND A GREAT DEAL
MORE OF WHICH NEITHER OF US COULD APPROVE SHE HAS NO MOTHER AND WE
ARE HER ONLY GUARDIANS WE ARE DETERMINED
BUT THE WORDS WERE TAKEN FROM HIS MOUTH BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE LADY
HERSELF THERE WAS NO GAINSAYING THAT SHE WOULD HAVE GRACED ANY
ASSEMBLY IN THE WORLD WHO COULD HAVE IMAGINED THAT SO RARE A FLOWER
WOULD GROW FROM SUCH A ROOT AND IN SUCH AN ATMOSPHERE WOMEN HAVE
SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY
HEART BUT I COULD NOT LOOK UPON HER PERFECT CLEARCUT FACE WITH ALL
THE SOFT FRESHNESS OF THE DOWNLANDS IN HER DELICATE COLOURING
WITHOUT REALIZING THAT NO YOUNG MAN WOULD CROSS HER PATH UNSCATHED
SUCH WAS THE GIRL WHO HAD PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND STOOD NOW
WIDEEYED AND INTENSE IN FRONT OF HAROLD STACKHURST
I KNOW ALREADY THAT FITZROY IS DEAD SHE SAID DO NOT BE AFRAID TO
TELL ME THE PARTICULARS
THIS OTHER GENTLEMAN OF YOURS LET US KNOW THE NEWS EXPLAINED THE
FATHER
THERE IS NO REASON WHY MY SISTER SHOULD BE BROUGHT INTO THE MATTER
GROWLED THE YOUNGER MAN
THE SISTER TURNED A SHARP FIERCE LOOK UPON HIM THIS IS MY
BUSINESS WILLIAM KINDLY LEAVE ME TO MANAGE IT IN MY OWN WAY BY ALL
ACCOUNTS THERE HAS BEEN A CRIME COMMITTED IF I CAN HELP TO SHOW WHO
DID IT IT IS THE LEAST I CAN DO FOR HIM WHO IS GONE
SHE LISTENED TO A SHORT ACCOUNT FROM MY COMPANION WITH A COMPOSED
CONCENTRATION WHICH SHOWED ME THAT SHE POSSESSED STRONG CHARACTER AS
WELL AS GREAT BEAUTY MAUD BELLAMY WILL ALWAYS REMAIN IN MY MEMORY AS
A MOST COMPLETE AND REMARKABLE WOMAN IT SEEMS THAT SHE ALREADY KNEW
ME BY SIGHT FOR SHE TURNED TO ME AT THE END
BRING THEM TO JUSTICE MR HOLMES YOU HAVE MY SYMPATHY AND MY HELP
WHOEVER THEY MAY BE IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SHE GLANCED DEFIANTLY AT
HER FATHER AND BROTHER AS SHE SPOKE
THANK YOU SAID I I VALUE A WOMANS INSTINCT IN SUCH MATTERS YOU
USE THE WORD THEY YOU THINK THAT MORE THAN ONE WAS CONCERNED
I KNEW MR MCPHERSON WELL ENOUGH TO BE AWARE THAT HE WAS A BRAVE AND
A STRONG MAN NO SINGLE PERSON COULD EVER HAVE INFLICTED SUCH AN
OUTRAGE UPON HIM
MIGHT I HAVE ONE WORD WITH YOU ALONE
I TELL YOU MAUD NOT TO MIX YOURSELF UP IN THE MATTER CRIED HER
FATHER ANGRILY
SHE LOOKED AT ME HELPLESSLY WHAT CAN I DO
THE WHOLE WORLD WILL KNOW THE FACTS PRESENTLY SO THERE CAN BE NO
HARM IF I DISCUSS THEM HERE SAID I I SHOULD HAVE PREFERRED
PRIVACY BUT IF YOUR FATHER WILL NOT ALLOW IT HE MUST SHARE THE
DELIBERATIONS THEN I SPOKE OF THE NOTE WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE
DEAD MANS POCKET IT IS SURE TO BE PRODUCED AT THE INQUEST MAY I
ASK YOU TO THROW ANY LIGHT UPON IT THAT YOU CAN
I SEE NO REASON FOR MYSTERY SHE ANSWERED WE WERE ENGAGED TO BE
MARRIED AND WE ONLY KEPT IT SECRET BECAUSE FITZROYS UNCLE WHO IS
VERY OLD AND SAID TO BE DYING MIGHT HAVE DISINHERITED HIM IF HE HAD
MARRIED AGAINST HIS WISH THERE WAS NO OTHER REASON
YOU COULD HAVE TOLD US GROWLED MR BELLAMY
SO I WOULD FATHER IF YOU HAD EVER SHOWN SYMPATHY
I OBJECT TO MY GIRL PICKING UP WITH MEN OUTSIDE HER OWN STATION
IT WAS YOUR PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM WHICH PREVENTED US FROM TELLING
YOU AS TO THIS APPOINTMENTSHE FUMBLED IN HER DRESS AND PRODUCED A
CRUMPLED NOTEIT WAS IN ANSWER TO THIS
DEAREST RAN THE MESSAGE
THE OLD PLACE ON THE BEACH JUST AFTER SUNSET ON TUESDAY IT IS THE
ONLY TIME I CAN GET AWAY
F M
TUESDAY WAS TODAY AND I HAD MEANT TO MEET HIM TONIGHT
I TURNED OVER THE PAPER THIS NEVER CAME BY POST HOW DID YOU GET
IT
I WOULD RATHER NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION IT HAS REALLY NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE MATTER WHICH YOU ARE INVESTIGATING BUT ANYTHING WHICH BEARS
UPON THAT I WILL MOST FREELY ANSWER
SHE WAS AS GOOD AS HER WORD BUT THERE WAS NOTHING WHICH WAS HELPFUL
IN OUR INVESTIGATION SHE HAD NO REASON TO THINK THAT HER FIANCE HAD
ANY HIDDEN ENEMY BUT SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE HAD HAD SEVERAL WARM
ADMIRERS
MAY I ASK IF MR IAN MURDOCH WAS ONE OF THEM
SHE BLUSHED AND SEEMED CONFUSED
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I THOUGHT HE WAS BUT THAT WAS ALL CHANGED
WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD THE RELATIONS BETWEEN FITZROY AND MYSELF
AGAIN THE SHADOW ROUND THIS STRANGE MAN SEEMED TO ME TO BE TAKING
MORE DEFINITE SHAPE HIS RECORD MUST BE EXAMINED HIS ROOMS MUST BE
PRIVATELY SEARCHED STACKHURST WAS A WILLING COLLABORATOR FOR IN HIS
MIND ALSO SUSPICIONS WERE FORMING WE RETURNED FROM OUR VISIT TO THE
HAVEN WITH THE HOPE THAT ONE FREE END OF THIS TANGLED SKEIN WAS
ALREADY IN OUR HANDS
A WEEK PASSED THE INQUEST HAD THROWN NO LIGHT UPON THE MATTER AND
HAD BEEN ADJOURNED FOR FURTHER EVIDENCE STACKHURST HAD MADE DISCREET
INQUIRY ABOUT HIS SUBORDINATE AND THERE HAD BEEN A SUPERFICIAL
SEARCH OF HIS ROOM BUT WITHOUT RESULT PERSONALLY I HAD GONE OVER
THE WHOLE GROUND AGAIN BOTH PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY BUT WITH NO NEW
CONCLUSIONS IN ALL MY CHRONICLES THE READER WILL FIND NO CASE WHICH
BROUGHT ME SO COMPLETELY TO THE LIMIT OF MY POWERS EVEN MY
IMAGINATION COULD CONCEIVE NO SOLUTION TO THE MYSTERY AND THEN THERE
CAME THE INCIDENT OF THE DOG
IT WAS MY OLD HOUSEKEEPER WHO HEARD OF IT FIRST BY THAT STRANGE
WIRELESS BY WHICH SUCH PEOPLE COLLECT THE NEWS OF THE COUNTRYSIDE
SAD STORY THIS SIR ABOUT MR MCPHERSONS DOG SAID SHE ONE
EVENING
I DO NOT ENCOURAGE SUCH CONVERSATIONS BUT THE WORDS ARRESTED MY
ATTENTION
WHAT OF MR MCPHERSONS DOG
DEAD SIR DIED OF GRIEF FOR ITS MASTER
WHO TOLD YOU THIS
WHY SIR EVERYONE IS TALKING OF IT IT TOOK ON TERRIBLE AND HAS
EATEN NOTHING FOR A WEEK THEN TODAY TWO OF THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN FROM
THE GABLES FOUND IT DEADDOWN ON THE BEACH SIR AT THE VERY PLACE
WHERE ITS MASTER MET HIS END
AT THE VERY PLACE THE WORDS STOOD OUT CLEAR IN MY MEMORY SOME DIM
PERCEPTION THAT THE MATTER WAS VITAL ROSE IN MY MIND THAT THE DOG
SHOULD DIE WAS AFTER THE BEAUTIFUL FAITHFUL NATURE OF DOGS BUT IN
THE VERY PLACE WHY SHOULD THIS LONELY BEACH BE FATAL TO IT WAS IT
POSSIBLE THAT IT ALSO HAD BEEN SACRIFICED TO SOME REVENGEFUL FEUD
WAS IT POSSIBLE YES THE PERCEPTION WAS DIM BUT ALREADY SOMETHING
WAS BUILDING UP IN MY MIND IN A FEW MINUTES I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE
GABLES WHERE I FOUND STACKHURST IN HIS STUDY AT MY REQUEST HE SENT
FOR SUDBURY AND BLOUNT THE TWO STUDENTS WHO HAD FOUND THE DOG
YES IT LAY ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE POOL SAID ONE OF THEM IT
MUST HAVE FOLLOWED THE TRAIL OF ITS DEAD MASTER
I SAW THE FAITHFUL LITTLE CREATURE AN AIREDALE TERRIER LAID OUT
UPON THE MAT IN THE HALL THE BODY WAS STIFF AND RIGID THE EYES
PROJECTING AND THE LIMBS CONTORTED THERE WAS AGONY IN EVERY LINE OF
IT
FROM THE GABLES I WALKED DOWN TO THE BATHINGPOOL THE SUN HAD SUNK
AND THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT CLIFF LAY BLACK ACROSS THE WATER WHICH
GLIMMERED DULLY LIKE A SHEET OF LEAD THE PLACE WAS DESERTED AND
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF LIFE SAVE FOR TWO SEABIRDS CIRCLING AND
SCREAMING OVERHEAD IN THE FADING LIGHT I COULD DIMLY MAKE OUT THE
LITTLE DOGS SPOOR UPON THE SAND ROUND THE VERY ROCK ON WHICH HIS
MASTERS TOWEL HAD BEEN LAID FOR A LONG TIME I STOOD IN DEEP
MEDITATION WHILE THE SHADOWS GREW DARKER AROUND ME MY MIND WAS
FILLED WITH RACING THOUGHTS YOU HAVE KNOWN WHAT IT WAS TO BE IN A
NIGHTMARE IN WHICH YOU FEEL THAT THERE IS SOME ALLIMPORTANT THING
FOR WHICH YOU SEARCH AND WHICH YOU KNOW IS THERE THOUGH IT REMAINS
FOREVER JUST BEYOND YOUR REACH THAT WAS HOW I FELT THAT EVENING AS I
STOOD ALONE BY THAT PLACE OF DEATH THEN AT LAST I TURNED AND WALKED
SLOWLY HOMEWARD
I HAD JUST REACHED THE TOP OF THE PATH WHEN IT CAME TO ME LIKE A
FLASH I REMEMBERED THE THING FOR WHICH I HAD SO EAGERLY AND VAINLY
GRASPED YOU WILL KNOW OR WATSON HAS WRITTEN IN VAIN THAT I HOLD A
VAST STORE OF OUTOFTHEWAY KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT SCIENTIFIC SYSTEM BUT
VERY AVAILABLE FOR THE NEEDS OF MY WORK MY MIND IS LIKE A CROWDED
BOXROOM WITH PACKETS OF ALL SORTS STOWED AWAY THEREINSO MANY THAT
I MAY WELL HAVE BUT A VAGUE PERCEPTION OF WHAT WAS THERE I HAD KNOWN
THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WHICH MIGHT BEAR UPON THIS MATTER IT WAS
STILL VAGUE BUT AT LEAST I KNEW HOW I COULD MAKE IT CLEAR IT WAS
MONSTROUS INCREDIBLE AND YET IT WAS ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY I WOULD
TEST IT TO THE FULL
THERE IS A GREAT GARRET IN MY LITTLE HOUSE WHICH IS STUFFED WITH
BOOKS IT WAS INTO THIS THAT I PLUNGED AND RUMMAGED FOR AN HOUR AT
THE END OF THAT TIME I EMERGED WITH A LITTLE CHOCOLATE AND SILVER
VOLUME EAGERLY I TURNED UP THE CHAPTER OF WHICH I HAD A DIM
REMEMBRANCE YES IT WAS INDEED A FARFETCHED AND UNLIKELY
PROPOSITION AND YET I COULD NOT BE AT REST UNTIL I HAD MADE SURE IF
IT MIGHT INDEED BE SO IT WAS LATE WHEN I RETIRED WITH MY MIND
EAGERLY AWAITING THE WORK OF THE MORROW
BUT THAT WORK MET WITH AN ANNOYING INTERRUPTION I HAD HARDLY
SWALLOWED MY EARLY CUP OF TEA AND WAS STARTING FOR THE BEACH WHEN I
HAD A CALL FROM INSPECTOR BARDLE OF THE SUSSEX CONSTABULARYA
STEADY SOLID BOVINE MAN WITH THOUGHTFUL EYES WHICH LOOKED AT ME
NOW WITH A VERY TROUBLED EXPRESSION
I KNOW YOUR IMMENSE EXPERIENCE SIR SAID HE THIS IS QUITE
UNOFFICIAL OF COURSE AND NEED GO NO FARTHER BUT I AM FAIRLY UP
AGAINST IT IN THIS MCPHERSON CASE THE QUESTION IS SHALL I MAKE AN
ARREST OR SHALL I NOT
MEANING MR IAN MURDOCH
YES SIR THERE IS REALLY NO ONE ELSE WHEN YOU COME TO THINK OF IT
THATS THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SOLITUDE WE NARROW IT DOWN TO A VERY
SMALL COMPASS IF HE DID NOT DO IT THEN WHO DID
WHAT HAVE YOU AGAINST HIM
HE HAD GLEANED ALONG THE SAME FURROWS AS I HAD THERE WAS MURDOCHS
CHARACTER AND THE MYSTERY WHICH SEEMED TO HANG ROUND THE MAN HIS
FURIOUS BURSTS OF TEMPER AS SHOWN IN THE INCIDENT OF THE DOG THE
FACT THAT HE HAD QUARRELLED WITH MCPHERSON IN THE PAST AND THAT
THERE WAS SOME REASON TO THINK THAT HE MIGHT HAVE RESENTED HIS
ATTENTIONS TO MISS BELLAMY HE HAD ALL MY POINTS BUT NO FRESH ONES
SAVE THAT MURDOCH SEEMED TO BE MAKING EVERY PREPARATION FOR
DEPARTURE
WHAT WOULD MY POSITION BE IF I LET HIM SLIP AWAY WITH ALL THIS
EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM THE BURLY PHLEGMATIC MAN WAS SORELY TROUBLED
IN HIS MIND
CONSIDER I SAID ALL THE ESSENTIAL GAPS IN YOUR CASE ON THE
MORNING OF THE CRIME HE CAN SURELY PROVE AN ALIBI HE HAD BEEN WITH
HIS SCHOLARS TILL THE LAST MOMENT AND WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF
MCPHERSONS APPEARANCE HE CAME UPON US FROM BEHIND THEN BEAR IN MIND
THE ABSOLUTE IMPOSSIBILITY THAT HE COULD SINGLEHANDED HAVE INFLICTED
THIS OUTRAGE UPON A MAN QUITE AS STRONG AS HIMSELF FINALLY THERE IS
THIS QUESTION OF THE INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH THESE INJURIES WERE
INFLICTED
WHAT COULD IT BE BUT A SCOURGE OR FLEXIBLE WHIP OF SOME SORT
HAVE YOU EXAMINED THE MARKS I ASKED
I HAVE SEEN THEM SO HAS THE DOCTOR
BUT I HAVE EXAMINED THEM VERY CAREFULLY WITH A LENS THEY HAVE
PECULIARITIES
WHAT ARE THEY MR HOLMES
I STEPPED TO MY BUREAU AND BROUGHT OUT AN ENLARGED PHOTOGRAPH THIS
IS MY METHOD IN SUCH CASES I EXPLAINED
YOU CERTAINLY DO THINGS THOROUGHLY MR HOLMES
I SHOULD HARDLY BE WHAT I AM IF I DID NOT NOW LET US CONSIDER THIS
WEAL WHICH EXTENDS ROUND THE RIGHT SHOULDER DO YOU OBSERVE NOTHING
REMARKABLE
I CANT SAY I DO
SURELY IT IS EVIDENT THAT IT IS UNEQUAL IN ITS INTENSITY THERE IS A
DOT OF EXTRAVASATED BLOOD HERE AND ANOTHER THERE THERE ARE SIMILAR
INDICATIONS IN THIS OTHER WEAL DOWN HERE WHAT CAN THAT MEAN
I HAVE NO IDEA HAVE YOU
PERHAPS I HAVE PERHAPS I HAVENT I MAY BE ABLE TO SAY MORE SOON
ANYTHING WHICH WILL DEFINE WHAT MADE THAT MARK WILL BRING US A LONG
WAY TOWARDS THE CRIMINAL
IT IS OF COURSE AN ABSURD IDEA SAID THE POLICEMAN BUT IF A
REDHOT NET OF WIRE HAD BEEN LAID ACROSS THE BACK THEN THESE BETTER
MARKED POINTS WOULD REPRESENT WHERE THE MESHES CROSSED EACH OTHER
A MOST INGENIOUS COMPARISON OR SHALL WE SAY A VERY STIFF
CATONINETAILS WITH SMALL HARD KNOTS UPON IT
BY JOVE MR HOLMES I THINK YOU HAVE HIT IT
OR THERE MAY BE SOME VERY DIFFERENT CAUSE MR BARDLE BUT YOUR CASE
IS FAR TOO WEAK FOR AN ARREST BESIDES WE HAVE THOSE LAST WORDSTHE
LIONS MANE
I HAVE WONDERED WHETHER IAN
YES I HAVE CONSIDERED THAT IF THE SECOND WORD HAD BORNE ANY
RESEMBLANCE TO MURDOCHBUT IT DID NOT HE GAVE IT ALMOST IN A
SHRIEK I AM SURE THAT IT WAS MANE
HAVE YOU NO ALTERNATIVE MR HOLMES
PERHAPS I HAVE BUT I DO NOT CARE TO DISCUSS IT UNTIL THERE IS
SOMETHING MORE SOLID TO DISCUSS
AND WHEN WILL THAT BE
IN AN HOURPOSSIBLY LESS
THE INSPECTOR RUBBED HIS CHIN AND LOOKED AT ME WITH DUBIOUS EYES
I WISH I COULD SEE WHAT WAS IN YOUR MIND MR HOLMES PERHAPS ITS
THOSE FISHINGBOATS
NO NO THEY WERE TOO FAR OUT
WELL THEN IS IT BELLAMY AND THAT BIG SON OF HIS THEY WERE NOT TOO
SWEET UPON MR MCPHERSON COULD THEY HAVE DONE HIM A MISCHIEF
NO NO YOU WONT DRAW ME UNTIL I AM READY SAID I WITH A SMILE
NOW INSPECTOR WE EACH HAVE OUR OWN WORK TO DO PERHAPS IF YOU WERE
TO MEET ME HERE AT MIDDAY
SO FAR WE HAD GOT WHEN THERE CAME THE TREMENDOUS INTERRUPTION WHICH
WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE END
MY OUTER DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN THERE WERE BLUNDERING FOOTSTEPS IN THE
PASSAGE AND IAN MURDOCH STAGGERED INTO THE ROOM PALLID
DISHEVELLED HIS CLOTHES IN WILD DISORDER CLAWING WITH HIS BONY
HANDS AT THE FURNITURE TO HOLD HIMSELF ERECT BRANDY BRANDY HE
GASPED AND FELL GROANING UPON THE SOFA
HE WAS NOT ALONE BEHIND HIM CAME STACKHURST HATLESS AND PANTING
ALMOST AS DISTRAIT AS HIS COMPANION
YES YES BRANDY HE CRIED THE MAN IS AT HIS LAST GASP IT WAS
ALL I COULD DO TO BRING HIM HERE HE FAINTED TWICE UPON THE WAY
HALF A TUMBLER OF THE RAW SPIRIT BROUGHT ABOUT A WONDROUS CHANGE HE
PUSHED HIMSELF UP ON ONE ARM AND SWUNG HIS COAT FROM HIS SHOULDERS
FOR GODS SAKE OIL OPIUM MORPHIA HE CRIED ANYTHING TO EASE
THIS INFERNAL AGONY
THE INSPECTOR AND I CRIED OUT AT THE SIGHT THERE CRISSCROSSED UPON
THE MANS NAKED SHOULDER WAS THE SAME STRANGE RETICULATED PATTERN OF
RED INFLAMED LINES WHICH HAD BEEN THE DEATHMARK OF FITZROY
MCPHERSON
THE PAIN WAS EVIDENTLY TERRIBLE AND WAS MORE THAN LOCAL FOR THE
SUFFERERS BREATHING WOULD STOP FOR A TIME HIS FACE WOULD TURN
BLACK AND THEN WITH LOUD GASPS HE WOULD CLAP HIS HAND TO HIS HEART
WHILE HIS BROW DROPPED BEADS OF SWEAT AT ANY MOMENT HE MIGHT DIE
MORE AND MORE BRANDY WAS POURED DOWN HIS THROAT EACH FRESH DOSE
BRINGING HIM BACK TO LIFE PADS OF COTTONWOOL SOAKED IN SALADOIL
SEEMED TO TAKE THE AGONY FROM THE STRANGE WOUNDS AT LAST HIS HEAD
FELL HEAVILY UPON THE CUSHION EXHAUSTED NATURE HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN
ITS LAST STOREHOUSE OF VITALITY IT WAS HALF A SLEEP AND HALF A
FAINT BUT AT LEAST IT WAS EASE FROM PAIN
TO QUESTION HIM HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE BUT THE MOMENT WE WERE ASSURED
OF HIS CONDITION STACKHURST TURNED UPON ME
MY GOD HE CRIED WHAT IS IT HOLMES WHAT IS IT
WHERE DID YOU FIND HIM
DOWN ON THE BEACH EXACTLY WHERE POOR MCPHERSON MET HIS END IF THIS
MANS HEART HAD BEEN WEAK AS MCPHERSONS WAS HE WOULD NOT BE HERE
NOW MORE THAN ONCE I THOUGHT HE WAS GONE AS I BROUGHT HIM UP IT WAS
TOO FAR TO THE GABLES SO I MADE FOR YOU
DID YOU SEE HIM ON THE BEACH
I WAS WALKING ON THE CLIFF WHEN I HEARD HIS CRY HE WAS AT THE EDGE
OF THE WATER REELING ABOUT LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN I RAN DOWN THREW
SOME CLOTHES ABOUT HIM AND BROUGHT HIM UP FOR HEAVENS SAKE
HOLMES USE ALL THE POWERS YOU HAVE AND SPARE NO PAINS TO LIFT THE
CURSE FROM THIS PLACE FOR LIFE IS BECOMING UNENDURABLE CAN YOU
WITH ALL YOUR WORLDWIDE REPUTATION DO NOTHING FOR US
I THINK I CAN STACKHURST COME WITH ME NOW AND YOU INSPECTOR
COME ALONG WE WILL SEE IF WE CANNOT DELIVER THIS MURDERER INTO YOUR
HANDS
LEAVING THE UNCONSCIOUS MAN IN THE CHARGE OF MY HOUSEKEEPER WE ALL
THREE WENT DOWN TO THE DEADLY LAGOON ON THE SHINGLE THERE WAS PILED
A LITTLE HEAP OF TOWELS AND CLOTHES LEFT BY THE STRICKEN MAN SLOWLY
I WALKED ROUND THE EDGE OF THE WATER MY COMRADES IN INDIAN FILE
BEHIND ME MOST OF THE POOL WAS QUITE SHALLOW BUT UNDER THE CLIFF
WHERE THE BEACH WAS HOLLOWED OUT IT WAS FOUR OR FIVE FEET DEEP IT
WAS TO THIS PART THAT A SWIMMER WOULD NATURALLY GO FOR IT FORMED A
BEAUTIFUL PELLUCID GREEN POOL AS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL A LINE OF ROCKS
LAY ABOVE IT AT THE BASE OF THE CLIFF AND ALONG THIS I LED THE WAY
PEERING EAGERLY INTO THE DEPTHS BENEATH ME I HAD REACHED THE DEEPEST
AND STILLEST POOL WHEN MY EYES CAUGHT THAT FOR WHICH THEY WERE
SEARCHING AND I BURST INTO A SHOUT OF TRIUMPH
CYANEA I CRIED CYANEA BEHOLD THE LIONS MANE
THE STRANGE OBJECT AT WHICH I POINTED DID INDEED LOOK LIKE A TANGLED
MASS TORN FROM THE MANE OF A LION IT LAY UPON A ROCKY SHELF SOME
THREE FEET UNDER THE WATER A CURIOUS WAVING VIBRATING HAIRY
CREATURE WITH STREAKS OF SILVER AMONG ITS YELLOW TRESSES IT PULSATED
WITH A SLOW HEAVY DILATION AND CONTRACTION
IT HAS DONE MISCHIEF ENOUGH ITS DAY IS OVER I CRIED HELP ME
STACKHURST LET US END THE MURDERER FOREVER
THERE WAS A BIG BOULDER JUST ABOVE THE LEDGE AND WE PUSHED IT UNTIL
IT FELL WITH A TREMENDOUS SPLASH INTO THE WATER WHEN THE RIPPLES HAD
CLEARED WE SAW THAT IT HAD SETTLED UPON THE LEDGE BELOW ONE FLAPPING
EDGE OF YELLOW MEMBRANE SHOWED THAT OUR VICTIM WAS BENEATH IT A
THICK OILY SCUM OOZED OUT FROM BELOW THE STONE AND STAINED THE WATER
ROUND RISING SLOWLY TO THE SURFACE
WELL THIS GETS ME CRIED THE INSPECTOR WHAT WAS IT MR HOLMES
IM BORN AND BRED IN THESE PARTS BUT I NEVER SAW SUCH A THING IT
DONT BELONG TO SUSSEX
JUST AS WELL FOR SUSSEX I REMARKED IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE
SOUTHWEST GALE THAT BROUGHT IT UP COME BACK TO MY HOUSE BOTH OF
YOU AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF ONE WHO HAS GOOD
REASON TO REMEMBER HIS OWN MEETING WITH THE SAME PERIL OF THE SEAS
WHEN WE REACHED MY STUDY WE FOUND THAT MURDOCH WAS SO FAR RECOVERED
THAT HE COULD SIT UP HE WAS DAZED IN MIND AND EVERY NOW AND THEN
WAS SHAKEN BY A PAROXYSM OF PAIN IN BROKEN WORDS HE EXPLAINED THAT
HE HAD NO NOTION WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM SAVE THAT TERRIFIC PANGS
HAD SUDDENLY SHOT THROUGH HIM AND THAT IT HAD TAKEN ALL HIS
FORTITUDE TO REACH THE BANK
HERE IS A BOOK I SAID TAKING UP THE LITTLE VOLUME WHICH FIRST
BROUGHT LIGHT INTO WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOREVER DARK IT IS OUT OF
DOORS BY THE FAMOUS OBSERVER J G WOOD WOOD HIMSELF VERY NEARLY
PERISHED FROM CONTACT WITH THIS VILE CREATURE SO HE WROTE WITH A
VERY FULL KNOWLEDGE CYANEA CAPILLATA IS THE MISCREANTS FULL NAME
AND HE CAN BE AS DANGEROUS TO LIFE AS AND FAR MORE PAINFUL THAN THE
BITE OF THE COBRA LET ME BRIEFLY GIVE THIS EXTRACT
IF THE BATHER SHOULD SEE A LOOSE ROUNDISH MASS OF TAWNY MEMBRANES
AND FIBRES SOMETHING LIKE VERY LARGE HANDFULS OF LIONS MANE AND
SILVER PAPER LET HIM BEWARE FOR THIS IS THE FEARFUL STINGER CYANEA
CAPILLATA
COULD OUR SINISTER ACQUAINTANCE BE MORE CLEARLY DESCRIBED
HE GOES ON TO TELL OF HIS OWN ENCOUNTER WITH ONE WHEN SWIMMING OFF
THE COAST OF KENT HE FOUND THAT THE CREATURE RADIATED ALMOST
INVISIBLE FILAMENTS TO THE DISTANCE OF FIFTY FEET AND THAT ANYONE
WITHIN THAT CIRCUMFERENCE FROM THE DEADLY CENTRE WAS IN DANGER OF
DEATH EVEN AT A DISTANCE THE EFFECT UPON WOOD WAS ALMOST FATAL
THE MULTITUDINOUS THREADS CAUSED LIGHT SCARLET LINES UPON THE SKIN
WHICH ON CLOSER EXAMINATION RESOLVED INTO MINUTE DOTS OR PUSTULES
EACH DOT CHARGED AS IT WERE WITH A REDHOT NEEDLE MAKING ITS WAY
THROUGH THE NERVES
THE LOCAL PAIN WAS AS HE EXPLAINS THE LEAST PART OF THE EXQUISITE
TORMENT
PANGS SHOT THROUGH THE CHEST CAUSING ME TO FALL AS IF STRUCK BY A
BULLET THE PULSATION WOULD CEASE AND THEN THE HEART WOULD GIVE SIX
OR SEVEN LEAPS AS IF IT WOULD FORCE ITS WAY THROUGH THE CHEST
IT NEARLY KILLED HIM ALTHOUGH HE HAD ONLY BEEN EXPOSED TO IT IN THE
DISTURBED OCEAN AND NOT IN THE NARROW CALM WATERS OF A BATHINGPOOL
HE SAYS THAT HE COULD HARDLY RECOGNIZE HIMSELF AFTERWARDS SO WHITE
WRINKLED AND SHRIVELLED WAS HIS FACE HE GULPED DOWN BRANDY A WHOLE
BOTTLEFUL AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE SAVED HIS LIFE THERE IS THE BOOK
INSPECTOR I LEAVE IT WITH YOU AND YOU CANNOT DOUBT THAT IT CONTAINS
A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE TRAGEDY OF POOR MCPHERSON
AND INCIDENTALLY EXONERATES ME REMARKED IAN MURDOCH WITH A WRY
SMILE I DO NOT BLAME YOU INSPECTOR NOR YOU MR HOLMES FOR YOUR
SUSPICIONS WERE NATURAL I FEEL THAT ON THE VERY EVE OF MY ARREST I
HAVE ONLY CLEARED MYSELF BY SHARING THE FATE OF MY POOR FRIEND
NO MR MURDOCH I WAS ALREADY UPON THE TRACK AND HAD I BEEN OUT AS
EARLY AS I INTENDED I MIGHT WELL HAVE SAVED YOU FROM THIS TERRIFIC
EXPERIENCE
BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW MR HOLMES
I AM AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR
TRIFLES THAT PHRASE THE LIONS MANE HAUNTED MY MIND I KNEW THAT I
HAD SEEN IT SOMEWHERE IN AN UNEXPECTED CONTEXT YOU HAVE SEEN THAT IT
DOES DESCRIBE THE CREATURE I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS FLOATING ON
THE WATER WHEN MCPHERSON SAW IT AND THAT THIS PHRASE WAS THE ONLY
ONE BY WHICH HE COULD CONVEY TO US A WARNING AS TO THE CREATURE WHICH
HAD BEEN HIS DEATH
THEN I AT LEAST AM CLEARED SAID MURDOCH RISING SLOWLY TO HIS
FEET THERE ARE ONE OR TWO WORDS OF EXPLANATION WHICH I SHOULD GIVE
FOR I KNOW THE DIRECTION IN WHICH YOUR INQUIRIES HAVE RUN IT IS TRUE
THAT I LOVED THIS LADY BUT FROM THE DAY WHEN SHE CHOSE MY FRIEND
MCPHERSON MY ONE DESIRE WAS TO HELP HER TO HAPPINESS I WAS WELL
CONTENT TO STAND ASIDE AND ACT AS THEIR GOBETWEEN OFTEN I CARRIED
THEIR MESSAGES AND IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS IN THEIR CONFIDENCE AND
BECAUSE SHE WAS SO DEAR TO ME THAT I HASTENED TO TELL HER OF MY
FRIENDS DEATH LEST SOMEONE SHOULD FORESTALL ME IN A MORE SUDDEN AND
HEARTLESS MANNER SHE WOULD NOT TELL YOU SIR OF OUR RELATIONS LEST
YOU SHOULD DISAPPROVE AND I MIGHT SUFFER BUT WITH YOUR LEAVE I MUST
TRY TO GET BACK TO THE GABLES FOR MY BED WILL BE VERY WELCOME
STACKHURST HELD OUT HIS HAND OUR NERVES HAVE ALL BEEN AT
CONCERTPITCH SAID HE FORGIVE WHAT IS PAST MURDOCH WE SHALL
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER BETTER IN THE FUTURE THEY PASSED OUT TOGETHER
WITH THEIR ARMS LINKED IN FRIENDLY FASHION THE INSPECTOR REMAINED
STARING AT ME IN SILENCE WITH HIS OXLIKE EYES
WELL YOUVE DONE IT HE CRIED AT LAST I HAD READ OF YOU BUT I
NEVER BELIEVED IT ITS WONDERFUL
I WAS FORCED TO SHAKE MY HEAD TO ACCEPT SUCH PRAISE WAS TO LOWER
ONES OWN STANDARDS
I WAS SLOW AT THE OUTSETCULPABLY SLOW HAD THE BODY BEEN FOUND IN
THE WATER I COULD HARDLY HAVE MISSED IT IT WAS THE TOWEL WHICH
MISLED ME THE POOR FELLOW HAD NEVER THOUGHT TO DRY HIMSELF AND SO I
IN TURN WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN THE WATER WHY
THEN SHOULD THE ATTACK OF ANY WATER CREATURE SUGGEST ITSELF TO ME
THAT WAS WHERE I WENT ASTRAY WELL WELL INSPECTOR I OFTEN VENTURED
TO CHAFF YOU GENTLEMEN OF THE POLICE FORCE BUT CYANEA CAPILLATA VERY
NEARLY AVENGED SCOTLAND YARD
THE ADVENTURE OF THE VEILED LODGER
WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THAT MR SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS IN ACTIVE PRACTICE
FOR TWENTYTHREE YEARS AND THAT DURING SEVENTEEN OF THESE I WAS
ALLOWED TO COOPERATE WITH HIM AND TO KEEP NOTES OF HIS DOINGS IT
WILL BE CLEAR THAT I HAVE A MASS OF MATERIAL AT MY COMMAND THE
PROBLEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN NOT TO FIND BUT TO CHOOSE THERE IS THE LONG
ROW OF YEARBOOKS WHICH FILL A SHELF AND THERE ARE THE
DISPATCHCASES FILLED WITH DOCUMENTS A PERFECT QUARRY FOR THE
STUDENT NOT ONLY OF CRIME BUT OF THE SOCIAL AND OFFICIAL SCANDALS OF
THE LATE VICTORIAN ERA CONCERNING THESE LATTER I MAY SAY THAT THE
WRITERS OF AGONIZED LETTERS WHO BEG THAT THE HONOUR OF THEIR
FAMILIES OR THE REPUTATION OF FAMOUS FOREBEARS MAY NOT BE TOUCHED
HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR THE DISCRETION AND HIGH SENSE OF PROFESSIONAL
HONOUR WHICH HAVE ALWAYS DISTINGUISHED MY FRIEND ARE STILL AT WORK IN
THE CHOICE OF THESE MEMOIRS AND NO CONFIDENCE WILL BE ABUSED I
DEPRECATE HOWEVER IN THE STRONGEST WAY THE ATTEMPTS WHICH HAVE BEEN
MADE LATELY TO GET AT AND TO DESTROY THESE PAPERS THE SOURCE OF
THESE OUTRAGES IS KNOWN AND IF THEY ARE REPEATED I HAVE MR HOLMESS
AUTHORITY FOR SAYING THAT THE WHOLE STORY CONCERNING THE POLITICIAN
THE LIGHTHOUSE AND THE TRAINED CORMORANT WILL BE GIVEN TO THE
PUBLIC THERE IS AT LEAST ONE READER WHO WILL UNDERSTAND
IT IS NOT REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT EVERY ONE OF THESE CASES GAVE
HOLMES THE OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING THOSE CURIOUS GIFTS OF INSTINCT AND
OBSERVATION WHICH I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO SET FORTH IN THESE MEMOIRS
SOMETIMES HE HAD WITH MUCH EFFORT TO PICK THE FRUIT SOMETIMES IT
FELL EASILY INTO HIS LAP BUT THE MOST TERRIBLE HUMAN TRAGEDIES WERE
OFTEN INVOLVED IN THOSE CASES WHICH BROUGHT HIM THE FEWEST PERSONAL
OPPORTUNITIES AND IT IS ONE OF THESE WHICH I NOW DESIRE TO RECORD
IN TELLING IT I HAVE MADE A SLIGHT CHANGE OF NAME AND PLACE BUT
OTHERWISE THE FACTS ARE AS STATED
ONE FORENOONIT WAS LATE IN I RECEIVED A HURRIED NOTE FROM
HOLMES ASKING FOR MY ATTENDANCE WHEN I ARRIVED I FOUND HIM SEATED IN
A SMOKELADEN ATMOSPHERE WITH AN ELDERLY MOTHERLY WOMAN OF THE
BUXOM LANDLADY TYPE IN THE CORRESPONDING CHAIR IN FRONT OF HIM
THIS IS MRS MERRILOW OF SOUTH BRIXTON SAID MY FRIEND WITH A WAVE
OF THE HAND MRS MERRILOW DOES NOT OBJECT TO TOBACCO WATSON IF
YOU WISH TO INDULGE YOUR FILTHY HABITS MRS MERRILOW HAS AN
INTERESTING STORY TO TELL WHICH MAY WELL LEAD TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS
IN WHICH YOUR PRESENCE MAY BE USEFUL
ANYTHING I CAN DO
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND MRS MERRILOW THAT IF I COME TO MRS RONDER I
SHOULD PREFER TO HAVE A WITNESS YOU WILL MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THAT
BEFORE WE ARRIVE
LORD BLESS YOU MR HOLMES SAID OUR VISITOR SHE IS THAT ANXIOUS
TO SEE YOU THAT YOU MIGHT BRING THE WHOLE PARISH AT YOUR HEELS
THEN WE SHALL COME EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON LET US SEE THAT WE HAVE
OUR FACTS CORRECT BEFORE WE START IF WE GO OVER THEM IT WILL HELP
DR WATSON TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION YOU SAY THAT MRS RONDER HAS
BEEN YOUR LODGER FOR SEVEN YEARS AND THAT YOU HAVE ONLY ONCE SEEN HER
FACE
AND I WISH TO GOD I HAD NOT SAID MRS MERRILOW
IT WAS I UNDERSTAND TERRIBLY MUTILATED
WELL MR HOLMES YOU WOULD HARDLY SAY IT WAS A FACE AT ALL THATS
HOW IT LOOKED OUR MILKMAN GOT A GLIMPSE OF HER ONCE PEEPING OUT OF
THE UPPER WINDOW AND HE DROPPED HIS TIN AND THE MILK ALL OVER THE
FRONT GARDEN THAT IS THE KIND OF FACE IT IS WHEN I SAW HERI
HAPPENED ON HER UNAWARESSHE COVERED UP QUICK AND THEN SHE SAID
NOW MRS MERRILOW YOU KNOW AT LAST WHY IT IS THAT I NEVER RAISE MY
VEIL
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HER HISTORY
NOTHING AT ALL
DID SHE GIVE REFERENCES WHEN SHE CAME
NO SIR BUT SHE GAVE HARD CASH AND PLENTY OF IT A QUARTERS RENT
RIGHT DOWN ON THE TABLE IN ADVANCE AND NO ARGUING ABOUT TERMS IN
THESE TIMES A POOR WOMAN LIKE ME CANT AFFORD TO TURN DOWN A CHANCE
LIKE THAT
DID SHE GIVE ANY REASON FOR CHOOSING YOUR HOUSE
MINE STANDS WELL BACK FROM THE ROAD AND IS MORE PRIVATE THAN MOST
THEN AGAIN I ONLY TAKE THE ONE AND I HAVE NO FAMILY OF MY OWN I
RECKON SHE HAD TRIED OTHERS AND FOUND THAT MINE SUITED HER BEST ITS
PRIVACY SHE IS AFTER AND SHE IS READY TO PAY FOR IT
YOU SAY THAT SHE NEVER SHOWED HER FACE FROM FIRST TO LAST SAVE ON
THE ONE ACCIDENTAL OCCASION WELL IT IS A VERY REMARKABLE STORY
MOST REMARKABLE AND I DONT WONDER THAT YOU WANT IT EXAMINED
I DONT MR HOLMES I AM QUITE SATISFIED SO LONG AS I GET MY RENT
YOU COULD NOT HAVE A QUIETER LODGER OR ONE WHO GIVES LESS TROUBLE
THEN WHAT HAS BROUGHT MATTERS TO A HEAD
HER HEALTH MR HOLMES SHE SEEMS TO BE WASTING AWAY AND THERES
SOMETHING TERRIBLE ON HER MIND MURDER SHE CRIES MURDER AND
ONCE I HEARD HER YOU CRUEL BEAST YOU MONSTER SHE CRIED IT WAS
IN THE NIGHT AND IT FAIR RANG THROUGH THE HOUSE AND SENT THE SHIVERS
THROUGH ME SO I WENT TO HER IN THE MORNING MRS RONDER I SAYS
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT IS TROUBLING YOUR SOUL THERES THE
CLERGY I SAYS AND THERES THE POLICE BETWEEN THEM YOU SHOULD GET
SOME HELP FOR GODS SAKE NOT THE POLICE SAYS SHE AND THE
CLERGY CANT CHANGE WHAT IS PAST AND YET SHE SAYS IT WOULD EASE
MY MIND IF SOMEONE KNEW THE TRUTH BEFORE I DIED WELL SAYS I IF
YOU WONT HAVE THE REGULARS THERE IS THIS DETECTIVE MAN WHAT WE READ
ABOUTBEGGIN YOUR PARDON MR HOLMES AND SHE SHE FAIR JUMPED AT
IT THATS THE MAN SAYS SHE I WONDER I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT
BEFORE BRING HIM HERE MRS MERRILOW AND IF HE WONT COME TELL HIM
I AM THE WIFE OF RONDERS WILD BEAST SHOW SAY THAT AND GIVE HIM THE
NAME ABBAS PARVA HERE IT IS AS SHE WROTE IT ABBAS PARVA THAT WILL
BRING HIM IF HES THE MAN I THINK HE IS
AND IT WILL TOO REMARKED HOLMES VERY GOOD MRS MERRILOW I
SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE CHAT WITH DR WATSON THAT WILL CARRY US
TILL LUNCHTIME ABOUT THREE OCLOCK YOU MAY EXPECT TO SEE US AT YOUR
HOUSE IN BRIXTON
OUR VISITOR HAD NO SOONER WADDLED OUT OF THE ROOMNO OTHER VERB CAN
DESCRIBE MRS MERRILOWS METHOD OF PROGRESSIONTHAN SHERLOCK HOLMES
THREW HIMSELF WITH FIERCE ENERGY UPON THE PILE OF COMMONPLACE BOOKS
IN THE CORNER FOR A FEW MINUTES THERE WAS A CONSTANT SWISH OF THE
LEAVES AND THEN WITH A GRUNT OF SATISFACTION HE CAME UPON WHAT HE
SOUGHT SO EXCITED WAS HE THAT HE DID NOT RISE BUT SAT UPON THE
FLOOR LIKE SOME STRANGE BUDDHA WITH CROSSED LEGS THE HUGE BOOKS ALL
ROUND HIM AND ONE OPEN UPON HIS KNEES
THE CASE WORRIED ME AT THE TIME WATSON HERE ARE MY MARGINAL NOTES
TO PROVE IT I CONFESS THAT I COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT AND YET I WAS
CONVINCED THAT THE CORONER WAS WRONG HAVE YOU NO RECOLLECTION OF THE
ABBAS PARVA TRAGEDY
NONE HOLMES
AND YET YOU WERE WITH ME THEN BUT CERTAINLY MY OWN IMPRESSION WAS
VERY SUPERFICIAL FOR THERE WAS NOTHING TO GO BY AND NONE OF THE
PARTIES HAD ENGAGED MY SERVICES PERHAPS YOU WOULD CARE TO READ THE
PAPERS
COULD YOU NOT GIVE ME THE POINTS
THAT IS VERY EASILY DONE IT WILL PROBABLY COME BACK TO YOUR MEMORY
AS I TALK RONDER OF COURSE WAS A HOUSEHOLD WORD HE WAS THE RIVAL
OF WOMBWELL AND OF SANGER ONE OF THE GREATEST SHOWMEN OF HIS DAY
THERE IS EVIDENCE HOWEVER THAT HE TOOK TO DRINK AND THAT BOTH HE
AND HIS SHOW WERE ON THE DOWN GRADE AT THE TIME OF THE GREAT TRAGEDY
THE CARAVAN HAD HALTED FOR THE NIGHT AT ABBAS PARVA WHICH IS A SMALL
VILLAGE IN BERKSHIRE WHEN THIS HORROR OCCURRED THEY WERE ON THEIR
WAY TO WIMBLEDON TRAVELLING BY ROAD AND THEY WERE SIMPLY CAMPING
AND NOT EXHIBITING AS THE PLACE IS SO SMALL A ONE THAT IT WOULD NOT
HAVE PAID THEM TO OPEN
THEY HAD AMONG THEIR EXHIBITS A VERY FINE NORTH AFRICAN LION SAHARA
KING WAS ITS NAME AND IT WAS THE HABIT BOTH OF RONDER AND HIS WIFE
TO GIVE EXHIBITIONS INSIDE ITS CAGE HERE YOU SEE IS A PHOTOGRAPH
OF THE PERFORMANCE BY WHICH YOU WILL PERCEIVE THAT RONDER WAS A HUGE
PORCINE PERSON AND THAT HIS WIFE WAS A VERY MAGNIFICENT WOMAN IT WAS
DEPOSED AT THE INQUEST THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME SIGNS THAT THE LION
WAS DANGEROUS BUT AS USUAL FAMILIARITY BEGAT CONTEMPT AND NO
NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THE FACT
IT WAS USUAL FOR EITHER RONDER OR HIS WIFE TO FEED THE LION AT
NIGHT SOMETIMES ONE WENT SOMETIMES BOTH BUT THEY NEVER ALLOWED
ANYONE ELSE TO DO IT FOR THEY BELIEVED THAT SO LONG AS THEY WERE THE
FOODCARRIERS HE WOULD REGARD THEM AS BENEFACTORS AND WOULD NEVER
MOLEST THEM ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT SEVEN YEARS AGO THEY BOTH
WENT AND A VERY TERRIBLE HAPPENING FOLLOWED THE DETAILS OF WHICH
HAVE NEVER BEEN MADE CLEAR
IT SEEMS THAT THE WHOLE CAMP WAS ROUSED NEAR MIDNIGHT BY THE ROARS
OF THE ANIMAL AND THE SCREAMS OF THE WOMAN THE DIFFERENT GROOMS AND
EMPLOYEES RUSHED FROM THEIR TENTS CARRYING LANTERNS AND BY THEIR
LIGHT AN AWFUL SIGHT WAS REVEALED RONDER LAY WITH THE BACK OF HIS
HEAD CRUSHED IN AND DEEP CLAWMARKS ACROSS HIS SCALP SOME TEN YARDS
FROM THE CAGE WHICH WAS OPEN CLOSE TO THE DOOR OF THE CAGE LAY MRS
RONDER UPON HER BACK WITH THE CREATURE SQUATTING AND SNARLING ABOVE
HER IT HAD TORN HER FACE IN SUCH A FASHION THAT IT WAS NEVER THOUGHT
THAT SHE COULD LIVE SEVERAL OF THE CIRCUS MEN HEADED BY LEONARDO
THE STRONG MAN AND GRIGGS THE CLOWN DROVE THE CREATURE OFF WITH
POLES UPON WHICH IT SPRANG BACK INTO THE CAGE AND WAS AT ONCE LOCKED
IN HOW IT HAD GOT LOOSE WAS A MYSTERY IT WAS CONJECTURED THAT THE
PAIR INTENDED TO ENTER THE CAGE BUT THAT WHEN THE DOOR WAS LOOSED
THE CREATURE BOUNDED OUT UPON THEM THERE WAS NO OTHER POINT OF
INTEREST IN THE EVIDENCE SAVE THAT THE WOMAN IN A DELIRIUM OF AGONY
KEPT SCREAMING COWARD COWARD AS SHE WAS CARRIED BACK TO THE VAN
IN WHICH THEY LIVED IT WAS SIX MONTHS BEFORE SHE WAS FIT TO GIVE
EVIDENCE BUT THE INQUEST WAS DULY HELD WITH THE OBVIOUS VERDICT OF
DEATH FROM MISADVENTURE
WHAT ALTERNATIVE COULD BE CONCEIVED SAID I
YOU MAY WELL SAY SO AND YET THERE WERE ONE OR TWO POINTS WHICH
WORRIED YOUNG EDMUNDS OF THE BERKSHIRE CONSTABULARY A SMART LAD
THAT HE WAS SENT LATER TO ALLAHABAD THAT WAS HOW I CAME INTO THE
MATTER FOR HE DROPPED IN AND SMOKED A PIPE OR TWO OVER IT
A THIN YELLOWHAIRED MAN
EXACTLY I WAS SURE YOU WOULD PICK UP THE TRAIL PRESENTLY
BUT WHAT WORRIED HIM
WELL WE WERE BOTH WORRIED IT WAS SO DEUCEDLY DIFFICULT TO
RECONSTRUCT THE AFFAIR LOOK AT IT FROM THE LIONS POINT OF VIEW HE
IS LIBERATED WHAT DOES HE DO HE TAKES HALF A DOZEN BOUNDS FORWARD
WHICH BRINGS HIM TO RONDER RONDER TURNS TO FLYTHE CLAWMARKS WERE
ON THE BACK OF HIS HEADBUT THE LION STRIKES HIM DOWN THEN INSTEAD
OF BOUNDING ON AND ESCAPING HE RETURNS TO THE WOMAN WHO WAS CLOSE
TO THE CAGE AND HE KNOCKS HER OVER AND CHEWS HER FACE UP THEN
AGAIN THOSE CRIES OF HERS WOULD SEEM TO IMPLY THAT HER HUSBAND HAD
IN SOME WAY FAILED HER WHAT COULD THE POOR DEVIL HAVE DONE TO HELP
HER YOU SEE THE DIFFICULTY
QUITE
AND THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER THING IT COMES BACK TO ME NOW AS I THINK
IT OVER THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE THAT JUST AT THE TIME THE LION
ROARED AND THE WOMAN SCREAMED A MAN BEGAN SHOUTING IN TERROR
THIS MAN RONDER NO DOUBT
WELL IF HIS SKULL WAS SMASHED IN YOU WOULD HARDLY EXPECT TO HEAR
FROM HIM AGAIN THERE WERE AT LEAST TWO WITNESSES WHO SPOKE OF THE
CRIES OF A MAN BEING MINGLED WITH THOSE OF A WOMAN
I SHOULD THINK THE WHOLE CAMP WAS CRYING OUT BY THEN AS TO THE
OTHER POINTS I THINK I COULD SUGGEST A SOLUTION
I SHOULD BE GLAD TO CONSIDER IT
THE TWO WERE TOGETHER TEN YARDS FROM THE CAGE WHEN THE LION GOT
LOOSE THE MAN TURNED AND WAS STRUCK DOWN THE WOMAN CONCEIVED THE
IDEA OF GETTING INTO THE CAGE AND SHUTTING THE DOOR IT WAS HER ONLY
REFUGE SHE MADE FOR IT AND JUST AS SHE REACHED IT THE BEAST BOUNDED
AFTER HER AND KNOCKED HER OVER SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HER HUSBAND FOR
HAVING ENCOURAGED THE BEASTS RAGE BY TURNING IF THEY HAD FACED IT
THEY MIGHT HAVE COWED IT HENCE HER CRIES OF COWARD
BRILLIANT WATSON ONLY ONE FLAW IN YOUR DIAMOND
WHAT IS THE FLAW HOLMES
IF THEY WERE BOTH TEN PACES FROM THE CAGE HOW CAME THE BEAST TO GET
LOOSE
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY HAD SOME ENEMY WHO LOOSED IT
AND WHY SHOULD IT ATTACK THEM SAVAGELY WHEN IT WAS IN THE HABIT OF
PLAYING WITH THEM AND DOING TRICKS WITH THEM INSIDE THE CAGE
POSSIBLY THE SAME ENEMY HAD DONE SOMETHING TO ENRAGE IT
HOLMES LOOKED THOUGHTFUL AND REMAINED IN SILENCE FOR SOME MOMENTS
WELL WATSON THERE IS THIS TO BE SAID FOR YOUR THEORY RONDER WAS A
MAN OF MANY ENEMIES EDMUNDS TOLD ME THAT IN HIS CUPS HE WAS
HORRIBLE A HUGE BULLY OF A MAN HE CURSED AND SLASHED AT EVERYONE
WHO CAME IN HIS WAY I EXPECT THOSE CRIES ABOUT A MONSTER OF WHICH
OUR VISITOR HAS SPOKEN WERE NOCTURNAL REMINISCENCES OF THE DEAR
DEPARTED HOWEVER OUR SPECULATIONS ARE FUTILE UNTIL WE HAVE ALL THE
FACTS THERE IS A COLD PARTRIDGE ON THE SIDEBOARD WATSON AND A
BOTTLE OF MONTRACHET LET US RENEW OUR ENERGIES BEFORE WE MAKE A
FRESH CALL UPON THEM
WHEN OUR HANSOM DEPOSITED US AT THE HOUSE OF MRS MERRILOW WE FOUND
THAT PLUMP LADY BLOCKING UP THE OPEN DOOR OF HER HUMBLE BUT RETIRED
ABODE IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT HER CHIEF PREOCCUPATION WAS LEST SHE
SHOULD LOSE A VALUABLE LODGER AND SHE IMPLORED US BEFORE SHOWING US
UP TO SAY AND DO NOTHING WHICH COULD LEAD TO SO UNDESIRABLE AN END
THEN HAVING REASSURED HER WE FOLLOWED HER UP THE STRAIGHT BADLY
CARPETED STAIRCASE AND WERE SHOWN INTO THE ROOM OF THE MYSTERIOUS
LODGER
IT WAS A CLOSE MUSTY ILLVENTILATED PLACE AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED
SINCE ITS INMATE SELDOM LEFT IT FROM KEEPING BEASTS IN A CAGE THE
WOMAN SEEMED BY SOME RETRIBUTION OF FATE TO HAVE BECOME HERSELF A
BEAST IN A CAGE SHE SAT NOW IN A BROKEN ARMCHAIR IN THE SHADOWY
CORNER OF THE ROOM LONG YEARS OF INACTION HAD COARSENED THE LINES OF
HER FIGURE BUT AT SOME PERIOD IT MUST HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL AND WAS
STILL FULL AND VOLUPTUOUS A THICK DARK VEIL COVERED HER FACE BUT IT
WAS CUT OFF CLOSE AT HER UPPER LIP AND DISCLOSED A PERFECTLY SHAPED
MOUTH AND A DELICATELY ROUNDED CHIN I COULD WELL CONCEIVE THAT SHE
HAD INDEED BEEN A VERY REMARKABLE WOMAN HER VOICE TOO WAS WELL
MODULATED AND PLEASING
MY NAME IS NOT UNFAMILIAR TO YOU MR HOLMES SAID SHE I THOUGHT
THAT IT WOULD BRING YOU
THAT IS SO MADAM THOUGH I DO NOT KNOW HOW YOU ARE AWARE THAT I WAS
INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE
I LEARNED IT WHEN I HAD RECOVERED MY HEALTH AND WAS EXAMINED BY MR
EDMUNDS THE COUNTY DETECTIVE I FEAR I LIED TO HIM PERHAPS IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN WISER HAD I TOLD THE TRUTH
IT IS USUALLY WISER TO TELL THE TRUTH BUT WHY DID YOU LIE TO HIM
BECAUSE THE FATE OF SOMEONE ELSE DEPENDED UPON IT I KNOW THAT HE
WAS A VERY WORTHLESS BEING AND YET I WOULD NOT HAVE HIS DESTRUCTION
UPON MY CONSCIENCE WE HAD BEEN SO CLOSESO CLOSE
BUT HAS THIS IMPEDIMENT BEEN REMOVED
YES SIR THE PERSON THAT I ALLUDE TO IS DEAD
THEN WHY SHOULD YOU NOT NOW TELL THE POLICE ANYTHING YOU KNOW
BECAUSE THERE IS ANOTHER PERSON TO BE CONSIDERED THAT OTHER PERSON
IS MYSELF I COULD NOT STAND THE SCANDAL AND PUBLICITY WHICH WOULD
COME FROM A POLICE EXAMINATION I HAVE NOT LONG TO LIVE BUT I WISH
TO DIE UNDISTURBED AND YET I WANTED TO FIND ONE MAN OF JUDGMENT TO
WHOM I COULD TELL MY TERRIBLE STORY SO THAT WHEN I AM GONE ALL MIGHT
BE UNDERSTOOD
YOU COMPLIMENT ME MADAM AT THE SAME TIME I AM A RESPONSIBLE
PERSON I DO NOT PROMISE YOU THAT WHEN YOU HAVE SPOKEN I MAY NOT
MYSELF THINK IT MY DUTY TO REFER THE CASE TO THE POLICE
I THINK NOT MR HOLMES I KNOW YOUR CHARACTER AND METHODS TOO WELL
FOR I HAVE FOLLOWED YOUR WORK FOR SOME YEARS READING IS THE ONLY
PLEASURE WHICH FATE HAS LEFT ME AND I MISS LITTLE WHICH PASSES IN
THE WORLD BUT IN ANY CASE I WILL TAKE MY CHANCE OF THE USE WHICH
YOU MAY MAKE OF MY TRAGEDY IT WILL EASE MY MIND TO TELL IT
MY FRIEND AND I WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR IT
THE WOMAN ROSE AND TOOK FROM A DRAWER THE PHOTOGRAPH OF A MAN HE WAS
CLEARLY A PROFESSIONAL ACROBAT A MAN OF MAGNIFICENT PHYSIQUE TAKEN
WITH HIS HUGE ARMS FOLDED ACROSS HIS SWOLLEN CHEST AND A SMILE
BREAKING FROM UNDER HIS HEAVY MOUSTACHETHE SELFSATISFIED SMILE OF
THE MAN OF MANY CONQUESTS
THAT IS LEONARDO SHE SAID
LEONARDO THE STRONG MAN WHO GAVE EVIDENCE
THE SAME AND THISTHIS IS MY HUSBAND
IT WAS A DREADFUL FACEA HUMAN PIG OR RATHER A HUMAN WILD BOAR FOR
IT WAS FORMIDABLE IN ITS BESTIALITY ONE COULD IMAGINE THAT VILE
MOUTH CHAMPING AND FOAMING IN ITS RAGE AND ONE COULD CONCEIVE THOSE
SMALL VICIOUS EYES DARTING PURE MALIGNANCY AS THEY LOOKED FORTH UPON
THE WORLD RUFFIAN BULLY BEASTIT WAS ALL WRITTEN ON THAT
HEAVYJOWLED FACE
THOSE TWO PICTURES WILL HELP YOU GENTLEMEN TO UNDERSTAND THE
STORY I WAS A POOR CIRCUS GIRL BROUGHT UP ON THE SAWDUST AND DOING
SPRINGS THROUGH THE HOOP BEFORE I WAS TEN WHEN I BECAME A WOMAN THIS
MAN LOVED ME IF SUCH LUST AS HIS CAN BE CALLED LOVE AND IN AN EVIL
MOMENT I BECAME HIS WIFE FROM THAT DAY I WAS IN HELL AND HE THE
DEVIL WHO TORMENTED ME THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE SHOW WHO DID NOT KNOW
OF HIS TREATMENT HE DESERTED ME FOR OTHERS HE TIED ME DOWN AND
LASHED ME WITH HIS RIDINGWHIP WHEN I COMPLAINED THEY ALL PITIED ME
AND THEY ALL LOATHED HIM BUT WHAT COULD THEY DO THEY FEARED HIM
ONE AND ALL FOR HE WAS TERRIBLE AT ALL TIMES AND MURDEROUS WHEN HE
WAS DRUNK AGAIN AND AGAIN HE WAS HAD UP FOR ASSAULT AND FOR CRUELTY
TO THE BEASTS BUT HE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY AND THE FINES WERE NOTHING
TO HIM THE BEST MEN ALL LEFT US AND THE SHOW BEGAN TO GO DOWNHILL
IT WAS ONLY LEONARDO AND I WHO KEPT IT UPWITH LITTLE JIMMY GRIGGS
THE CLOWN POOR DEVIL HE HAD NOT MUCH TO BE FUNNY ABOUT BUT HE DID
WHAT HE COULD TO HOLD THINGS TOGETHER
THEN LEONARDO CAME MORE AND MORE INTO MY LIFE YOU SEE WHAT HE WAS
LIKE I KNOW NOW THE POOR SPIRIT THAT WAS HIDDEN IN THAT SPLENDID
BODY BUT COMPARED TO MY HUSBAND HE SEEMED LIKE THE ANGEL GABRIEL HE
PITIED ME AND HELPED ME TILL AT LAST OUR INTIMACY TURNED TO
LOVEDEEP DEEP PASSIONATE LOVE SUCH LOVE AS I HAD DREAMED OF BUT
NEVER HOPED TO FEEL MY HUSBAND SUSPECTED IT BUT I THINK THAT HE WAS
A COWARD AS WELL AS A BULLY AND THAT LEONARDO WAS THE ONE MAN THAT
HE WAS AFRAID OF HE TOOK REVENGE IN HIS OWN WAY BY TORTURING ME MORE
THAN EVER ONE NIGHT MY CRIES BROUGHT LEONARDO TO THE DOOR OF OUR
VAN WE WERE NEAR TRAGEDY THAT NIGHT AND SOON MY LOVER AND I
UNDERSTOOD THAT IT COULD NOT BE AVOIDED MY HUSBAND WAS NOT FIT TO
LIVE WE PLANNED THAT HE SHOULD DIE
LEONARDO HAD A CLEVER SCHEMING BRAIN IT WAS HE WHO PLANNED IT I
DO NOT SAY THAT TO BLAME HIM FOR I WAS READY TO GO WITH HIM EVERY
INCH OF THE WAY BUT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD THE WIT TO THINK OF SUCH
A PLAN WE MADE A CLUBLEONARDO MADE ITAND IN THE LEADEN HEAD HE
FASTENED FIVE LONG STEEL NAILS THE POINTS OUTWARD WITH JUST SUCH A
SPREAD AS THE LIONS PAW THIS WAS TO GIVE MY HUSBAND HIS DEATHBLOW
AND YET TO LEAVE THE EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS THE LION WHICH WE WOULD
LOOSE WHO HAD DONE THE DEED
IT WAS A PITCHDARK NIGHT WHEN MY HUSBAND AND I WENT DOWN AS WAS
OUR CUSTOM TO FEED THE BEAST WE CARRIED WITH US THE RAW MEAT IN A
ZINC PAIL LEONARDO WAS WAITING AT THE CORNER OF THE BIG VAN WHICH WE
SHOULD HAVE TO PASS BEFORE WE REACHED THE CAGE HE WAS TOO SLOW AND
WE WALKED PAST HIM BEFORE HE COULD STRIKE BUT HE FOLLOWED US ON
TIPTOE AND I HEARD THE CRASH AS THE CLUB SMASHED MY HUSBANDS SKULL
MY HEART LEAPED WITH JOY AT THE SOUND I SPRANG FORWARD AND I UNDID
THE CATCH WHICH HELD THE DOOR OF THE GREAT LIONS CAGE
AND THEN THE TERRIBLE THING HAPPENED YOU MAY HAVE HEARD HOW QUICK
THESE CREATURES ARE TO SCENT HUMAN BLOOD AND HOW IT EXCITES THEM
SOME STRANGE INSTINCT HAD TOLD THE CREATURE IN ONE INSTANT THAT A
HUMAN BEING HAD BEEN SLAIN AS I SLIPPED THE BARS IT BOUNDED OUT AND
WAS ON ME IN AN INSTANT LEONARDO COULD HAVE SAVED ME IF HE HAD
RUSHED FORWARD AND STRUCK THE BEAST WITH HIS CLUB HE MIGHT HAVE COWED
IT BUT THE MAN LOST HIS NERVE I HEARD HIM SHOUT IN HIS TERROR AND
THEN I SAW HIM TURN AND FLY AT THE SAME INSTANT THE TEETH OF THE
LION MET IN MY FACE ITS HOT FILTHY BREATH HAD ALREADY POISONED ME
AND I WAS HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF PAIN WITH THE PALMS OF MY HANDS I
TRIED TO PUSH THE GREAT STEAMING BLOODSTAINED JAWS AWAY FROM ME
AND I SCREAMED FOR HELP I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THE CAMP WAS STIRRING
AND THEN DIMLY I REMEMBERED A GROUP OF MEN LEONARDO GRIGGS AND
OTHERS DRAGGING ME FROM UNDER THE CREATURES PAWS THAT WAS MY LAST
MEMORY MR HOLMES FOR MANY A WEARY MONTH WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF AND
SAW MYSELF IN THE MIRROR I CURSED THAT LIONOH HOW I CURSED
HIMNOT BECAUSE HE HAD TORN AWAY MY BEAUTY BUT BECAUSE HE HAD NOT
TORN AWAY MY LIFE I HAD BUT ONE DESIRE MR HOLMES AND I HAD ENOUGH
MONEY TO GRATIFY IT IT WAS THAT I SHOULD COVER MYSELF SO THAT MY
POOR FACE SHOULD BE SEEN BY NONE AND THAT I SHOULD DWELL WHERE NONE
WHOM I HAD EVER KNOWN SHOULD FIND ME THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS LEFT TO
ME TO DOAND THAT IS WHAT I HAVE DONE A POOR WOUNDED BEAST THAT HAS
CRAWLED INTO ITS HOLE TO DIETHAT IS THE END OF EUGENIA RONDER
WE SAT IN SILENCE FOR SOME TIME AFTER THE UNHAPPY WOMAN HAD TOLD HER
STORY THEN HOLMES STRETCHED OUT HIS LONG ARM AND PATTED HER HAND
WITH SUCH A SHOW OF SYMPATHY AS I HAD SELDOM KNOWN HIM TO EXHIBIT
POOR GIRL HE SAID POOR GIRL THE WAYS OF FATE ARE INDEED HARD TO
UNDERSTAND IF THERE IS NOT SOME COMPENSATION HEREAFTER THEN THE
WORLD IS A CRUEL JEST BUT WHAT OF THIS MAN LEONARDO
I NEVER SAW HIM OR HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN WRONG
TO FEEL SO BITTERLY AGAINST HIM HE MIGHT AS SOON HAVE LOVED ONE OF
THE FREAKS WHOM WE CARRIED ROUND THE COUNTRY AS THE THING WHICH THE
LION HAD LEFT BUT A WOMANS LOVE IS NOT SO EASILY SET ASIDE HE HAD
LEFT ME UNDER THE BEASTS CLAWS HE HAD DESERTED ME IN MY NEED AND
YET I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO GIVE HIM TO THE GALLOWS FOR MYSELF
I CARED NOTHING WHAT BECAME OF ME WHAT COULD BE MORE DREADFUL THAN
MY ACTUAL LIFE BUT I STOOD BETWEEN LEONARDO AND HIS FATE
AND HE IS DEAD
HE WAS DROWNED LAST MONTH WHEN BATHING NEAR MARGATE I SAW HIS DEATH
IN THE PAPER
AND WHAT DID HE DO WITH THIS FIVECLAWED CLUB WHICH IS THE MOST
SINGULAR AND INGENIOUS PART OF ALL YOUR STORY
I CANNOT TELL MR HOLMES THERE IS A CHALKPIT BY THE CAMP WITH A
DEEP GREEN POOL AT THE BASE OF IT PERHAPS IN THE DEPTHS OF THAT
POOL
WELL WELL IT IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE NOW THE CASE IS CLOSED
YES SAID THE WOMAN THE CASE IS CLOSED
WE HAD RISEN TO GO BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE WOMANS VOICE
WHICH ARRESTED HOLMESS ATTENTION HE TURNED SWIFTLY UPON HER
YOUR LIFE IS NOT YOUR OWN HE SAID KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF IT
WHAT USE IS IT TO ANYONE
HOW CAN YOU TELL THE EXAMPLE OF PATIENT SUFFERING IS IN ITSELF THE
MOST PRECIOUS OF ALL LESSONS TO AN IMPATIENT WORLD
THE WOMANS ANSWER WAS A TERRIBLE ONE SHE RAISED HER VEIL AND
STEPPED FORWARD INTO THE LIGHT
I WONDER IF YOU WOULD BEAR IT SHE SAID
IT WAS HORRIBLE NO WORDS CAN DESCRIBE THE FRAMEWORK OF A FACE WHEN
THE FACE ITSELF IS GONE TWO LIVING AND BEAUTIFUL BROWN EYES LOOKING
SADLY OUT FROM THAT GRISLY RUIN DID BUT MAKE THE VIEW MORE AWFUL
HOLMES HELD UP HIS HAND IN A GESTURE OF PITY AND PROTEST AND
TOGETHER WE LEFT THE ROOM
TWO DAYS LATER WHEN I CALLED UPON MY FRIEND HE POINTED WITH SOME
PRIDE TO A SMALL BLUE BOTTLE UPON HIS MANTELPIECE I PICKED IT UP
THERE WAS A RED POISON LABEL A PLEASANT ALMONDY ODOUR ROSE WHEN I
OPENED IT
PRUSSIC ACID SAID I
EXACTLY IT CAME BY POST I SEND YOU MY TEMPTATION I WILL FOLLOW
YOUR ADVICE THAT WAS THE MESSAGE I THINK WATSON WE CAN GUESS THE
NAME OF THE BRAVE WOMAN WHO SENT IT
THE ADVENTURE OF SHOSCOMBE OLD PLACE
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD BEEN BENDING FOR A LONG TIME OVER A LOWPOWER
MICROSCOPE NOW HE STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AND LOOKED ROUND AT ME IN
TRIUMPH
IT IS GLUE WATSON SAID HE UNQUESTIONABLY IT IS GLUE HAVE A
LOOK AT THESE SCATTERED OBJECTS IN THE FIELD
I STOOPED TO THE EYEPIECE AND FOCUSSED FOR MY VISION
THOSE HAIRS ARE THREADS FROM A TWEED COAT THE IRREGULAR GRAY MASSES
ARE DUST THERE ARE EPITHELIAL SCALES ON THE LEFT THOSE BROWN BLOBS
IN THE CENTRE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY GLUE
WELL I SAID LAUGHING I AM PREPARED TO TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT
DOES ANYTHING DEPEND UPON IT
IT IS A VERY FINE DEMONSTRATION HE ANSWERED IN THE ST PANCRAS
CASE YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT A CAP WAS FOUND BESIDE THE DEAD POLICEMAN
THE ACCUSED MAN DENIES THAT IT IS HIS BUT HE IS A PICTUREFRAME
MAKER WHO HABITUALLY HANDLES GLUE
IS IT ONE OF YOUR CASES
NO MY FRIEND MERIVALE OF THE YARD ASKED ME TO LOOK INTO THE
CASE SINCE I RAN DOWN THAT COINER BY THE ZINC AND COPPER FILINGS IN
THE SEAM OF HIS CUFF THEY HAVE BEGUN TO REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE
MICROSCOPE HE LOOKED IMPATIENTLY AT HIS WATCH I HAD A NEW CLIENT
CALLING BUT HE IS OVERDUE BY THE WAY WATSON YOU KNOW SOMETHING OF
RACING
I OUGHT TO I PAY FOR IT WITH ABOUT HALF MY WOUND PENSION
THEN ILL MAKE YOU MY HANDY GUIDE TO THE TURF WHAT ABOUT SIR
ROBERT NORBERTON DOES THE NAME RECALL ANYTHING
WELL I SHOULD SAY SO HE LIVES AT SHOSCOMBE OLD PLACE AND I KNOW
IT WELL FOR MY SUMMER QUARTERS WERE DOWN THERE ONCE NORBERTON
NEARLY CAME WITHIN YOUR PROVINCE ONCE
HOW WAS THAT
IT WAS WHEN HE HORSEWHIPPED SAM BREWER THE WELLKNOWN CURZON STREET
MONEYLENDER ON NEWMARKET HEATH HE NEARLY KILLED THE MAN
AH HE SOUNDS INTERESTING DOES HE OFTEN INDULGE IN THAT WAY
WELL HE HAS THE NAME OF BEING A DANGEROUS MAN HE IS ABOUT THE MOST
DAREDEVIL RIDER IN ENGLANDSECOND IN THE GRAND NATIONAL A FEW YEARS
BACK HE IS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO HAVE OVERSHOT THEIR TRUE GENERATION
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BUCK IN THE DAYS OF THE REGENCYA BOXER AN
ATHLETE A PLUNGER ON THE TURF A LOVER OF FAIR LADIES AND BY ALL
ACCOUNT SO FAR DOWN QUEER STREET THAT HE MAY NEVER FIND HIS WAY BACK
AGAIN
CAPITAL WATSON A THUMBNAIL SKETCH I SEEM TO KNOW THE MAN NOW
CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME IDEA OF SHOSCOMBE OLD PLACE
ONLY THAT IT IS IN THE CENTRE OF SHOSCOMBE PARK AND THAT THE FAMOUS
SHOSCOMBE STUD AND TRAINING QUARTERS ARE TO BE FOUND THERE
AND THE HEAD TRAINER SAID HOLMES IS JOHN MASON YOU NEED NOT
LOOK SURPRISED AT MY KNOWLEDGE WATSON FOR THIS IS A LETTER FROM HIM
WHICH I AM UNFOLDING BUT LET US HAVE SOME MORE ABOUT SHOSCOMBE I
SEEM TO HAVE STRUCK A RICH VEIN
THERE ARE THE SHOSCOMBE SPANIELS SAID I YOU HEAR OF THEM AT
EVERY DOG SHOW THE MOST EXCLUSIVE BREED IN ENGLAND THEY ARE THE
SPECIAL PRIDE OF THE LADY OF SHOSCOMBE OLD PLACE
SIR ROBERT NORBERTONS WIFE I PRESUME
SIR ROBERT HAS NEVER MARRIED JUST AS WELL I THINK CONSIDERING HIS
PROSPECTS HE LIVES WITH HIS WIDOWED SISTER LADY BEATRICE FALDER
YOU MEAN THAT SHE LIVES WITH HIM
NO NO THE PLACE BELONGED TO HER LATE HUSBAND SIR JAMES NORBERTON
HAS NO CLAIM ON IT AT ALL IT IS ONLY A LIFE INTEREST AND REVERTS TO
HER HUSBANDS BROTHER MEANTIME SHE DRAWS THE RENTS EVERY YEAR
AND BROTHER ROBERT I SUPPOSE SPENDS THE SAID RENTS
THAT IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT HE IS A DEVIL OF A FELLOW AND MUST
LEAD HER A MOST UNEASY LIFE YET I HAVE HEARD THAT SHE IS DEVOTED TO
HIM BUT WHAT IS AMISS AT SHOSCOMBE
AH THAT IS JUST WHAT I WANT TO KNOW AND HERE I EXPECT IS THE MAN
WHO CAN TELL US
THE DOOR HAD OPENED AND THE PAGE HAD SHOWN IN A TALL CLEANSHAVEN
MAN WITH THE FIRM AUSTERE EXPRESSION WHICH IS ONLY SEEN UPON THOSE
WHO HAVE TO CONTROL HORSES OR BOYS MR JOHN MASON HAD MANY OF BOTH
UNDER HIS SWAY AND HE LOOKED EQUAL TO THE TASK HE BOWED WITH COLD
SELFPOSSESSION AND SEATED HIMSELF UPON THE CHAIR TO WHICH HOLMES HAD
WAVED HIM
YOU HAD MY NOTE MR HOLMES
YES BUT IT EXPLAINED NOTHING
IT WAS TOO DELICATE A THING FOR ME TO PUT THE DETAILS ON PAPER AND
TOO COMPLICATED IT WAS ONLY FACE TO FACE I COULD DO IT
WELL WE ARE AT YOUR DISPOSAL
FIRST OF ALL MR HOLMES I THINK THAT MY EMPLOYER SIR ROBERT HAS
GONE MAD
HOLMES RAISED HIS EYEBROWS THIS IS BAKER STREET NOT HARLEY
STREET SAID HE BUT WHY DO YOU SAY SO
WELL SIR WHEN A MAN DOES ONE QUEER THING OR TWO QUEER THINGS
THERE MAY BE A MEANING TO IT BUT WHEN EVERYTHING HE DOES IS QUEER
THEN YOU BEGIN TO WONDER I BELIEVE SHOSCOMBE PRINCE AND THE DERBY
HAVE TURNED HIS BRAIN
THAT IS A COLT YOU ARE RUNNING
THE BEST IN ENGLAND MR HOLMES I SHOULD KNOW IF ANYONE DOES NOW
ILL BE PLAIN WITH YOU FOR I KNOW YOU ARE GENTLEMEN OF HONOUR AND
THAT IT WONT GO BEYOND THE ROOM SIR ROBERT HAS GOT TO WIN THIS
DERBY HES UP TO THE NECK AND ITS HIS LAST CHANCE EVERYTHING HE
COULD RAISE OR BORROW IS ON THE HORSEAND AT FINE ODDS TOO YOU CAN
GET FORTIES NOW BUT IT WAS NEARER THE HUNDRED WHEN HE BEGAN TO BACK
HIM
BUT HOW IS THAT IF THE HORSE IS SO GOOD
THE PUBLIC DONT KNOW HOW GOOD HE IS SIR ROBERT HAS BEEN TOO CLEVER
FOR THE TOUTS HE HAS THE PRINCES HALFBROTHER OUT FOR SPINS YOU
CANT TELL EM APART BUT THERE ARE TWO LENGTHS IN A FURLONG BETWEEN
THEM WHEN IT COMES TO A GALLOP HE THINKS OF NOTHING BUT THE HORSE
AND THE RACE HIS WHOLE LIFE IS ON IT HES HOLDING OFF THE JEWS TILL
THEN IF THE PRINCE FAILS HIM HE IS DONE
IT SEEMS A RATHER DESPERATE GAMBLE BUT WHERE DOES THE MADNESS COME
IN
WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE ONLY TO LOOK AT HIM I DONT BELIEVE HE
SLEEPS AT NIGHT HE IS DOWN AT THE STABLES AT ALL HOURS HIS EYES ARE
WILD IT HAS ALL BEEN TOO MUCH FOR HIS NERVES THEN THERE IS HIS
CONDUCT TO LADY BEATRICE
AH WHAT IS THAT
THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE BEST OF FRIENDS THEY HAD THE SAME TASTES
THE TWO OF THEM AND SHE LOVED THE HORSES AS MUCH AS HE DID EVERY
DAY AT THE SAME HOUR SHE WOULD DRIVE DOWN TO SEE THEMAND ABOVE
ALL SHE LOVED THE PRINCE HE WOULD PRICK UP HIS EARS WHEN HE HEARD
THE WHEELS ON THE GRAVEL AND HE WOULD TROT OUT EACH MORNING TO THE
CARRIAGE TO GET HIS LUMP OF SUGAR BUT THATS ALL OVER NOW
WHY
WELL SHE SEEMS TO HAVE LOST ALL INTEREST IN THE HORSES FOR A WEEK
NOW SHE HAS DRIVEN PAST THE STABLES WITH NEVER SO MUCH AS
GOODMORNING
YOU THINK THERE HAS BEEN A QUARREL
AND A BITTER SAVAGE SPITEFUL QUARREL AT THAT WHY ELSE WOULD HE
GIVE AWAY HER PET SPANIEL THAT SHE LOVED AS IF HE WERE HER CHILD HE
GAVE IT A FEW DAYS AGO TO OLD BARNES WHAT KEEPS THE GREEN DRAGON
THREE MILES OFF AT CRENDALL
THAT CERTAINLY DID SEEM STRANGE
OF COURSE WITH HER WEAK HEART AND DROPSY ONE COULDNT EXPECT THAT
SHE COULD GET ABOUT WITH HIM BUT HE SPENT TWO HOURS EVERY EVENING IN
HER ROOM HE MIGHT WELL DO WHAT HE COULD FOR SHE HAS BEEN A RARE
GOOD FRIEND TO HIM BUT THATS ALL OVER TOO HE NEVER GOES NEAR HER
AND SHE TAKES IT TO HEART SHE IS BROODING AND SULKY AND DRINKING
MR HOLMESDRINKING LIKE A FISH
DID SHE DRINK BEFORE THIS ESTRANGEMENT
WELL SHE TOOK HER GLASS BUT NOW IT IS OFTEN A WHOLE BOTTLE OF AN
EVENING SO STEPHENS THE BUTLER TOLD ME ITS ALL CHANGED MR
HOLMES AND THERE IS SOMETHING DAMNED ROTTEN ABOUT IT BUT THEN
AGAIN WHAT IS MASTER DOING DOWN AT THE OLD CHURCH CRYPT AT NIGHT
AND WHO IS THE MAN THAT MEETS HIM THERE
HOLMES RUBBED HIS HANDS
GO ON MR MASON YOU GET MORE AND MORE INTERESTING
IT WAS THE BUTLER WHO SAW HIM GO TWELVE OCLOCK AT NIGHT AND
RAINING HARD SO NEXT NIGHT I WAS UP AT THE HOUSE AND SURE ENOUGH
MASTER WAS OFF AGAIN STEPHENS AND I WENT AFTER HIM BUT IT WAS JUMPY
WORK FOR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BAD JOB IF HE HAD SEEN US HES A
TERRIBLE MAN WITH HIS FISTS IF HE GETS STARTED AND NO RESPECTER OF
PERSONS SO WE WERE SHY OF GETTING TOO NEAR BUT WE MARKED HIM DOWN
ALL RIGHT IT WAS THE HAUNTED CRYPT THAT HE WAS MAKING FOR AND THERE
WAS A MAN WAITING FOR HIM THERE
WHAT IS THIS HAUNTED CRYPT
WELL SIR THERE IS AN OLD RUINED CHAPEL IN THE PARK IT IS SO OLD
THAT NOBODY COULD FIX ITS DATE AND UNDER IT THERES A CRYPT WHICH
HAS A BAD NAME AMONG US ITS A DARK DAMP LONELY PLACE BY DAY BUT
THERE ARE FEW IN THAT COUNTY THAT WOULD HAVE THE NERVE TO GO NEAR IT
AT NIGHT BUT MASTERS NOT AFRAID HE NEVER FEARED ANYTHING IN HIS
LIFE BUT WHAT IS HE DOING THERE IN THE NIGHTTIME
WAIT A BIT SAID HOLMES YOU SAY THERE IS ANOTHER MAN THERE IT
MUST BE ONE OF YOUR OWN STABLEMEN OR SOMEONE FROM THE HOUSE SURELY
YOU HAVE ONLY TO SPOT WHO IT IS AND QUESTION HIM
ITS NO ONE I KNOW
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT
BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN HIM MR HOLMES IT WAS ON THAT SECOND NIGHT
SIR ROBERT TURNED AND PASSED USME AND STEPHENS QUAKING IN THE
BUSHES LIKE TWO BUNNYRABBITS FOR THERE WAS A BIT OF MOON THAT
NIGHT BUT WE COULD HEAR THE OTHER MOVING ABOUT BEHIND WE WERE NOT
AFRAID OF HIM SO WE UP WHEN SIR ROBERT WAS GONE AND PRETENDED WE
WERE JUST HAVING A WALK LIKE IN THE MOONLIGHT AND SO WE CAME RIGHT
ON HIM AS CASUAL AND INNOCENT AS YOU PLEASE HULLO MATE WHO MAY
YOU BE SAYS I I GUESS HE HAD NOT HEARD US COMING SO HE LOOKED
OVER HIS SHOULDER WITH A FACE AS IF HE HAD SEEN THE DEVIL COMING OUT
OF HELL HE LET OUT A YELL AND AWAY HE WENT AS HARD AS HE COULD LICK
IT IN THE DARKNESS HE COULD RUNILL GIVE HIM THAT IN A MINUTE HE
WAS OUT OF SIGHT AND HEARING AND WHO HE WAS OR WHAT HE WAS WE
NEVER FOUND
BUT YOU SAW HIM CLEARLY IN THE MOONLIGHT
YES I WOULD SWEAR TO HIS YELLOW FACEA MEAN DOG I SHOULD SAY
WHAT COULD HE HAVE IN COMMON WITH SIR ROBERT
HOLMES SAT FOR SOME TIME LOST IN THOUGHT
WHO KEEPS LADY BEATRICE FALDER COMPANY HE ASKED AT LAST
THERE IS HER MAID CARRIE EVANS SHE HAS BEEN WITH HER THIS FIVE
YEARS
AND IS NO DOUBT DEVOTED
MR MASON SHUFFLED UNCOMFORTABLY
SHES DEVOTED ENOUGH HE ANSWERED AT LAST BUT I WONT SAY TO
WHOM
AH SAID HOLMES
I CANT TELL TALES OUT OF SCHOOL
I QUITE UNDERSTAND MR MASON OF COURSE THE SITUATION IS CLEAR
ENOUGH FROM DR WATSONS DESCRIPTION OF SIR ROBERT I CAN REALIZE
THAT NO WOMAN IS SAFE FROM HIM DONT YOU THINK THE QUARREL BETWEEN
BROTHER AND SISTER MAY LIE THERE
WELL THE SCANDAL HAS BEEN PRETTY CLEAR FOR A LONG TIME
BUT SHE MAY NOT HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE LET US SUPPOSE THAT SHE HAS
SUDDENLY FOUND IT OUT SHE WANTS TO GET RID OF THE WOMAN HER BROTHER
WILL NOT PERMIT IT THE INVALID WITH HER WEAK HEART AND INABILITY TO
GET ABOUT HAS NO MEANS OF ENFORCING HER WILL THE HATED MAID IS
STILL TIED TO HER THE LADY REFUSES TO SPEAK SULKS TAKES TO DRINK
SIR ROBERT IN HIS ANGER TAKES HER PET SPANIEL AWAY FROM HER DOES NOT
ALL THIS HANG TOGETHER
WELL IT MIGHT DOSO FAR AS IT GOES
EXACTLY AS FAR AS IT GOES HOW WOULD ALL THAT BEAR UPON THE VISITS
BY NIGHT TO THE OLD CRYPT WE CANT FIT THAT INTO OUR PLOT
NO SIR AND THERE IS SOMETHING MORE THAT I CANT FIT IN WHY SHOULD
SIR ROBERT WANT TO DIG UP A DEAD BODY
HOLMES SAT UP ABRUPTLY
WE ONLY FOUND IT OUT YESTERDAYAFTER I HAD WRITTEN TO YOU
YESTERDAY SIR ROBERT HAD GONE TO LONDON SO STEPHENS AND I WENT DOWN
TO THE CRYPT IT WAS ALL IN ORDER SIR EXCEPT THAT IN ONE CORNER WAS
A BIT OF A HUMAN BODY
YOU INFORMED THE POLICE I SUPPOSE
OUR VISITOR SMILED GRIMLY
WELL SIR I THINK IT WOULD HARDLY INTEREST THEM IT WAS JUST THE
HEAD AND A FEW BONES OF A MUMMY IT MAY HAVE BEEN A THOUSAND YEARS
OLD BUT IT WASNT THERE BEFORE THAT ILL SWEAR AND SO WILL
STEPHENS IT HAD BEEN STOWED AWAY IN A CORNER AND COVERED OVER WITH A
BOARD BUT THAT CORNER HAD ALWAYS BEEN EMPTY BEFORE
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT
WELL WE JUST LEFT IT THERE
THAT WAS WISE YOU SAY SIR ROBERT WAS AWAY YESTERDAY HAS HE
RETURNED
WE EXPECT HIM BACK TODAY
WHEN DID SIR ROBERT GIVE AWAY HIS SISTERS DOG
IT WAS JUST A WEEK AGO TODAY THE CREATURE WAS HOWLING OUTSIDE THE
OLD WELLHOUSE AND SIR ROBERT WAS IN ONE OF HIS TANTRUMS THAT
MORNING HE CAUGHT IT UP AND I THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE KILLED IT THEN
HE GAVE IT TO SANDY BAIN THE JOCKEY AND TOLD HIM TO TAKE THE DOG TO
OLD BARNES AT THE GREEN DRAGON FOR HE NEVER WISHED TO SEE IT AGAIN
HOLMES SAT FOR SOME TIME IN SILENT THOUGHT HE HAD LIT THE OLDEST AND
FOULEST OF HIS PIPES
I AM NOT CLEAR YET WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO IN THIS MATTER MR
MASON HE SAID AT LAST CANT YOU MAKE IT MORE DEFINITE
PERHAPS THIS WILL MAKE IT MORE DEFINITE MR HOLMES SAID OUR
VISITOR
HE TOOK A PAPER FROM HIS POCKET AND UNWRAPPING IT CAREFULLY HE
EXPOSED A CHARRED FRAGMENT OF BONE
HOLMES EXAMINED IT WITH INTEREST
WHERE DID YOU GET IT
THERE IS A CENTRAL HEATING FURNACE IN THE CELLAR UNDER LADY
BEATRICES ROOM ITS BEEN OFF FOR SOME TIME BUT SIR ROBERT
COMPLAINED OF COLD AND HAD IT ON AGAIN HARVEY RUNS ITHES ONE OF
MY LADS THIS VERY MORNING HE CAME TO ME WITH THIS WHICH HE FOUND
RAKING OUT THE CINDERS HE DIDNT LIKE THE LOOK OF IT
NOR DO I SAID HOLMES WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT WATSON
IT WAS BURNED TO A BLACK CINDER BUT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION AS TO
ITS ANATOMICAL SIGNIFICANCE
ITS THE UPPER CONDYLE OF A HUMAN FEMUR SAID I
EXACTLY HOLMES HAD BECOME VERY SERIOUS WHEN DOES THIS LAD TEND
TO THE FURNACE
HE MAKES IT UP EVERY EVENING AND THEN LEAVES IT
THEN ANYONE COULD VISIT IT DURING THE NIGHT
YES SIR
CAN YOU ENTER IT FROM OUTSIDE
THERE IS ONE DOOR FROM OUTSIDE THERE IS ANOTHER WHICH LEADS UP BY A
STAIR TO THE PASSAGE IN WHICH LADY BEATRICES ROOM IS SITUATED
THESE ARE DEEP WATERS MR MASON DEEP AND RATHER DIRTY YOU SAY
THAT SIR ROBERT WAS NOT AT HOME LAST NIGHT
NO SIR
THEN WHOEVER WAS BURNING BONES IT WAS NOT HE
THATS TRUE SIR
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THAT INN YOU SPOKE OF
THE GREEN DRAGON
IS THERE GOOD FISHING IN THAT PART OF BERKSHIRE THE HONEST TRAINER
SHOWED VERY CLEARLY UPON HIS FACE THAT HE WAS CONVINCED THAT YET
ANOTHER LUNATIC HAD COME INTO HIS HARASSED LIFE
WELL SIR IVE HEARD THERE ARE TROUT IN THE MILLSTREAM AND PIKE IN
THE HALL LAKE
THATS GOOD ENOUGH WATSON AND I ARE FAMOUS FISHERMENARE WE NOT
WATSON YOU MAY ADDRESS US IN FUTURE AT THE GREEN DRAGON WE SHOULD
REACH IT TONIGHT I NEED NOT SAY THAT WE DONT WANT TO SEE YOU MR
MASON BUT A NOTE WILL REACH US AND NO DOUBT I COULD FIND YOU IF I
WANT YOU WHEN WE HAVE GONE A LITTLE FARTHER INTO THE MATTER I WILL
LET YOU HAVE A CONSIDERED OPINION
THUS IT WAS THAT ON A BRIGHT MAY EVENING HOLMES AND I FOUND OURSELVES
ALONE IN A FIRSTCLASS CARRIAGE AND BOUND FOR THE LITTLE
HALTONDEMAND STATION OF SHOSCOMBE THE RACK ABOVE US WAS COVERED
WITH A FORMIDABLE LITTER OF RODS REELS AND BASKETS ON REACHING OUR
DESTINATION A SHORT DRIVE TOOK US TO AN OLDFASHIONED TAVERN WHERE A
SPORTING HOST JOSIAH BARNES ENTERED EAGERLY INTO OUR PLANS FOR THE
EXTIRPATION OF THE FISH OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
WHAT ABOUT THE HALL LAKE AND THE CHANCE OF A PIKE SAID HOLMES
THE FACE OF THE INNKEEPER CLOUDED
THAT WOULDNT DO SIR YOU MIGHT CHANCE TO FIND YOURSELF IN THE LAKE
BEFORE YOU WERE THROUGH
HOWS THAT THEN
ITS SIR ROBERT SIR HES TERRIBLE JEALOUS OF TOUTS IF YOU TWO
STRANGERS WERE AS NEAR HIS TRAINING QUARTERS AS THAT HED BE AFTER
YOU AS SURE AS FATE HE AINT TAKING NO CHANCES SIR ROBERT AINT
IVE HEARD HE HAS A HORSE ENTERED FOR THE DERBY
YES AND A GOOD COLT TOO HE CARRIES ALL OUR MONEY FOR THE RACE
AND ALL SIR ROBERTS INTO THE BARGAIN BY THE WAYHE LOOKED AT US
WITH THOUGHTFUL EYESI SUPPOSE YOU AINT ON THE TURF YOURSELVES
NO INDEED JUST TWO WEARY LONDONERS WHO BADLY NEED SOME GOOD
BERKSHIRE AIR
WELL YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THAT THERE IS A DEAL OF IT
LYING ABOUT BUT MIND WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT SIR ROBERT HES THE
SORT THAT STRIKES FIRST AND SPEAKS AFTERWARDS KEEP CLEAR OF THE
PARK
SURELY MR BARNES WE CERTAINLY SHALL BY THE WAY THAT WAS A MOST
BEAUTIFUL SPANIEL THAT WAS WHINING IN THE HALL
I SHOULD SAY IT WAS THAT WAS THE REAL SHOSCOMBE BREED THERE AINT
A BETTER IN ENGLAND
I AM A DOGFANCIER MYSELF SAID HOLMES NOW IF IT IS A FAIR
QUESTION WHAT WOULD A PRIZE DOG LIKE THAT COST
MORE THAN I COULD PAY SIR IT WAS SIR ROBERT HIMSELF WHO GAVE ME
THIS ONE THATS WHY I HAVE TO KEEP IT ON A LEAD IT WOULD BE OFF TO
THE HALL IN A JIFFY IF I GAVE IT ITS HEAD
WE ARE GETTING SOME CARDS IN OUR HAND WATSON SAID HOLMES WHEN THE
LANDLORD HAD LEFT US ITS NOT AN EASY ONE TO PLAY BUT WE MAY SEE
OUR WAY IN A DAY OR TWO BY THE WAY SIR ROBERT IS STILL IN LONDON I
HEAR WE MIGHT PERHAPS ENTER THE SACRED DOMAIN TONIGHT WITHOUT
FEAR OF BODILY ASSAULT THERE ARE ONE OR TWO POINTS ON WHICH I SHOULD
LIKE REASSURANCE
HAVE YOU ANY THEORY HOLMES
ONLY THIS WATSON THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED A WEEK OR SO AGO WHICH
HAS CUT DEEP INTO THE LIFE OF THE SHOSCOMBE HOUSEHOLD WHAT IS THAT
SOMETHING WE CAN ONLY GUESS AT IT FROM ITS EFFECTS THEY SEEM TO BE
OF A CURIOUSLY MIXED CHARACTER BUT THAT SHOULD SURELY HELP US IT IS
ONLY THE COLOURLESS UNEVENTFUL CASE WHICH IS HOPELESS
LET US CONSIDER OUR DATA THE BROTHER NO LONGER VISITS THE BELOVED
INVALID SISTER HE GIVES AWAY HER FAVOURITE DOG HER DOG WATSON
DOES THAT SUGGEST NOTHING TO YOU
NOTHING BUT THE BROTHERS SPITE
WELL IT MIGHT BE SO ORWELL THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE NOW TO
CONTINUE OUR REVIEW OF THE SITUATION FROM THE TIME THAT THE QUARREL
IF THERE IS A QUARREL BEGAN THE LADY KEEPS HER ROOM ALTERS HER
HABITS IS NOT SEEN SAVE WHEN SHE DRIVES OUT WITH HER MAID REFUSES
TO STOP AT THE STABLES TO GREET HER FAVOURITE HORSE AND APPARENTLY
TAKES TO DRINK THAT COVERS THE CASE DOES IT NOT
SAVE FOR THE BUSINESS IN THE CRYPT
THAT IS ANOTHER LINE OF THOUGHT THERE ARE TWO AND I BEG YOU WILL
NOT TANGLE THEM LINE A WHICH CONCERNS LADY BEATRICE HAS A VAGUELY
SINISTER FLAVOUR HAS IT NOT
I CAN MAKE NOTHING OF IT
WELL NOW LET US TAKE UP LINE B WHICH CONCERNS SIR ROBERT HE IS
MAD KEEN UPON WINNING THE DERBY HE IS IN THE HANDS OF THE JEWS AND
MAY AT ANY MOMENT BE SOLD UP AND HIS RACING STABLES SEIZED BY HIS
CREDITORS HE IS A DARING AND DESPERATE MAN HE DERIVES HIS INCOME
FROM HIS SISTER HIS SISTERS MAID IS HIS WILLING TOOL SO FAR WE
SEEM TO BE ON FAIRLY SAFE GROUND DO WE NOT
BUT THE CRYPT
AH YES THE CRYPT LET US SUPPOSE WATSONIT IS MERELY A
SCANDALOUS SUPPOSITION A HYPOTHESIS PUT FORWARD FOR ARGUMENTS
SAKETHAT SIR ROBERT HAS DONE AWAY WITH HIS SISTER
MY DEAR HOLMES IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION
VERY POSSIBLY WATSON SIR ROBERT IS A MAN OF AN HONOURABLE STOCK
BUT YOU DO OCCASIONALLY FIND A CARRION CROW AMONG THE EAGLES LET US
FOR A MOMENT ARGUE UPON THIS SUPPOSITION HE COULD NOT FLY THE
COUNTRY UNTIL HE HAD REALIZED HIS FORTUNE AND THAT FORTUNE COULD
ONLY BE REALIZED BY BRINGING OFF THIS COUP WITH SHOSCOMBE PRINCE
THEREFORE HE HAS STILL TO STAND HIS GROUND TO DO THIS HE WOULD HAVE
TO DISPOSE OF THE BODY OF HIS VICTIM AND HE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO FIND
A SUBSTITUTE WHO WOULD IMPERSONATE HER WITH THE MAID AS HIS
CONFIDANTE THAT WOULD NOT BE IMPOSSIBLE THE WOMANS BODY MIGHT BE
CONVEYED TO THE CRYPT WHICH IS A PLACE SO SELDOM VISITED AND IT
MIGHT BE SECRETLY DESTROYED AT NIGHT IN THE FURNACE LEAVING BEHIND
IT SUCH EVIDENCE AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN WHAT SAY YOU TO THAT
WATSON
WELL IT IS ALL POSSIBLE IF YOU GRANT THE ORIGINAL MONSTROUS
SUPPOSITION
I THINK THAT THERE IS A SMALL EXPERIMENT WHICH WE MAY TRY TOMORROW
WATSON IN ORDER TO THROW SOME LIGHT ON THE MATTER MEANWHILE IF WE
MEAN TO KEEP UP OUR CHARACTERS I SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE OUR HOST IN
FOR A GLASS OF HIS OWN WINE AND HOLD SOME HIGH CONVERSE UPON EELS AND
DACE WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE STRAIGHT ROAD TO HIS AFFECTIONS WE MAY
CHANCE TO COME UPON SOME USEFUL LOCAL GOSSIP IN THE PROCESS
IN THE MORNING HOLMES DISCOVERED THAT WE HAD COME WITHOUT OUR
SPOONBAIT FOR JACK WHICH ABSOLVED US FROM FISHING FOR THE DAY
ABOUT ELEVEN OCLOCK WE STARTED FOR A WALK AND HE OBTAINED LEAVE TO
TAKE THE BLACK SPANIEL WITH US
THIS IS THE PLACE SAID HE AS WE CAME TO TWO HIGH PARK GATES WITH
HERALDIC GRIFFINS TOWERING ABOVE THEM ABOUT MIDDAY MR BARNES
INFORMS ME THE OLD LADY TAKES A DRIVE AND THE CARRIAGE MUST SLOW
DOWN WHILE THE GATES ARE OPENED WHEN IT COMES THROUGH AND BEFORE IT
GATHERS SPEED I WANT YOU WATSON TO STOP THE COACHMAN WITH SOME
QUESTION NEVER MIND ME I SHALL STAND BEHIND THIS HOLLYBUSH AND SEE
WHAT I CAN SEE
IT WAS NOT A LONG VIGIL WITHIN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WE SAW THE BIG
OPEN YELLOW BAROUCHE COMING DOWN THE LONG AVENUE WITH TWO SPLENDID
HIGHSTEPPING GRAY CARRIAGE HORSES IN THE SHAFTS HOLMES CROUCHED
BEHIND HIS BUSH WITH THE DOG I STOOD UNCONCERNEDLY SWINGING A CANE
IN THE ROADWAY A KEEPER RAN OUT AND THE GATES SWUNG OPEN
THE CARRIAGE HAD SLOWED TO A WALK AND I WAS ABLE TO GET A GOOD LOOK
AT THE OCCUPANTS A HIGHLY COLOURED YOUNG WOMAN WITH FLAXEN HAIR AND
IMPUDENT EYES SAT ON THE LEFT AT HER RIGHT WAS AN ELDERLY PERSON
WITH ROUNDED BACK AND A HUDDLE OF SHAWLS ABOUT HER FACE AND SHOULDERS
WHICH PROCLAIMED THE INVALID WHEN THE HORSES REACHED THE HIGHROAD I
HELD UP MY HAND WITH AN AUTHORITATIVE GESTURE AND AS THE COACHMAN
PULLED UP I INQUIRED IF SIR ROBERT WAS AT SHOSCOMBE OLD PLACE
AT THE SAME MOMENT HOLMES STEPPED OUT AND RELEASED THE SPANIEL WITH
A JOYOUS CRY IT DASHED FORWARD TO THE CARRIAGE AND SPRANG UPON THE
STEP THEN IN A MOMENT ITS EAGER GREETING CHANGED TO FURIOUS RAGE
AND IT SNAPPED AT THE BLACK SKIRT ABOVE IT
DRIVE ON DRIVE ON SHRIEKED A HARSH VOICE THE COACHMAN LASHED THE
HORSES AND WE WERE LEFT STANDING IN THE ROADWAY
WELL WATSON THATS DONE IT SAID HOLMES AS HE FASTENED THE LEAD
TO THE NECK OF THE EXCITED SPANIEL HE THOUGHT IT WAS HIS MISTRESS
AND HE FOUND IT WAS A STRANGER DOGS DONT MAKE MISTAKES
BUT IT WAS THE VOICE OF A MAN I CRIED
EXACTLY WE HAVE ADDED ONE CARD TO OUR HAND WATSON BUT IT NEEDS
CAREFUL PLAYING ALL THE SAME
MY COMPANION SEEMED TO HAVE NO FURTHER PLANS FOR THE DAY AND WE DID
ACTUALLY USE OUR FISHING TACKLE IN THE MILLSTREAM WITH THE RESULT
THAT WE HAD A DISH OF TROUT FOR OUR SUPPER IT WAS ONLY AFTER THAT
MEAL THAT HOLMES SHOWED SIGNS OF RENEWED ACTIVITY ONCE MORE WE FOUND
OURSELVES UPON THE SAME ROAD AS IN THE MORNING WHICH LED US TO THE
PARK GATES A TALL DARK FIGURE WAS AWAITING US THERE WHO PROVED TO
BE OUR LONDON ACQUAINTANCE MR JOHN MASON THE TRAINER
GOODEVENING GENTLEMEN SAID HE I GOT YOUR NOTE MR HOLMES SIR
ROBERT HAS NOT RETURNED YET BUT I HEAR THAT HE IS EXPECTED
TONIGHT
HOW FAR IS THIS CRYPT FROM THE HOUSE ASKED HOLMES
A GOOD QUARTER OF A MILE
THEN I THINK WE CAN DISREGARD HIM ALTOGETHER
I CANT AFFORD TO DO THAT MR HOLMES THE MOMENT HE ARRIVES HE WILL
WANT TO SEE ME TO GET THE LAST NEWS OF SHOSCOMBE PRINCE
I SEE IN THAT CASE WE MUST WORK WITHOUT YOU MR MASON YOU CAN
SHOW US THE CRYPT AND THEN LEAVE US
IT WAS PITCHDARK AND WITHOUT A MOON BUT MASON LED US OVER THE
GRASSLANDS UNTIL A DARK MASS LOOMED UP IN FRONT OF US WHICH PROVED
TO BE THE ANCIENT CHAPEL WE ENTERED THE BROKEN GAP WHICH WAS ONCE
THE PORCH AND OUR GUIDE STUMBLING AMONG HEAPS OF LOOSE MASONRY
PICKED HIS WAY TO THE CORNER OF THE BUILDING WHERE A STEEP STAIR LED
DOWN INTO THE CRYPT STRIKING A MATCH HE ILLUMINATED THE MELANCHOLY
PLACEDISMAL AND EVILSMELLING WITH ANCIENT CRUMBLING WALLS OF
ROUGHHEWN STONE AND PILES OF COFFINS SOME OF LEAD AND SOME OF
STONE EXTENDING UPON ONE SIDE RIGHT UP TO THE ARCHED AND GROINED
ROOF WHICH LOST ITSELF IN THE SHADOWS ABOVE OUR HEADS HOLMES HAD LIT
HIS LANTERN WHICH SHOT A TINY TUNNEL OF VIVID YELLOW LIGHT UPON THE
MOURNFUL SCENE ITS RAYS WERE REFLECTED BACK FROM THE COFFINPLATES
MANY OF THEM ADORNED WITH THE GRIFFIN AND CORONET OF THIS OLD FAMILY
WHICH CARRIED ITS HONOURS EVEN TO THE GATE OF DEATH
YOU SPOKE OF SOME BONES MR MASON COULD YOU SHOW THEM BEFORE YOU
GO
THEY ARE HERE IN THIS CORNER THE TRAINER STRODE ACROSS AND THEN
STOOD IN SILENT SURPRISE AS OUR LIGHT WAS TURNED UPON THE PLACE
THEY ARE GONE SAID HE
SO I EXPECTED SAID HOLMES CHUCKLING I FANCY THE ASHES OF THEM
MIGHT EVEN NOW BE FOUND IN THAT OVEN WHICH HAD ALREADY CONSUMED A
PART
BUT WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD ANYONE WANT TO BURN THE BONES OF A MAN
WHO HAS BEEN DEAD A THOUSAND YEARS ASKED JOHN MASON
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE HERE TO FIND OUT SAID HOLMES IT MAY MEAN A
LONG SEARCH AND WE NEED NOT DETAIN YOU I FANCY THAT WE SHALL GET
OUR SOLUTION BEFORE MORNING
WHEN JOHN MASON HAD LEFT US HOLMES SET TO WORK MAKING A VERY CAREFUL
EXAMINATION OF THE GRAVES RANGING FROM A VERY ANCIENT ONE WHICH
APPEARED TO BE SAXON IN THE CENTRE THROUGH A LONG LINE OF NORMAN
HUGOS AND ODOS UNTIL WE REACHED THE SIR WILLIAM AND SIR DENIS FALDER
OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IT WAS AN HOUR OR MORE BEFORE HOLMES CAME
TO A LEADEN COFFIN STANDING ON END BEFORE THE ENTRANCE TO THE VAULT
I HEARD HIS LITTLE CRY OF SATISFACTION AND WAS AWARE FROM HIS HURRIED
BUT PURPOSEFUL MOVEMENTS THAT HE HAD REACHED A GOAL WITH HIS LENS HE
WAS EAGERLY EXAMINING THE EDGES OF THE HEAVY LID THEN HE DREW FROM
HIS POCKET A SHORT JEMMY A BOXOPENER WHICH HE THRUST INTO A CHINK
LEVERING BACK THE WHOLE FRONT WHICH SEEMED TO BE SECURED BY ONLY A
COUPLE OF CLAMPS THERE WAS A RENDING TEARING SOUND AS IT GAVE WAY
BUT IT HAD HARDLY HINGED BACK AND PARTLY REVEALED THE CONTENTS BEFORE
WE HAD AN UNFORESEEN INTERRUPTION
SOMEONE WAS WALKING IN THE CHAPEL ABOVE IT WAS THE FIRM RAPID STEP
OF ONE WHO CAME WITH A DEFINITE PURPOSE AND KNEW WELL THE GROUND UPON
WHICH HE WALKED A LIGHT STREAMED DOWN THE STAIRS AND AN INSTANT
LATER THE MAN WHO BORE IT WAS FRAMED IN THE GOTHIC ARCHWAY HE WAS A
TERRIBLE FIGURE HUGE IN STATURE AND FIERCE IN MANNER A LARGE
STABLELANTERN WHICH HE HELD IN FRONT OF HIM SHONE UPWARD UPON A
STRONG HEAVILY MOUSTACHED FACE AND ANGRY EYES WHICH GLARED ROUND
HIM INTO EVERY RECESS OF THE VAULT FINALLY FIXING THEMSELVES WITH A
DEADLY STARE UPON MY COMPANION AND MYSELF
WHO THE DEVIL ARE YOU HE THUNDERED AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING UPON
MY PROPERTY THEN AS HOLMES RETURNED NO ANSWER HE TOOK A COUPLE OF
STEPS FORWARD AND RAISED A HEAVY STICK WHICH HE CARRIED DO YOU HEAR
ME HE CRIED WHO ARE YOU WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HIS CUDGEL
QUIVERED IN THE AIR
BUT INSTEAD OF SHRINKING HOLMES ADVANCED TO MEET HIM
I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK YOU SIR ROBERT HE SAID IN HIS
STERNEST TONE WHO IS THIS AND WHAT IS IT DOING HERE
HE TURNED AND TORE OPEN THE COFFINLID BEHIND HIM IN THE GLARE OF
THE LANTERN I SAW A BODY SWATHED IN A SHEET FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH
DREADFUL WITCHLIKE FEATURES ALL NOSE AND CHIN PROJECTING AT ONE
END THE DIM GLAZED EYES STARING FROM A DISCOLOURED AND CRUMBLING
FACE
THE BARONET HAD STAGGERED BACK WITH A CRY AND SUPPORTED HIMSELF
AGAINST A STONE SARCOPHAGUS
HOW CAME YOU TO KNOW OF THIS HE CRIED AND THEN WITH SOME RETURN
OF HIS TRUCULENT MANNER WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF YOURS
MY NAME IS SHERLOCK HOLMES SAID MY COMPANION POSSIBLY IT IS
FAMILIAR TO YOU IN ANY CASE MY BUSINESS IS THAT OF EVERY OTHER GOOD
CITIZENTO UPHOLD THE LAW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU HAVE MUCH TO
ANSWER FOR
SIR ROBERT GLARED FOR A MOMENT BUT HOLMESS QUIET VOICE AND COOL
ASSURED MANNER HAD THEIR EFFECT
FORE GOD MR HOLMES ITS ALL RIGHT SAID HE APPEARANCES ARE
AGAINST ME ILL ADMIT BUT I COULD ACT NO OTHERWISE
I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO THINK SO BUT I FEAR YOUR EXPLANATIONS MUST BE
BEFORE THE POLICE
SIR ROBERT SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS
WELL IF IT MUST BE IT MUST COME UP TO THE HOUSE AND YOU CAN JUDGE
FOR YOURSELF HOW THE MATTER STANDS
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER WE FOUND OURSELVES IN WHAT I JUDGE FROM
THE LINES OF POLISHED BARRELS BEHIND GLASS COVERS TO BE THE GUNROOM
OF THE OLD HOUSE IT WAS COMFORTABLY FURNISHED AND HERE SIR ROBERT
LEFT US FOR A FEW MOMENTS WHEN HE RETURNED HE HAD TWO COMPANIONS
WITH HIM THE ONE THE FLORID YOUNG WOMAN WHOM WE HAD SEEN IN THE
CARRIAGE THE OTHER A SMALL RATFACED MAN WITH A DISAGREEABLY
FURTIVE MANNER THESE TWO WORE AN APPEARANCE OF UTTER BEWILDERMENT
WHICH SHOWED THAT THE BARONET HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO EXPLAIN TO THEM
THE TURN EVENTS HAD TAKEN
THERE SAID SIR ROBERT WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND ARE MR AND MRS
NORLETT MRS NORLETT UNDER HER MAIDEN NAME OF EVANS HAS FOR SOME
YEARS BEEN MY SISTERS CONFIDENTIAL MAID I HAVE BROUGHT THEM HERE
BECAUSE I FEEL THAT MY BEST COURSE IS TO EXPLAIN THE TRUE POSITION TO
YOU AND THEY ARE THE TWO PEOPLE UPON EARTH WHO CAN SUBSTANTIATE WHAT
I SAY
IS THIS NECESSARY SIR ROBERT HAVE YOU THOUGHT WHAT YOU ARE DOING
CRIED THE WOMAN
AS TO ME I ENTIRELY DISCLAIM ALL RESPONSIBILITY SAID HER HUSBAND
SIR ROBERT GAVE HIM A GLANCE OF CONTEMPT I WILL TAKE ALL
RESPONSIBILITY SAID HE NOW MR HOLMES LISTEN TO A PLAIN
STATEMENT OF THE FACTS
YOU HAVE CLEARLY GONE PRETTY DEEPLY INTO MY AFFAIRS OR I SHOULD NOT
HAVE FOUND YOU WHERE I DID THEREFORE YOU KNOW ALREADY IN ALL
PROBABILITY THAT I AM RUNNING A DARK HORSE FOR THE DERBY AND THAT
EVERYTHING DEPENDS UPON MY SUCCESS IF I WIN ALL IS EASY IF I
LOSEWELL I DARE NOT THINK OF THAT
I UNDERSTAND THE POSITION SAID HOLMES
I AM DEPENDENT UPON MY SISTER LADY BEATRICE FOR EVERYTHING BUT IT
IS WELL KNOWN THAT HER INTEREST IN THE ESTATE IS FOR HER OWN LIFE
ONLY FOR MYSELF I AM DEEPLY IN THE HANDS OF THE JEWS I HAVE ALWAYS
KNOWN THAT IF MY SISTER WERE TO DIE MY CREDITORS WOULD BE ON TO MY
ESTATE LIKE A FLOCK OF VULTURES EVERYTHING WOULD BE SEIZEDMY
STABLES MY HORSESEVERYTHING WELL MR HOLMES MY SISTER DID DIE
JUST A WEEK AGO
AND YOU TOLD NO ONE
WHAT COULD I DO ABSOLUTE RUIN FACED ME IF I COULD STAVE THINGS OFF
FOR THREE WEEKS ALL WOULD BE WELL HER MAIDS HUSBANDTHIS MAN
HEREIS AN ACTOR IT CAME INTO OUR HEADSIT CAME INTO MY HEADTHAT
HE COULD FOR THAT SHORT PERIOD PERSONATE MY SISTER IT WAS BUT A CASE
OF APPEARING DAILY IN THE CARRIAGE FOR NO ONE NEED ENTER HER ROOM
SAVE THE MAID IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO ARRANGE MY SISTER DIED OF THE
DROPSY WHICH HAD LONG AFFLICTED HER
THAT WILL BE FOR A CORONER TO DECIDE
HER DOCTOR WOULD CERTIFY THAT FOR MONTHS HER SYMPTOMS HAVE
THREATENED SUCH AN END
WELL WHAT DID YOU DO
THE BODY COULD NOT REMAIN THERE ON THE FIRST NIGHT NORLETT AND I
CARRIED IT OUT TO THE OLD WELLHOUSE WHICH IS NOW NEVER USED WE
WERE FOLLOWED HOWEVER BY HER PET SPANIEL WHICH YAPPED CONTINUALLY
AT THE DOOR SO I FELT SOME SAFER PLACE WAS NEEDED I GOT RID OF THE
SPANIEL AND WE CARRIED THE BODY TO THE CRYPT OF THE CHURCH THERE
WAS NO INDIGNITY OR IRREVERENCE MR HOLMES I DO NOT FEEL THAT I
HAVE WRONGED THE DEAD
YOUR CONDUCT SEEMS TO ME INEXCUSABLE SIR ROBERT
THE BARONET SHOOK HIS HEAD IMPATIENTLY IT IS EASY TO PREACH SAID
HE PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE FELT DIFFERENTLY IF YOU HAD BEEN IN MY
POSITION ONE CANNOT SEE ALL ONES HOPES AND ALL ONES PLANS
SHATTERED AT THE LAST MOMENT AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO SAVE THEM IT
SEEMED TO ME THAT IT WOULD BE NO UNWORTHY RESTINGPLACE IF WE PUT HER
FOR THE TIME IN ONE OF THE COFFINS OF HER HUSBANDS ANCESTORS LYING
IN WHAT IS STILL CONSECRATED GROUND WE OPENED SUCH A COFFIN REMOVED
THE CONTENTS AND PLACED HER AS YOU HAVE SEEN HER AS TO THE OLD
RELICS WHICH WE TOOK OUT WE COULD NOT LEAVE THEM ON THE FLOOR OF THE
CRYPT NORLETT AND I REMOVED THEM AND HE DESCENDED AT NIGHT AND
BURNED THEM IN THE CENTRAL FURNACE THERE IS MY STORY MR HOLMES
THOUGH HOW YOU FORCED MY HAND SO THAT I HAVE TO TELL IT IS MORE THAN
I CAN SAY
HOLMES SAT FOR SOME TIME LOST IN THOUGHT
THERE IS ONE FLAW IN YOUR NARRATIVE SIR ROBERT HE SAID AT LAST
YOUR BETS ON THE RACE AND THEREFORE YOUR HOPES FOR THE FUTURE
WOULD HOLD GOOD EVEN IF YOUR CREDITORS SEIZED YOUR ESTATE
THE HORSE WOULD BE PART OF THE ESTATE WHAT DO THEY CARE FOR MY
BETS AS LIKELY AS NOT THEY WOULD NOT RUN HIM AT ALL MY CHIEF
CREDITOR IS UNHAPPILY MY MOST BITTER ENEMYA RASCALLY FELLOW SAM
BREWER WHOM I WAS ONCE COMPELLED TO HORSEWHIP ON NEWMARKET HEATH DO
YOU SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD TRY TO SAVE ME
WELL SIR ROBERT SAID HOLMES RISING THIS MATTER MUST OF
COURSE BE REFERRED TO THE POLICE IT WAS MY DUTY TO BRING THE FACTS
TO LIGHT AND THERE I MUST LEAVE IT AS TO THE MORALITY OR DECENCY OF
YOUR CONDUCT IT IS NOT FOR ME TO EXPRESS AN OPINION IT IS NEARLY
MIDNIGHT WATSON AND I THINK WE MAY MAKE OUR WAY BACK TO OUR HUMBLE
ABODE
IT IS GENERALLY KNOWN NOW THAT THIS SINGULAR EPISODE ENDED UPON A
HAPPIER NOTE THAN SIR ROBERTS ACTIONS DESERVED SHOSCOMBE PRINCE DID
WIN THE DERBY THE SPORTING OWNER DID NET EIGHTY THOUSAND POUNDS IN
BETS AND THE CREDITORS DID HOLD THEIR HAND UNTIL THE RACE WAS OVER
WHEN THEY WERE PAID IN FULL AND ENOUGH WAS LEFT TO REESTABLISH SIR
ROBERT IN A FAIR POSITION IN LIFE BOTH POLICE AND CORONER TOOK A
LENIENT VIEW OF THE TRANSACTION AND BEYOND A MILD CENSURE FOR THE
DELAY IN REGISTERING THE LADYS DECEASE THE LUCKY OWNER GOT AWAY
SCATHELESS FROM THIS STRANGE INCIDENT IN A CAREER WHICH HAS NOW
OUTLIVED ITS SHADOWS AND PROMISES TO END IN AN HONOURED OLD AGE
THE ADVENTURE OF THE RETIRED COLOURMAN
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS IN A MELANCHOLY AND PHILOSOPHIC MOOD THAT
MORNING HIS ALERT PRACTICAL NATURE WAS SUBJECT TO SUCH REACTIONS
DID YOU SEE HIM HE ASKED
YOU MEAN THE OLD FELLOW WHO HAS JUST GONE OUT
PRECISELY
YES I MET HIM AT THE DOOR
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF HIM
A PATHETIC FUTILE BROKEN CREATURE
EXACTLY WATSON PATHETIC AND FUTILE BUT IS NOT ALL LIFE PATHETIC
AND FUTILE IS NOT HIS STORY A MICROCOSM OF THE WHOLE WE REACH WE
GRASP AND WHAT IS LEFT IN OUR HANDS AT THE END A SHADOW OR WORSE
THAN A SHADOWMISERY
IS HE ONE OF YOUR CLIENTS
WELL I SUPPOSE I MAY CALL HIM SO HE HAS BEEN SENT ON BY THE YARD
JUST AS MEDICAL MEN OCCASIONALLY SEND THEIR INCURABLES TO A QUACK
THEY ARGUE THAT THEY CAN DO NOTHING MORE AND THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS
THE PATIENT CAN BE NO WORSE THAN HE IS
WHAT IS THE MATTER
HOLMES TOOK A RATHER SOILED CARD FROM THE TABLE JOSIAH AMBERLEY HE
SAYS HE WAS JUNIOR PARTNER OF BRICKFALL AND AMBERLEY WHO ARE
MANUFACTURERS OF ARTISTIC MATERIALS YOU WILL SEE THEIR NAMES UPON
PAINTBOXES HE MADE HIS LITTLE PILE RETIRED FROM BUSINESS AT THE
AGE OF SIXTYONE BOUGHT A HOUSE AT LEWISHAM AND SETTLED DOWN TO
REST AFTER A LIFE OF CEASELESS GRIND ONE WOULD THINK HIS FUTURE WAS
TOLERABLY ASSURED
YES INDEED
HOLMES GLANCED OVER SOME NOTES WHICH HE HAD SCRIBBLED UPON THE BACK
OF AN ENVELOPE
RETIRED IN WATSON EARLY IN HE MARRIED A WOMAN TWENTY
YEARS YOUNGER THAN HIMSELFA GOODLOOKING WOMAN TOO IF THE
PHOTOGRAPH DOES NOT FLATTER A COMPETENCE A WIFE LEISUREIT SEEMED
A STRAIGHT ROAD WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM AND YET WITHIN TWO YEARS HE IS
AS YOU HAVE SEEN AS BROKEN AND MISERABLE A CREATURE AS CRAWLS
BENEATH THE SUN
BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED
THE OLD STORY WATSON A TREACHEROUS FRIEND AND A FICKLE WIFE IT
WOULD APPEAR THAT AMBERLEY HAS ONE HOBBY IN LIFE AND IT IS CHESS
NOT FAR FROM HIM AT LEWISHAM THERE LIVES A YOUNG DOCTOR WHO IS ALSO A
CHESSPLAYER I HAVE NOTED HIS NAME AS DR RAY ERNEST ERNEST WAS
FREQUENTLY IN THE HOUSE AND AN INTIMACY BETWEEN HIM AND MRS
AMBERLEY WAS A NATURAL SEQUENCE FOR YOU MUST ADMIT THAT OUR
UNFORTUNATE CLIENT HAS FEW OUTWARD GRACES WHATEVER HIS INNER VIRTUES
MAY BE THE COUPLE WENT OFF TOGETHER LAST WEEKDESTINATION UNTRACED
WHAT IS MORE THE FAITHLESS SPOUSE CARRIED OFF THE OLD MANS DEEDBOX
AS HER PERSONAL LUGGAGE WITH A GOOD PART OF HIS LIFES SAVINGS
WITHIN CAN WE FIND THE LADY CAN WE SAVE THE MONEY A COMMONPLACE
PROBLEM SO FAR AS IT HAS DEVELOPED AND YET A VITAL ONE FOR JOSIAH
AMBERLEY
WHAT WILL YOU DO ABOUT IT
WELL THE IMMEDIATE QUESTION MY DEAR WATSON HAPPENS TO BE WHAT
WILL YOU DOIF YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTUDY ME YOU KNOW
THAT I AM PREOCCUPIED WITH THIS CASE OF THE TWO COPTIC PATRIARCHS
WHICH SHOULD COME TO A HEAD TODAY I REALLY HAVE NOT TIME TO GO OUT
TO LEWISHAM AND YET EVIDENCE TAKEN ON THE SPOT HAS A SPECIAL VALUE
THE OLD FELLOW WAS QUITE INSISTENT THAT I SHOULD GO BUT I EXPLAINED
MY DIFFICULTY HE IS PREPARED TO MEET A REPRESENTATIVE
BY ALL MEANS I ANSWERED I CONFESS I DONT SEE THAT I CAN BE OF
MUCH SERVICE BUT I AM WILLING TO DO MY BEST AND SO IT WAS THAT ON
A SUMMER AFTERNOON I SET FORTH TO LEWISHAM LITTLE DREAMING THAT
WITHIN A WEEK THE AFFAIR IN WHICH I WAS ENGAGING WOULD BE THE EAGER
DEBATE OF ALL ENGLAND
IT WAS LATE THAT EVENING BEFORE I RETURNED TO BAKER STREET AND GAVE
AN ACCOUNT OF MY MISSION HOLMES LAY WITH HIS GAUNT FIGURE STRETCHED
IN HIS DEEP CHAIR HIS PIPE CURLING FORTH SLOW WREATHS OF ACRID
TOBACCO WHILE HIS EYELIDS DROOPED OVER HIS EYES SO LAZILY THAT HE
MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN ASLEEP WERE IT NOT THAT AT ANY HALT OR
QUESTIONABLE PASSAGE OF MY NARRATIVE THEY HALF LIFTED AND TWO GRAY
EYES AS BRIGHT AND KEEN AS RAPIERS TRANSFIXED ME WITH THEIR
SEARCHING GLANCE
THE HAVEN IS THE NAME OF MR JOSIAH AMBERLEYS HOUSE I EXPLAINED
I THINK IT WOULD INTEREST YOU HOLMES IT IS LIKE SOME PENURIOUS
PATRICIAN WHO HAS SUNK INTO THE COMPANY OF HIS INFERIORS YOU KNOW
THAT PARTICULAR QUARTER THE MONOTONOUS BRICK STREETS THE WEARY
SUBURBAN HIGHWAYS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM A LITTLE ISLAND OF
ANCIENT CULTURE AND COMFORT LIES THIS OLD HOME SURROUNDED BY A HIGH
SUNBAKED WALL MOTTLED WITH LICHENS AND TOPPED WITH MOSS THE SORT OF
WALL
CUT OUT THE POETRY WATSON SAID HOLMES SEVERELY I NOTE THAT IT
WAS A HIGH BRICK WALL
EXACTLY I SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN WHICH WAS THE HAVEN HAD I NOT ASKED
A LOUNGER WHO WAS SMOKING IN THE STREET I HAVE A REASON FOR
MENTIONING HIM HE WAS A TALL DARK HEAVILY MOUSTACHED RATHER
MILITARYLOOKING MAN HE NODDED IN ANSWER TO MY INQUIRY AND GAVE ME A
CURIOUSLY QUESTIONING GLANCE WHICH CAME BACK TO MY MEMORY A LITTLE
LATER
I HAD HARDLY ENTERED THE GATEWAY BEFORE I SAW MR AMBERLEY COMING
DOWN THE DRIVE I ONLY HAD A GLIMPSE OF HIM THIS MORNING AND HE
CERTAINLY GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION OF A STRANGE CREATURE BUT WHEN I
SAW HIM IN FULL LIGHT HIS APPEARANCE WAS EVEN MORE ABNORMAL
I HAVE OF COURSE STUDIED IT AND YET I SHOULD BE INTERESTED TO
HAVE YOUR IMPRESSION SAID HOLMES
HE SEEMED TO ME LIKE A MAN WHO WAS LITERALLY BOWED DOWN BY CARE HIS
BACK WAS CURVED AS THOUGH HE CARRIED A HEAVY BURDEN YET HE WAS NOT
THE WEAKLING THAT I HAD AT FIRST IMAGINED FOR HIS SHOULDERS AND
CHEST HAVE THE FRAMEWORK OF A GIANT THOUGH HIS FIGURE TAPERS AWAY
INTO A PAIR OF SPINDLED LEGS
LEFT SHOE WRINKLED RIGHT ONE SMOOTH
I DID NOT OBSERVE THAT
NO YOU WOULDNT I SPOTTED HIS ARTIFICIAL LIMB BUT PROCEED
I WAS STRUCK BY THE SNAKY LOCKS OF GRIZZLED HAIR WHICH CURLED FROM
UNDER HIS OLD STRAW HAT AND HIS FACE WITH ITS FIERCE EAGER
EXPRESSION AND THE DEEPLY LINED FEATURES
VERY GOOD WATSON WHAT DID HE SAY
HE BEGAN POURING OUT THE STORY OF HIS GRIEVANCES WE WALKED DOWN THE
DRIVE TOGETHER AND OF COURSE I TOOK A GOOD LOOK ROUND I HAVE NEVER
SEEN A WORSEKEPT PLACE THE GARDEN WAS ALL RUNNING TO SEED GIVING
ME AN IMPRESSION OF WILD NEGLECT IN WHICH THE PLANTS HAD BEEN ALLOWED
TO FIND THE WAY OF NATURE RATHER THAN OF ART HOW ANY DECENT WOMAN
COULD HAVE TOLERATED SUCH A STATE OF THINGS I DONT KNOW THE HOUSE
TOO WAS SLATTERNLY TO THE LAST DEGREE BUT THE POOR MAN SEEMED
HIMSELF TO BE AWARE OF IT AND TO BE TRYING TO REMEDY IT FOR A GREAT
POT OF GREEN PAINT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE HALL AND HE WAS
CARRYING A THICK BRUSH IN HIS LEFT HAND HE HAD BEEN WORKING ON THE
WOODWORK
HE TOOK ME INTO HIS DINGY SANCTUM AND WE HAD A LONG CHAT OF
COURSE HE WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU HAD NOT COME YOURSELF I HARDLY
EXPECTED HE SAID THAT SO HUMBLE AN INDIVIDUAL AS MYSELF
ESPECIALLY AFTER MY HEAVY FINANCIAL LOSS COULD OBTAIN THE COMPLETE
ATTENTION OF SO FAMOUS A MAN AS MR SHERLOCK HOLMES
I ASSURED HIM THAT THE FINANCIAL QUESTION DID NOT ARISE NO OF
COURSE IT IS ART FOR ARTS SAKE WITH HIM SAID HE BUT EVEN ON THE
ARTISTIC SIDE OF CRIME HE MIGHT HAVE FOUND SOMETHING HERE TO STUDY
AND HUMAN NATURE DR WATSONTHE BLACK INGRATITUDE OF IT ALL WHEN
DID I EVER REFUSE ONE OF HER REQUESTS WAS EVER A WOMAN SO PAMPERED
AND THAT YOUNG MANHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MY OWN SON HE HAD THE RUN OF
MY HOUSE AND YET SEE HOW THEY HAVE TREATED ME OH DR WATSON IT IS
A DREADFUL DREADFUL WORLD
THAT WAS THE BURDEN OF HIS SONG FOR AN HOUR OR MORE HE HAD IT
SEEMS NO SUSPICION OF AN INTRIGUE THEY LIVED ALONE SAVE FOR A WOMAN
WHO COMES IN BY THE DAY AND LEAVES EVERY EVENING AT SIX ON THAT
PARTICULAR EVENING OLD AMBERLEY WISHING TO GIVE HIS WIFE A TREAT
HAD TAKEN TWO UPPER CIRCLE SEATS AT THE HAYMARKET THEATRE AT THE
LAST MOMENT SHE HAD COMPLAINED OF A HEADACHE AND HAD REFUSED TO GO
HE HAD GONE ALONE THERE SEEMED TO BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE FACT FOR HE
PRODUCED THE UNUSED TICKET WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FOR HIS WIFE
THAT IS REMARKABLEMOST REMARKABLE SAID HOLMES WHOSE INTEREST IN
THE CASE SEEMED TO BE RISING PRAY CONTINUE WATSON I FIND YOUR
NARRATIVE MOST ARRESTING DID YOU PERSONALLY EXAMINE THIS TICKET YOU
DID NOT PERCHANCE TAKE THE NUMBER
IT SO HAPPENS THAT I DID I ANSWERED WITH SOME PRIDE IT CHANCED
TO BE MY OLD SCHOOL NUMBER THIRTYONE AND SO IS STUCK IN MY HEAD
EXCELLENT WATSON HIS SEAT THEN WAS EITHER THIRTY OR THIRTYTWO
QUITE SO I ANSWERED WITH SOME MYSTIFICATION AND ON B ROW
THAT IS MOST SATISFACTORY WHAT ELSE DID HE TELL YOU
HE SHOWED ME HIS STRONGROOM AS HE CALLED IT IT REALLY IS A
STRONGROOMLIKE A BANKWITH IRON DOOR AND SHUTTERBURGLARPROOF
AS HE CLAIMED HOWEVER THE WOMAN SEEMS TO HAVE HAD A DUPLICATE KEY
AND BETWEEN THEM THEY HAD CARRIED OFF SOME SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS
WORTH OF CASH AND SECURITIES
SECURITIES HOW COULD THEY DISPOSE OF THOSE
HE SAID THAT HE HAD GIVEN THE POLICE A LIST AND THAT HE HOPED THEY
WOULD BE UNSALEABLE HE HAD GOT BACK FROM THE THEATRE ABOUT MIDNIGHT
AND FOUND THE PLACE PLUNDERED THE DOOR AND WINDOW OPEN AND THE
FUGITIVES GONE THERE WAS NO LETTER OR MESSAGE NOR HAS HE HEARD A
WORD SINCE HE AT ONCE GAVE THE ALARM TO THE POLICE
HOLMES BROODED FOR SOME MINUTES
YOU SAY HE WAS PAINTING WHAT WAS HE PAINTING
WELL HE WAS PAINTING THE PASSAGE BUT HE HAD ALREADY PAINTED THE
DOOR AND WOODWORK OF THIS ROOM I SPOKE OF
DOES IT NOT STRIKE YOU AS A STRANGE OCCUPATION IN THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
ONE MUST DO SOMETHING TO EASE AN ACHING HEART THAT WAS HIS OWN
EXPLANATION IT WAS ECCENTRIC NO DOUBT BUT HE IS CLEARLY AN
ECCENTRIC MAN HE TORE UP ONE OF HIS WIFES PHOTOGRAPHS IN MY
PRESENCETORE IT UP FURIOUSLY IN A TEMPEST OF PASSION I NEVER WISH
TO SEE HER DAMNED FACE AGAIN HE SHRIEKED
ANYTHING MORE WATSON
YES ONE THING WHICH STRUCK ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE I HAD DRIVEN
TO THE BLACKHEATH STATION AND HAD CAUGHT MY TRAIN THERE WHEN JUST AS
IT WAS STARTING I SAW A MAN DART INTO THE CARRIAGE NEXT TO MY OWN
YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE A QUICK EYE FOR FACES HOLMES IT WAS
UNDOUBTEDLY THE TALL DARK MAN WHOM I HAD ADDRESSED IN THE STREET I
SAW HIM ONCE MORE AT LONDON BRIDGE AND THEN I LOST HIM IN THE CROWD
BUT I AM CONVINCED THAT HE WAS FOLLOWING ME
NO DOUBT NO DOUBT SAID HOLMES A TALL DARK HEAVILY MOUSTACHED
MAN YOU SAY WITH GRAYTINTED SUNGLASSES
HOLMES YOU ARE A WIZARD I DID NOT SAY SO BUT HE HAD GRAYTINTED
SUNGLASSES
AND A MASONIC TIEPIN
HOLMES
QUITE SIMPLE MY DEAR WATSON BUT LET US GET DOWN TO WHAT IS
PRACTICAL I MUST ADMIT TO YOU THAT THE CASE WHICH SEEMED TO ME TO
BE SO ABSURDLY SIMPLE AS TO BE HARDLY WORTH MY NOTICE IS RAPIDLY
ASSUMING A VERY DIFFERENT ASPECT IT IS TRUE THAT THOUGH IN YOUR
MISSION YOU HAVE MISSED EVERYTHING OF IMPORTANCE YET EVEN THOSE
THINGS WHICH HAVE OBTRUDED THEMSELVES UPON YOUR NOTICE GIVE RISE TO
SERIOUS THOUGHT
WHAT HAVE I MISSED
DONT BE HURT MY DEAR FELLOW YOU KNOW THAT I AM QUITE IMPERSONAL
NO ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER SOME POSSIBLY NOT SO WELL BUT
CLEARLY YOU HAVE MISSED SOME VITAL POINTS WHAT IS THE OPINION OF THE
NEIGHBOURS ABOUT THIS MAN AMBERLEY AND HIS WIFE THAT SURELY IS OF
IMPORTANCE WHAT OF DR ERNEST WAS HE THE GAY LOTHARIO ONE WOULD
EXPECT WITH YOUR NATURAL ADVANTAGES WATSON EVERY LADY IS YOUR
HELPER AND ACCOMPLICE WHAT ABOUT THE GIRL AT THE POSTOFFICE OR THE
WIFE OF THE GREENGROCER I CAN PICTURE YOU WHISPERING SOFT NOTHINGS
WITH THE YOUNG LADY AT THE BLUE ANCHOR AND RECEIVING HARD SOMETHINGS
IN EXCHANGE ALL THIS YOU HAVE LEFT UNDONE
IT CAN STILL BE DONE
IT HAS BEEN DONE THANKS TO THE TELEPHONE AND THE HELP OF THE YARD
I CAN USUALLY GET MY ESSENTIALS WITHOUT LEAVING THIS ROOM AS A
MATTER OF FACT MY INFORMATION CONFIRMS THE MANS STORY HE HAS THE
LOCAL REPUTE OF BEING A MISER AS WELL AS A HARSH AND EXACTING
HUSBAND THAT HE HAD A LARGE SUM OF MONEY IN THAT STRONGROOM OF HIS
IS CERTAIN SO ALSO IS IT THAT YOUNG DR ERNEST AN UNMARRIED MAN
PLAYED CHESS WITH AMBERLEY AND PROBABLY PLAYED THE FOOL WITH HIS
WIFE ALL THIS SEEMS PLAIN SAILING AND ONE WOULD THINK THAT THERE
WAS NO MORE TO BE SAIDAND YETAND YET
WHERE LIES THE DIFFICULTY
IN MY IMAGINATION PERHAPS WELL LEAVE IT THERE WATSON LET US
ESCAPE FROM THIS WEARY WORKADAY WORLD BY THE SIDE DOOR OF MUSIC
CARINA SINGS TONIGHT AT THE ALBERT HALL AND WE STILL HAVE TIME TO
DRESS DINE AND ENJOY
IN THE MORNING I WAS UP BETIMES BUT SOME TOAST CRUMBS AND TWO EMPTY
EGGSHELLS TOLD ME THAT MY COMPANION WAS EARLIER STILL I FOUND A
SCRIBBLED NOTE UPON THE TABLE
DEAR WATSON
THERE ARE ONE OR TWO POINTS OF CONTACT WHICH I SHOULD WISH TO
ESTABLISH WITH MR JOSIAH AMBERLEY WHEN I HAVE DONE SO WE CAN
DISMISS THE CASEOR NOT I WOULD ONLY ASK YOU TO BE ON HAND ABOUT
THREE OCLOCK AS I CONCEIVE IT POSSIBLE THAT I MAY WANT YOU
S H
I SAW NOTHING OF HOLMES ALL DAY BUT AT THE HOUR NAMED HE RETURNED
GRAVE PREOCCUPIED AND ALOOF AT SUCH TIMES IT WAS WISER TO LEAVE
HIM TO HIMSELF
HAS AMBERLEY BEEN HERE YET
NO
AH I AM EXPECTING HIM
HE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED FOR PRESENTLY THE OLD FELLOW ARRIVED WITH A
VERY WORRIED AND PUZZLED EXPRESSION UPON HIS AUSTERE FACE
IVE HAD A TELEGRAM MR HOLMES I CAN MAKE NOTHING OF IT HE
HANDED IT OVER AND HOLMES READ IT ALOUD
COME AT ONCE WITHOUT FAIL CAN GIVE YOU INFORMATION AS TO YOUR
RECENT LOSS
ELMAN
THE VICARAGE
DISPATCHED AT FROM LITTLE PURLINGTON SAID HOLMES LITTLE
PURLINGTON IS IN ESSEX I BELIEVE NOT FAR FROM FRINTON WELL OF
COURSE YOU WILL START AT ONCE THIS IS EVIDENTLY FROM A RESPONSIBLE
PERSON THE VICAR OF THE PLACE WHERE IS MY CROCKFORD YES HERE WE
HAVE HIM J C ELMAN M A LIVING OF MOOSMOOR CUM LITTLE
PURLINGTON LOOK UP THE TRAINS WATSON
THERE IS ONE AT FROM LIVERPOOL STREET
EXCELLENT YOU HAD BEST GO WITH HIM WATSON HE MAY NEED HELP OR
ADVICE CLEARLY WE HAVE COME TO A CRISIS IN THIS AFFAIR
BUT OUR CLIENT SEEMED BY NO MEANS EAGER TO START
ITS PERFECTLY ABSURD MR HOLMES HE SAID WHAT CAN THIS MAN
POSSIBLY KNOW OF WHAT HAS OCCURRED IT IS WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY
HE WOULD NOT HAVE TELEGRAPHED TO YOU IF HE DID NOT KNOW SOMETHING
WIRE AT ONCE THAT YOU ARE COMING
I DONT THINK I SHALL GO
HOLMES ASSUMED HIS STERNEST ASPECT
IT WOULD MAKE THE WORST POSSIBLE IMPRESSION BOTH ON THE POLICE AND
UPON MYSELF MR AMBERLEY IF WHEN SO OBVIOUS A CLUE AROSE YOU SHOULD
REFUSE TO FOLLOW IT UP WE SHOULD FEEL THAT YOU WERE NOT REALLY IN
EARNEST IN THIS INVESTIGATION
OUR CLIENT SEEMED HORRIFIED AT THE SUGGESTION
WHY OF COURSE I SHALL GO IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN THAT WAY SAID HE
ON THE FACE OF IT IT SEEMS ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THAT THIS PERSON KNOWS
ANYTHING BUT IF YOU THINK
I DO THINK SAID HOLMES WITH EMPHASIS AND SO WE WERE LAUNCHED UPON
OUR JOURNEY HOLMES TOOK ME ASIDE BEFORE WE LEFT THE ROOM AND GAVE ME
ONE WORD OF COUNSEL WHICH SHOWED THAT HE CONSIDERED THE MATTER TO BE
OF IMPORTANCE WHATEVER YOU DO SEE THAT HE REALLY DOES GO SAID
HE SHOULD HE BREAK AWAY OR RETURN GET TO THE NEAREST TELEPHONE
EXCHANGE AND SEND THE SINGLE WORD BOLTED I WILL ARRANGE HERE THAT
IT SHALL REACH ME WHEREVER I AM
LITTLE PURLINGTON IS NOT AN EASY PLACE TO REACH FOR IT IS ON A
BRANCH LINE MY REMEMBRANCE OF THE JOURNEY IS NOT A PLEASANT ONE FOR
THE WEATHER WAS HOT THE TRAIN SLOW AND MY COMPANION SULLEN AND
SILENT HARDLY TALKING AT ALL SAVE TO MAKE AN OCCASIONAL SARDONIC
REMARK AS TO THE FUTILITY OF OUR PROCEEDINGS WHEN WE AT LAST REACHED
THE LITTLE STATION IT WAS A TWOMILE DRIVE BEFORE WE CAME TO THE
VICARAGE WHERE A BIG SOLEMN RATHER POMPOUS CLERGYMAN RECEIVED US
IN HIS STUDY OUR TELEGRAM LAY BEFORE HIM
WELL GENTLEMEN HE ASKED WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU
WE CAME I EXPLAINED IN ANSWER TO YOUR WIRE
MY WIRE I SENT NO WIRE
I MEAN THE WIRE WHICH YOU SENT TO MR JOSIAH AMBERLEY ABOUT HIS WIFE
AND HIS MONEY
IF THIS IS A JOKE SIR IT IS A VERY QUESTIONABLE ONE SAID THE
VICAR ANGRILY I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE GENTLEMAN YOU NAME AND I
HAVE NOT SENT A WIRE TO ANYONE
OUR CLIENT AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN AMAZEMENT
PERHAPS THERE IS SOME MISTAKE SAID I ARE THERE PERHAPS TWO
VICARAGES HERE IS THE WIRE ITSELF SIGNED ELMAN AND DATED FROM THE
VICARAGE
THERE IS ONLY ONE VICARAGE SIR AND ONLY ONE VICAR AND THIS WIRE
IS A SCANDALOUS FORGERY THE ORIGIN OF WHICH SHALL CERTAINLY BE
INVESTIGATED BY THE POLICE MEANWHILE I CAN SEE NO POSSIBLE OBJECT
IN PROLONGING THIS INTERVIEW
SO MR AMBERLEY AND I FOUND OURSELVES ON THE ROADSIDE IN WHAT SEEMED
TO ME TO BE THE MOST PRIMITIVE VILLAGE IN ENGLAND WE MADE FOR THE
TELEGRAPH OFFICE BUT IT WAS ALREADY CLOSED THERE WAS A TELEPHONE
HOWEVER AT THE LITTLE RAILWAY ARMS AND BY IT I GOT INTO TOUCH WITH
HOLMES WHO SHARED IN OUR AMAZEMENT AT THE RESULT OF OUR JOURNEY
MOST SINGULAR SAID THE DISTANT VOICE MOST REMARKABLE I MUCH
FEAR MY DEAR WATSON THAT THERE IS NO RETURN TRAIN TONIGHT I HAVE
UNWITTINGLY CONDEMNED YOU TO THE HORRORS OF A COUNTRY INN HOWEVER
THERE IS ALWAYS NATURE WATSONNATURE AND JOSIAH AMBERLEYYOU CAN
BE IN CLOSE COMMUNE WITH BOTH I HEARD HIS DRY CHUCKLE AS HE TURNED
AWAY
IT WAS SOON APPARENT TO ME THAT MY COMPANIONS REPUTATION AS A MISER
WAS NOT UNDESERVED HE HAD GRUMBLED AT THE EXPENSE OF THE JOURNEY
HAD INSISTED UPON TRAVELLING THIRDCLASS AND WAS NOW CLAMOROUS IN
HIS OBJECTIONS TO THE HOTEL BILL NEXT MORNING WHEN WE DID AT LAST
ARRIVE IN LONDON IT WAS HARD TO SAY WHICH OF US WAS IN THE WORSE
HUMOUR
YOU HAD BEST TAKE BAKER STREET AS WE PASS SAID I MR HOLMES MAY
HAVE SOME FRESH INSTRUCTIONS
IF THEY ARE NOT WORTH MORE THAN THE LAST ONES THEY ARE NOT OF MUCH
USE SAID AMBERLEY WITH A MALEVOLENT SCOWL NONE THE LESS HE KEPT
ME COMPANY I HAD ALREADY WARNED HOLMES BY TELEGRAM OF THE HOUR OF
OUR ARRIVAL BUT WE FOUND A MESSAGE WAITING THAT HE WAS AT LEWISHAM
AND WOULD EXPECT US THERE THAT WAS A SURPRISE BUT AN EVEN GREATER
ONE WAS TO FIND THAT HE WAS NOT ALONE IN THE SITTINGROOM OF OUR
CLIENT A STERNLOOKING IMPASSIVE MAN SAT BESIDE HIM A DARK MAN
WITH GRAYTINTED GLASSES AND A LARGE MASONIC PIN PROJECTING FROM HIS
TIE
THIS IS MY FRIEND MR BARKER SAID HOLMES HE HAS BEEN INTERESTING
HIMSELF ALSO IN YOUR BUSINESS MR JOSIAH AMBERLEY THOUGH WE HAVE
BEEN WORKING INDEPENDENTLY BUT WE BOTH HAVE THE SAME QUESTION TO ASK
YOU
MR AMBERLEY SAT DOWN HEAVILY HE SENSED IMPENDING DANGER I READ IT
IN HIS STRAINING EYES AND HIS TWITCHING FEATURES
WHAT IS THE QUESTION MR HOLMES
ONLY THIS WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE BODIES
THE MAN SPRANG TO HIS FEET WITH A HOARSE SCREAM HE CLAWED INTO THE
AIR WITH HIS BONY HANDS HIS MOUTH WAS OPEN AND FOR THE INSTANT HE
LOOKED LIKE SOME HORRIBLE BIRD OF PREY IN A FLASH WE GOT A GLIMPSE
OF THE REAL JOSIAH AMBERLEY A MISSHAPEN DEMON WITH A SOUL AS
DISTORTED AS HIS BODY AS HE FELL BACK INTO HIS CHAIR HE CLAPPED HIS
HAND TO HIS LIPS AS IF TO STIFLE A COUGH HOLMES SPRANG AT HIS THROAT
LIKE A TIGER AND TWISTED HIS FACE TOWARDS THE GROUND A WHITE PELLET
FELL FROM BETWEEN HIS GASPING LIPS
NO SHORT CUTS JOSIAH AMBERLEY THINGS MUST BE DONE DECENTLY AND IN
ORDER WHAT ABOUT IT BARKER
I HAVE A CAB AT THE DOOR SAID OUR TACITURN COMPANION
IT IS ONLY A FEW HUNDRED YARDS TO THE STATION WE WILL GO TOGETHER
YOU CAN STAY HERE WATSON I SHALL BE BACK WITHIN HALF AN HOUR
THE OLD COLOURMAN HAD THE STRENGTH OF A LION IN THAT GREAT TRUNK OF
HIS BUT HE WAS HELPLESS IN THE HANDS OF THE TWO EXPERIENCED
MANHANDLERS WRIGGLING AND TWISTING HE WAS DRAGGED TO THE WAITING
CAB AND I WAS LEFT TO MY SOLITARY VIGIL IN THE ILLOMENED HOUSE IN
LESS TIME THAN HE HAD NAMED HOWEVER HOLMES WAS BACK IN COMPANY
WITH A SMART YOUNG POLICE INSPECTOR
IVE LEFT BARKER TO LOOK AFTER THE FORMALITIES SAID HOLMES YOU
HAD NOT MET BARKER WATSON HE IS MY HATED RIVAL UPON THE SURREY
SHORE WHEN YOU SAID A TALL DARK MAN IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO
COMPLETE THE PICTURE HE HAS SEVERAL GOOD CASES TO HIS CREDIT HAS HE
NOT INSPECTOR
HE HAS CERTAINLY INTERFERED SEVERAL TIMES THE INSPECTOR ANSWERED
WITH RESERVE
HIS METHODS ARE IRREGULAR NO DOUBT LIKE MY OWN THE IRREGULARS ARE
USEFUL SOMETIMES YOU KNOW YOU FOR EXAMPLE WITH YOUR COMPULSORY
WARNING ABOUT WHATEVER HE SAID BEING USED AGAINST HIM COULD NEVER
HAVE BLUFFED THIS RASCAL INTO WHAT IS VIRTUALLY A CONFESSION
PERHAPS NOT BUT WE GET THERE ALL THE SAME MR HOLMES DONT
IMAGINE THAT WE HAD NOT FORMED OUR OWN VIEWS OF THIS CASE AND THAT
WE WOULD NOT HAVE LAID OUR HANDS ON OUR MAN YOU WILL EXCUSE US FOR
FEELING SORE WHEN YOU JUMP IN WITH METHODS WHICH WE CANNOT USE AND
SO ROB US OF THE CREDIT
THERE SHALL BE NO SUCH ROBBERY MACKINNON I ASSURE YOU THAT I
EFFACE MYSELF FROM NOW ONWARD AND AS TO BARKER HE HAS DONE NOTHING
SAVE WHAT I TOLD HIM
THE INSPECTOR SEEMED CONSIDERABLY RELIEVED
THAT IS VERY HANDSOME OF YOU MR HOLMES PRAISE OR BLAME CAN MATTER
LITTLE TO YOU BUT IT IS VERY DIFFERENT TO US WHEN THE NEWSPAPERS
BEGIN TO ASK QUESTIONS
QUITE SO BUT THEY ARE PRETTY SURE TO ASK QUESTIONS ANYHOW SO IT
WOULD BE AS WELL TO HAVE ANSWERS WHAT WILL YOU SAY FOR EXAMPLE
WHEN THE INTELLIGENT AND ENTERPRISING REPORTER ASKS YOU WHAT THE
EXACT POINTS WERE WHICH AROUSED YOUR SUSPICION AND FINALLY GAVE YOU
A CERTAIN CONVICTION AS TO THE REAL FACTS
THE INSPECTOR LOOKED PUZZLED
WE DONT SEEM TO HAVE GOT ANY REAL FACTS YET MR HOLMES YOU SAY
THAT THE PRISONER IN THE PRESENCE OF THREE WITNESSES PRACTICALLY
CONFESSED BY TRYING TO COMMIT SUICIDE THAT HE HAD MURDERED HIS WIFE
AND HER LOVER WHAT OTHER FACTS HAVE YOU
HAVE YOU ARRANGED FOR A SEARCH
THERE ARE THREE CONSTABLES ON THEIR WAY
THEN YOU WILL SOON GET THE CLEAREST FACT OF ALL THE BODIES CANNOT
BE FAR AWAY TRY THE CELLARS AND THE GARDEN IT SHOULD NOT TAKE LONG
TO DIG UP THE LIKELY PLACES THIS HOUSE IS OLDER THAN THE
WATERPIPES THERE MUST BE A DISUSED WELL SOMEWHERE TRY YOUR LUCK
THERE
BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW OF IT AND HOW WAS IT DONE
ILL SHOW YOU FIRST HOW IT WAS DONE AND THEN I WILL GIVE THE
EXPLANATION WHICH IS DUE TO YOU AND EVEN MORE TO MY LONGSUFFERING
FRIEND HERE WHO HAS BEEN INVALUABLE THROUGHOUT BUT FIRST I WOULD
GIVE YOU AN INSIGHT INTO THIS MANS MENTALITY IT IS A VERY UNUSUAL
ONESO MUCH SO THAT I THINK HIS DESTINATION IS MORE LIKELY TO BE
BROADMOOR THAN THE SCAFFOLD HE HAS TO A HIGH DEGREE THE SORT OF
MIND WHICH ONE ASSOCIATES WITH THE MEDIAEVAL ITALIAN NATURE RATHER
THAN WITH THE MODERN BRITON HE WAS A MISERABLE MISER WHO MADE HIS
WIFE SO WRETCHED BY HIS NIGGARDLY WAYS THAT SHE WAS A READY PREY FOR
ANY ADVENTURER SUCH A ONE CAME UPON THE SCENE IN THE PERSON OF THIS
CHESSPLAYING DOCTOR AMBERLEY EXCELLED AT CHESSONE MARK WATSON
OF A SCHEMING MIND LIKE ALL MISERS HE WAS A JEALOUS MAN AND HIS
JEALOUSY BECAME A FRANTIC MANIA RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY HE SUSPECTED AN
INTRIGUE HE DETERMINED TO HAVE HIS REVENGE AND HE PLANNED IT WITH
DIABOLICAL CLEVERNESS COME HERE
HOLMES LED US ALONG THE PASSAGE WITH AS MUCH CERTAINTY AS IF HE HAD
LIVED IN THE HOUSE AND HALTED AT THE OPEN DOOR OF THE STRONGROOM
POOH WHAT AN AWFUL SMELL OF PAINT CRIED THE INSPECTOR
THAT WAS OUR FIRST CLUE SAID HOLMES YOU CAN THANK DR WATSONS
OBSERVATION FOR THAT THOUGH HE FAILED TO DRAW THE INFERENCE IT SET
MY FOOT UPON THE TRAIL WHY SHOULD THIS MAN AT SUCH A TIME BE FILLING
HIS HOUSE WITH STRONG ODOURS OBVIOUSLY TO COVER SOME OTHER SMELL
WHICH HE WISHED TO CONCEALSOME GUILTY SMELL WHICH WOULD SUGGEST
SUSPICIONS THEN CAME THE IDEA OF A ROOM SUCH AS YOU SEE HERE WITH
IRON DOOR AND SHUTTERA HERMETICALLY SEALED ROOM PUT THOSE TWO
FACTS TOGETHER AND WHITHER DO THEY LEAD I COULD ONLY DETERMINE THAT
BY EXAMINING THE HOUSE MYSELF I WAS ALREADY CERTAIN THAT THE CASE
WAS SERIOUS FOR I HAD EXAMINED THE BOXOFFICE CHART AT THE HAYMARKET
THEATREANOTHER OF DR WATSONS BULLSEYESAND ASCERTAINED THAT
NEITHER B THIRTY NOR THIRTYTWO OF THE UPPER CIRCLE HAD BEEN OCCUPIED
THAT NIGHT THEREFORE AMBERLEY HAD NOT BEEN TO THE THEATRE AND HIS
ALIBI FELL TO THE GROUND HE MADE A BAD SLIP WHEN HE ALLOWED MY
ASTUTE FRIEND TO NOTICE THE NUMBER OF THE SEAT TAKEN FOR HIS WIFE
THE QUESTION NOW AROSE HOW I MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXAMINE THE HOUSE I
SENT AN AGENT TO THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE VILLAGE I COULD THINK OF AND
SUMMONED MY MAN TO IT AT SUCH AN HOUR THAT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY GET
BACK TO PREVENT ANY MISCARRIAGE DR WATSON ACCOMPANIED HIM THE
GOOD VICARS NAME I TOOK OF COURSE OUT OF MY CROCKFORD DO I MAKE
IT ALL CLEAR TO YOU
IT IS MASTERLY SAID THE INSPECTOR IN AN AWED VOICE
THERE BEING NO FEAR OF INTERRUPTION I PROCEEDED TO BURGLE THE HOUSE
BURGLARY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ALTERNATIVE PROFESSION HAD I CARED TO
ADOPT IT AND I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT I SHOULD HAVE COME TO THE
FRONT OBSERVE WHAT I FOUND YOU SEE THE GASPIPE ALONG THE SKIRTING
HERE VERY GOOD IT RISES IN THE ANGLE OF THE WALL AND THERE IS A
TAP HERE IN THE CORNER THE PIPE RUNS OUT INTO THE STRONGROOM AS
YOU CAN SEE AND ENDS IN THAT PLASTER ROSE IN THE CENTRE OF THE
CEILING WHERE IT IS CONCEALED BY THE ORNAMENTATION THAT END IS WIDE
OPEN AT ANY MOMENT BY TURNING THE OUTSIDE TAP THE ROOM COULD BE
FLOODED WITH GAS WITH DOOR AND SHUTTER CLOSED AND THE TAP FULL ON I
WOULD NOT GIVE TWO MINUTES OF CONSCIOUS SENSATION TO ANYONE SHUT UP
IN THAT LITTLE CHAMBER BY WHAT DEVILISH DEVICE HE DECOYED THEM THERE
I DO NOT KNOW BUT ONCE INSIDE THE DOOR THEY WERE AT HIS MERCY
THE INSPECTOR EXAMINED THE PIPE WITH INTEREST ONE OF OUR OFFICERS
MENTIONED THE SMELL OF GAS SAID HE BUT OF COURSE THE WINDOW AND
DOOR WERE OPEN THEN AND THE PAINTOR SOME OF ITWAS ALREADY ABOUT
HE HAD BEGUN THE WORK OF PAINTING THE DAY BEFORE ACCORDING TO HIS
STORY BUT WHAT NEXT MR HOLMES
WELL THEN CAME AN INCIDENT WHICH WAS RATHER UNEXPECTED TO MYSELF I
WAS SLIPPING THROUGH THE PANTRY WINDOW IN THE EARLY DAWN WHEN I FELT
A HAND INSIDE MY COLLAR AND A VOICE SAID NOW YOU RASCAL WHAT ARE
YOU DOING IN THERE WHEN I COULD TWIST MY HEAD ROUND I LOOKED INTO
THE TINTED SPECTACLES OF MY FRIEND AND RIVAL MR BARKER IT WAS A
CURIOUS FOREGATHERING AND SET US BOTH SMILING IT SEEMS THAT HE HAD
BEEN ENGAGED BY DR RAY ERNESTS FAMILY TO MAKE SOME INVESTIGATIONS
AND HAD COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION AS TO FOUL PLAY HE HAD WATCHED
THE HOUSE FOR SOME DAYS AND HAD SPOTTED DR WATSON AS ONE OF THE
OBVIOUSLY SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS WHO HAD CALLED THERE HE COULD HARDLY
ARREST WATSON BUT WHEN HE SAW A MAN ACTUALLY CLIMBING OUT OF THE
PANTRY WINDOW THERE CAME A LIMIT TO HIS RESTRAINT OF COURSE I TOLD
HIM HOW MATTERS STOOD AND WE CONTINUED THE CASE TOGETHER
WHY HIM WHY NOT US
BECAUSE IT WAS IN MY MIND TO PUT THAT LITTLE TEST WHICH ANSWERED SO
ADMIRABLY I FEAR YOU WOULD NOT HAVE GONE SO FAR
THE INSPECTOR SMILED
WELL MAYBE NOT I UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE YOUR WORD MR HOLMES
THAT YOU STEP RIGHT OUT OF THE CASE NOW AND THAT YOU TURN ALL YOUR
RESULTS OVER TO US
CERTAINLY THAT IS ALWAYS MY CUSTOM
WELL IN THE NAME OF THE FORCE I THANK YOU IT SEEMS A CLEAR CASE
AS YOU PUT IT AND THERE CANT BE MUCH DIFFICULTY OVER THE BODIES
ILL SHOW YOU A GRIM LITTLE BIT OF EVIDENCE SAID HOLMES AND I AM
SURE AMBERLEY HIMSELF NEVER OBSERVED IT YOULL GET RESULTS
INSPECTOR BY ALWAYS PUTTING YOURSELF IN THE OTHER FELLOWS PLACE
AND THINKING WHAT YOU WOULD DO YOURSELF IT TAKES SOME IMAGINATION
BUT IT PAYS NOW WE WILL SUPPOSE THAT YOU WERE SHUT UP IN THIS
LITTLE ROOM HAD NOT TWO MINUTES TO LIVE BUT WANTED TO GET EVEN WITH
THE FIEND WHO WAS PROBABLY MOCKING AT YOU FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
DOOR WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WRITE A MESSAGE
EXACTLY YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE HOW YOU DIED NO USE WRITING
ON PAPER THAT WOULD BE SEEN IF YOU WROTE ON THE WALL SOMEONE MIGHT
REST UPON IT NOW LOOK HERE JUST ABOVE THE SKIRTING IS SCRIBBLED
WITH A PURPLE INDELIBLE PENCIL WE WE THATS ALL
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT
WELL ITS ONLY A FOOT ABOVE THE GROUND THE POOR DEVIL WAS ON THE
FLOOR DYING WHEN HE WROTE IT HE LOST HIS SENSES BEFORE HE COULD
FINISH
HE WAS WRITING WE WERE MURDERED
THATS HOW I READ IT IF YOU FIND AN INDELIBLE PENCIL ON THE BODY
WELL LOOK OUT FOR IT YOU MAY BE SURE BUT THOSE SECURITIES
CLEARLY THERE WAS NO ROBBERY AT ALL AND YET HE DID POSSESS THOSE
BONDS WE VERIFIED THAT
YOU MAY BE SURE HE HAS THEM HIDDEN IN A SAFE PLACE WHEN THE WHOLE
ELOPEMENT HAD PASSED INTO HISTORY HE WOULD SUDDENLY DISCOVER THEM
AND ANNOUNCE THAT THE GUILTY COUPLE HAD RELENTED AND SENT BACK THE
PLUNDER OR HAD DROPPED IT ON THE WAY
YOU CERTAINLY SEEM TO HAVE MET EVERY DIFFICULTY SAID THE
INSPECTOR OF COURSE HE WAS BOUND TO CALL US IN BUT WHY HE SHOULD
HAVE GONE TO YOU I CANT UNDERSTAND
PURE SWANK HOLMES ANSWERED HE FELT SO CLEVER AND SO SURE OF
HIMSELF THAT HE IMAGINED NO ONE COULD TOUCH HIM HE COULD SAY TO ANY
SUSPICIOUS NEIGHBOUR LOOK AT THE STEPS I HAVE TAKEN I HAVE
CONSULTED NOT ONLY THE POLICE BUT EVEN SHERLOCK HOLMES
THE INSPECTOR LAUGHED
WE MUST FORGIVE YOU YOUR EVEN MR HOLMES SAID HE ITS AS
WORKMANLIKE A JOB AS I CAN REMEMBER
A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER MY FRIEND TOSSED ACROSS TO ME A COPY OF THE
BIWEEKLY NORTH SURREY OBSERVER UNDER A SERIES OF FLAMING HEADLINES
WHICH BEGAN WITH THE HAVEN HORROR AND ENDED WITH BRILLIANT POLICE
INVESTIGATION THERE WAS A PACKED COLUMN OF PRINT WHICH GAVE THE
FIRST CONSECUTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE AFFAIR THE CONCLUDING PARAGRAPH IS
TYPICAL OF THE WHOLE IT RAN THUS
THE REMARKABLE ACUMEN BY WHICH INSPECTOR MACKINNON DEDUCED FROM THE
SMELL OF PAINT THAT SOME OTHER SMELL THAT OF GAS FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT
BE CONCEALED THE BOLD DEDUCTION THAT THE STRONGROOM MIGHT ALSO BE
THE DEATHCHAMBER AND THE SUBSEQUENT INQUIRY WHICH LED TO THE
DISCOVERY OF THE BODIES IN A DISUSED WELL CLEVERLY CONCEALED BY A
DOGKENNEL SHOULD LIVE IN THE HISTORY OF CRIME AS A STANDING EXAMPLE
OF THE INTELLIGENCE OF OUR PROFESSIONAL DETECTIVES
WELL WELL MACKINNON IS A GOOD FELLOW SAID HOLMES WITH A TOLERANT
SMILE YOU CAN FILE IT IN OUR ARCHIVES WATSON SOME DAY THE TRUE
STORY MAY BE TOLD
